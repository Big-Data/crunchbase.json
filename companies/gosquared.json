It lets you see which pages of your site are most popular, where your visitors are coming from, and info on every visitor currently browsing your website along with how they&#8217;re browsing (what browser, operating system, screen size, etc.), which language they&#8217;re speaking, and what city they&#8217;re from.</p>\n\n<p>LiveStats doesn&#8217;t just tell you who&#8217;s on your site, it also knows what page they&#8217;re on, and what pages they&#8217;ve been on. It know&#8217;s where they&#8217;ve come from (Twitter, Digg, Google, etc.) making it easy to see when someone&#8217;s talking about you.</p>\n\n<p>Trends takes all the data in LiveStats and builds beautiful, easy to read charts and tables so that you can analyse how your website has been performing over the past day, week, month, or year. Trends enables you to gain insights into your website&#8217;s traffic data quicker than ever before - without having to click a single button.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/3058/33058v4-max-150x150.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/3058/33058v4-max-250x250.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/3058/33058v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Liquidicity -
