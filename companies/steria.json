The joint solution puts customer preferences at the heart of service providersâ€™ offering, affording them the flexibility for solutions to be precisely customized, therefore improving customer experience while optimizing revenues.\r\n\r\nThe solution created by Steria and FTS provides operators with a next-generation billing platform that is agile and intuitive, allowing the rapid launch of new offerings in line with the complexity of the constantly changing service provider environment. Marketing teams can now independently configure new services, new offerings or attractive special promotions in record time.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur solution makes the customer central to the billing system by monitoring their usage in real time,â€ commented Nir Asulin, VP Operations, FTS. â€œAn extremely intuitive modelling system, the DO Treeâ„¢, allows the marketing function to build pricing rules and models which take into account each customerâ€™s usage patterns and the richness of the choices they make. We are very pleased with this partnership with Steria, as the complementary nature of our companies allows us to broaden our future prospects together.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWith Steriaâ€™s expertise in the telecommunications market and our familiarity with the business challenges facing this sector, we can now provide a next-generation billing offering that addresses the difficulties faced by the market which we witness first-hand,â€ said Thierry Gohon, Director of Telecoms Development, Steria France. â€œTesting a new offering, attracting a specific target audience to a new type of service, even rewarding certain behaviors, â€™Steria Agile Billingâ€™ provides the responsiveness operators need to meet their major business challenges: pricing, customization and time to market. These challenges are central to the transformation projects we are currently conducting for the major players in a constantly changing market.â€ ","source_description":"Steria France Partners with FTS to Launch â€œSteria Agile Billingâ€ Solutions for Service Providers","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Steria","permalink":"steria"}},{"description":"test","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"http://www.vg.no","source_text":null,"source_description":"wikipedia.org","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Steria","permalink":"steria"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
