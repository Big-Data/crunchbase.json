Ritter&#8217;s first target compound, RG28, has the potential to become the first FDA 혨approved drug for the treatment of lactose intolerance, a condition that effects 80 million Americans and 4.3 billion worldwide. R혨G28 works by stimulating the colonic growth and colonizing lactose 혨fermenting bacteria in the colon, which reduces lactose 혨derived gas production, and thereby mitigates the symptoms of lactose intolerance. The drug is a 35 day treatment and only periodic maintenance treatments are needed thereafter.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0015/9088/159088v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0015/9088/159088v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,151],"assets/images/resized/0015/9088/159088v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Ritter","permalink":"andrew-ritter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Markowitz","permalink":"steve-markowitz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,78],"assets/images/resized/0001/8741/18741v1-max-150x150.png"],[[80,78],"assets/images/resized/0001/8741/18741v1-max-250x250.png"],[[80,78],"assets/images/resized/0001/8741/18741v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Ritter","permalink":"michael-ritter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0013/3358/133358v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0013/3358/133358v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0013/3358/133358v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Los Angeles, CA","address1":"1880 Century Park East","address2":"Suite 1100","zip_code":"90067","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
