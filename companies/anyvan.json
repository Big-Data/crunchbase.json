This benefits the environment and saves time and money.</p>\n\n<p>Overview</p>\n\n<p>Anyvan is a web-based delivery auction service. Customers who need items shipped in the UK or abroad are teamed up with transport providers via an on-line bidding system. The transport providersâ€™ bid on listed jobs that can be added to part of their planned schedule thereby offering a reduced delivery charge and saving CO2. The site enables people to negotiate the best price and view the ratings and reviews from other Anyvan jobs to help them chose the best provider for the job. </p>\n\n<p>Anyvan is said to have had requests from yachts to a stuffed grizzly bear and has saved more than 2.8 million miles in extra delivery journeys. It has also reported a considerable increase in the number of private car owners offering to transport items, enabling people to cover fuel costs or make extra money when travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Anyvan is free for customers to use but charges a commission to the company/person transporting an item.</p>\n\n<p>History</p>\n\n<p>Anyvan was founded by Angus Elphinstone and Ben Goor in March 2009. Elphinstone, who was running a white van delivery business, often received calls from customers who wanted something moved but could not afford the cost of a one off job. He was also said to be fed up with sitting in traffic jams with an empty load on his return trip. He therefore decided to link up with customers in the towns and cities he was travelling to so that he could deliver their items on his return journey and make full use of the round trip. Anyvan.com was launched in October 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Environmental Impact</p>\n\n<p>By connecting transport providers with more customers, Anyvan helps them combine their loads with other couriers to keep the vans on the roads fuller. This reduces the amount of transport needed for the job and results in decreased CO2 emissions and traffic congestion. The average reduction in CO2 emissions on anyvan.com is reported as 274kg of CO2 per listing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0018/7884/187884v2-max-150x150.png"],[[249,69],"assets/images/resized/0018/7884/187884v2-max-250x250.png"],[[249,69],"assets/images/resized/0018/7884/187884v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Angus","last_name":"Elphinstone","permalink":"angus-elphinstone-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"uShip","permalink":"uship","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London Office","address1":"G4, Shepherds Building","address2":"Charecroft Way","zip_code":"W14 0EH","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"German Office","address1":"Walhofer Str. 102","address2":"","zip_code":"69123","city":"Heidelberg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/7883/187883v2-max-150x150.png"],[[207,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/7883/187883v2-max-250x250.png"],[[373,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/7883/187883v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/139763","title":"Revolutionising the Transport Industry"},{"external_url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/caraccessories/8343488/Earn-money-by-using-your-car-for-courier-work.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/mar/12/make-a-delivery-petrol-costs","title":"Combatting Petrol Prices"},{"external_url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-1298909/There-new-ways-shift-furniture-neednt-cost-earth.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.thegoodwebguide.co.uk/website-of-the-year/awards-2010/website-of-the-year-winner-2010-anyvan/13048","title":"Website of the Year 2010"}]}
