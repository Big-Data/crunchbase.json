With more than 140 Social Media Specialists in 12 locations around the world, Brandtology is able to verify automated sentiment analysis and provide localised insights in more than 12 different languages.</p>\n\n<p>Brandtology offers two services, the first being an Ongoing Monitoring Service and the second a Brand Audit.  Both services track online conversations across a multitude of social media channels, including blogs, forums, review sites, news sites, Youtube and Twitter, among others.</p>\n\n<p>1) Ongoing Monitoring Service</p>\n\n<p>This is a daily monitoring service for typically 6- 12 months where Brandtology tracks and analyzes what has been said about our clientsâ€™ business and brand for the past 24 hours. Daily and monthly reports are sent to the client highlighting significant issues and the sentiment trends of netizens towards their business, brand and competitors. Actionable insights are also provided based on the most popular themes in these conversations, the most influential and/or active netizensâ€™ comments and the top conversations channels of these. This gives clients a blow by blow account of the online conversations surrounding their products and services, as well as near realtime feedback on their campaigns/launches. Astute use of such intelligence has enabled Brandtologyâ€™s global clients to make timely and informed strategic decisions for public engagement, crisis management and media planning, amongst other uses.</p>\n\n<p>2) Online Conversation Brand Audit</p>\n\n<p>For the Online Conversation Brand Audit, Brandtology helps clients to track the online conversations which has already happened in the past 2-4 months to come up with a comprehensive brand audit report on their positioning vis-Ã -vis their competitors and insights into the key conversations and trends online. It is also used as a periodic method of measuring if their past campaigns/launches have been successful in increasing buzz and/or altering sentiments towards their business and brand. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,12],"assets/images/resized/0004/2651/42651v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,20],"assets/images/resized/0004/2651/42651v1-max-250x250.png"],[[334,27],"assets/images/resized/0004/2651/42651v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder &  Managing Director (North Asia)","person":{"first_name":"Eden","last_name":"Lau","permalink":"eden-lau-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eddie","last_name":"Chau","permalink":"eddie-chau-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Alvin","last_name":"Chan","permalink":"alvin-chan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Business Development Director","person":{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"Choo","permalink":"kelly-choo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/3669/63669v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,200],"assets/images/resized/0006/3669/63669v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,200],"assets/images/resized/0006/3669/63669v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Kelly Choo</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eddie","last_name":"Chau","permalink":"eddie-chau","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & VP of Research & Development","person":{"first_name":"Alvin","last_name":"Chan","permalink":"alvin-chan-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Managing Director of North Asia","person":{"first_name":"Eden","last_name":"Lau","permalink":"eden-lau","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.35M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/brandtology-raises-135-million-for-advanced-social-media-tracking/","source_description":"Brandtology Raises $1.35 Million For Advanced Social Media Tracking","raised_amount":1350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":27,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Walden International","permalink":"walden-international","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/9748/19748v1-max-150x150.png"],[[159,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/9748/19748v1-max-250x250.png"],[[159,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/9748/19748v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/17/media-monitors-acquires-social-media-tracking-company-brandtology/","source_description":"Media Monitors Acquires Social Media Tracking Company Brandtology","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":2,"acquired_day":17,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Media Monitors","permalink":"media-monitors","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0012/2683/122683v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,79],"assets/images/resized/0012/2683/122683v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,79],"assets/images/resized/0012/2683/122683v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Singapore (Intl HQ)","address1":"22 Changi South Avenue 2","address2":"UPS House #02-05","zip_code":"486064","city":"Singapore","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"USA ","address1":"3 Twin Dolphin Drive","address2":"Suite 150, Redwood City","zip_code":"94065","city":"CA","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"China - Shanghai","address1":"Room 1801-1803, 18F, Westgate Tower,","address2":"No.1038 Nanjing West Road,","zip_code":"200041","city":"Shanghai","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"HangZhou (North Asia HQ)","address1":"Room 801,8th Floor,Building No.6 of Singapore-Hangzhou Science and Technology Park","address2":"No.2 Science Park Rd","zip_code":"310018","city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"CHN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Australia ","address1":"Level 31,ABN-AMRO Tower,","address2":"88 Phillip Street,","zip_code":"NSW 2000","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Malaysia","address1":"Suite E08-21, Block E,Plaza Mont' Kiara","address2":"No. 2, Jalan Kiara, Mont' Kiara","zip_code":"50480","city":"Kuala Lumpur","state_code":null,"country_code":"MYS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.webmetricsguru.com/archives/2010/03/brandtology-social-media-monitoring/","title":"Review of Brandtology by Webmetricsguru"}]}
