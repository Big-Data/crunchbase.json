CeeLite LEC panels are thin (approximately one millimeter), flexible and lightweight light sources that may be used on flat or curved surfaces to illuminate the surface itself and to provide illuminated advertising, signs and architectural surfaces. LEC technology is distinct from existing lighting sources and is considered to be a separate category of products from anything currently available in the lighting industry. CeeLite LEC technology can be easily configured to work with existing technologies, enabling its delivery and use in a large number of end-use products. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/2545/2545v1-max-150x150.png"],[[204,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/2545/2545v1-max-250x250.png"],[[204,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/2545/2545v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Malcolm","last_name":"Hayward","permalink":"malcolm-hayward","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"HP","last_name":"Huang","permalink":"hp-huang","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Vice President, Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Gabrielle","last_name":"Santulli","permalink":"gabrielle-santulli","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"senior VP Business Development, OEM","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Binder","permalink":"michael-binder","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Corporate Development Officer & Legal Counsel","person":{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"Kiefer","permalink":"lawrence-kiefer","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Senior VP Business Development, Distribution","person":{"first_name":"Donald","last_name":"Sowers, Sr.","permalink":"donald-sowers-sr","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/12/21/ceelite-maker-of-light-emitting-capacitors-takes-4m/","source_description":"VentureBeat","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The Musser Group","permalink":"the-musser-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0003/0330/30330v1-max-150x150.png"],[[152,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/0330/30330v1-max-250x250.png"],[[152,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/0330/30330v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"475 Sentry Parkway Suite 3000","address2":null,"zip_code":"19422","city":"Blue Bell","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.133541,"longitude":-75.275284}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
