The bookmarklet will open a small box on top of the store telling you that &#8220;You are shopping at WidgetStore, click here to green this purchase&#8221;&#8230; When you click it you are sent right back to the store, where you can complete your purchase as usual&#8230; Nothing changes in your shopping experience beyond that small click&#8230; But that small click has a big environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind GAS is very simple&#8230; Instead of spending years waiting and convincing retailers to go green and change their practices, GAS uses existing business practices that make sense to retailers and that they all support&#8230; affiliate marketing.</p>\n\n<p>The &#8220;green this purchase&#8221; link is actually an affiliate link, created in real-time based on where you clicked the bookmarklet from, and leading right back to where you were shopping&#8230; So when you click the bookmarklet, you&#8217;re basically telling the site that GAS sent you, and they pay GAS a commission for referring you to them&#8230; Each month, GAS donates 100% of the affiliate fees received to environmental organizations (chosen and voted on by GAS users).</p>\n\n<p>GAS is completely transparent to its users, publishing monthly reports of how much money was raised and donated, and even publishing financial and affiliate reports when such actions are not against the affiliate program terms.</p>\n\n<p>GAS&#8217;s business plan is based on extremely targeted, ethical advertising at the time of purchase&#8230; For example, when you&#8217;re about to buy a book online and click GAS, you may see a small notice next to the &#8220;green this!&#8221; window suggesting you save an extra tree and buy the audio or e-book instead. This space may also be used for green tips such as suggesting places to recycle your old phone when you purchase a new one.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/0223/30223v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/0223/30223v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/0223/30223v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Green Any Site","permalink":"green-any-site","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Tal","last_name":"Ater","permalink":"tal-ater","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Ramat Hasharon","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0003/0222/30222v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,112],"assets/images/resized/0003/0222/30222v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,202],"assets/images/resized/0003/0222/30222v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
