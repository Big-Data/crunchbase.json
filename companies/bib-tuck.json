The website offers a simple process to sell items which involves uploading a stylized picture, pricing, and then shipping it off to the buyer.  In return, members receive online currency called &#8220;bucks&#8221; which they can then use to purchase items themselves.  Although Bib + Tuck is not the first site to recognize the need for women to both give and receive fashion pieces, itâ€™s the first to emphasize social transparency, moneyless transactions, and attractive visuals.  The site is currently invitation-only.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sari","last_name":"Azout","permalink":"sari-azout","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sari","last_name":"Bibliowicz","permalink":"sari-bibliowicz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
