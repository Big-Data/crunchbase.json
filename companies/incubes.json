The [IN]cubated companies we accelerate and present to you upon their graduation, have had their market entry, technology plans, and business models put through a rigorous qualification process by experts chosen as the ultimate to represent their individual market potential. Investment in emerging internet technology companies is high risk, and high return. We eliminate much of that risk through our expert incubation period, and we also present you with all the background and market research you’ll need to affirm and qualify the details of each opportunity. This is why incubators around the world are in such demand. Early phase technology investment is proven through boom and bubble, to be among the highest returns of any industry.
