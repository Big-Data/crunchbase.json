You may also find new spas and hot tubs for sale.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1998 Used Spa Lotâ€™s parent company has been &#8220;putting products in the path of people doing what they do&#8221;, in both retail stores and the web. As the website grew to astronomical proportions, the focus became &#8220;the focused shopper&#8221;. While researching a major purchase was the primary use of the Internet - it quickly became a way for Sellers in one corner of the country and Buyers in another to come together.</p>\n\n<p>The Used <strong><em>_ Lot concept is a take from the old trusted Used Car Lot that was a corner stone in every town and city across the country. Where buyers are looking for a great value, and sellers are looking to move inventory with the lowest sales cost. Now the web becomes the street that old trusted lot resides. Each Used _</strong></em> Lot will have itâ€™s own personality and will talk in plain talk (sometimes even down right funny). We will also strive to tell it like it is - since we are not affiliated with any manufacturers or retailers, UsedSpaLot will not twist language in a way that blurs the truth. Weâ€™re consumers too.</p>\n\n<p>By focusing on niche markets - buyers and sellers do not have to fight for exposure in an environment of literally millions of items that have nothing to do with what they are looking for.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/7834/37834v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/7834/37834v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[449,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/7834/37834v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Used Spas","permalink":"used-spas","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"13625 A St","address2":"","zip_code":"68144","city":"Omaha","state_code":"NE","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.224344,"longitude":-96.126587}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
