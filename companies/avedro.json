Avedro recently completed its US‐based, multi-centered, Phase III studies of corneal cross-linking for the treatment of progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Outside the United States, Avedro has commercialized both VibeX and its KXL System for performing Lasik Xtra and accelerated cross-linking. Additionally, Avedro is developing the science of Thermo‐biomechanics for therapeutic medical applications. The Keraflex® refractive correction procedure is the first technology developed from the Thermo‐biomechanics platform and is a non‐invasive, incision‐less ophthalmic procedure for flattening the cornea without the removal of tissue. Keraflex offers the unique ability to induce refractive change without weakening the cornea’s biomechanical integrity, as happens with Lasik and other refractive correction procedures. Keraflex is commercially available outside of the United States.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0011/6796/116796v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0011/6796/116796v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0011/6796/116796v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Muller","permalink":"david-muller","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"C.","last_name":"Evan Ballantyne","permalink":"c-evan-ballantyne","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$44.8M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/01/03/daily50-Avedros-laser-surgery-tech-attracts-63M.html","source_description":"Avedro's laser surgery tech attracts $6.3M","raised_amount":6300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":6,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/05/09/daily9-Laser-vision-firm-Avedro-bumps-funding-to-13M.html","source_description":"Laser vision firm Avedro bumps funding to $13M","raised_amount":13000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":9,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/07/04/daily26-Med-device-maker-Avedro-raises-25M.html","source_description":"Med device maker Avedro raises $25M","raised_amount":25000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":7,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SCP Vitalife Partners","permalink":"scp-vitalife-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0004/9810/49810v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[210,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/9810/49810v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[210,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/9810/49810v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Aperture Venture Partners","permalink":"aperture-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0006/2293/62293v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/2293/62293v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[208,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/2293/62293v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2012/02/20/daily3-Avedro-adds-500K-to-recent-fundraise.html","source_description":"Avedro adds $500K to recent fundraise","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SCP Vitalife Partners","permalink":"scp-vitalife-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0004/9810/49810v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[210,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/9810/49810v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[210,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/9810/49810v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"M.","last_name":"Carl Johnson III","permalink":"m-carl-johnson-iii","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"230 Third Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"02451","city":"Waltham","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0011/6797/116797v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0011/6797/116797v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,355],"assets/images/resized/0011/6797/116797v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
