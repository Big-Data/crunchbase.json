We want to make everyone’s passions accessible, and most importantly, help to discover new ones.</p>\n\n<p>ZOZI, based in San Francisco, is rapidly expanding as the trusted brand for adventure.  Discover and book extraordinary experiences around the corner, around the world, and with celebrity expert guides. ZOZI offers everything from midnight kayaking, abalone diving and urban zip lining to oyster farming, white water rafting, training with Olympic gold medalists, and the gear needed to take on such adventures. ZOZI is committed to curating best in class experiences delivered with phenomenal customer service.</p>\n\n<p>It all started when our founder and CEO traveled the world and found it surprisingly difficult to find and book local activities and travel adventures.
