If youâ€™re in LA, and you want to meet some people to fix your situation as a single man or woman, you should see Thelek.com. Apparently, a lek is a place where animals gather for courtship behavior, and this site is just that. Once youâ€™re on the site, youâ€™ll be able to join and create a profile, so you can start meeting people. Youâ€™ll be able to tell the site what your favorite LA nightspots are. This will allow you to find people who frequent these same places, making getting to know them easier. Users will be able to post up events for others to know about and attend. This is great for anyone not that familiar with the LA scene to find something to do in the always-interesting LA night. In the long run, the site is poised to become a paid service, but if you join now, youâ€™ll never have to pay for networking with your LA peers. </p>","image":null,"products":[{"name":"Online Dating site","permalink":"online-dating-site","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Chandler","last_name":"Evans","permalink":"chandler-evans","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Kurtz","permalink":"david-kurtz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Chandos","last_name":"Erwin","permalink":"chandos-erwin","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"eHarmony","permalink":"eharmony","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"OkCupid","permalink":"okcupid","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/8520/38520v1-max-150x150.png"],[[159,80],"assets/images/resized/0003/8520/38520v1-max-250x250.png"],[[159,80],"assets/images/resized/0003/8520/38520v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Law Firm","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Bloom, Hergot, Diemer","permalink":"bloom-hergot-diemer","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"620 Venice Blvd.","address2":"","zip_code":"90291","city":"Venice","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":33.9896157,"longitude":-118.4613336}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thelek.com/article/the-lek-on-abcnews-com/1094","title":"ABCNews: Dating on TheLEK.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Social-Networking/thelek-com-la-dating-for-dummies","title":"KillerStartups: TheLEK.com"}]}
