Client’s understanding of processes done behind the scenes contributes to a feeling of security. Escorting a customer through his first steps ever breaking into the Online World can be difficult, so we put most emphasis on the transfer of information to the customer.

In fact, if you’re not On-Line – You do not exist, this is how it is today. Having a website is a long and sometimes tiring process of learning and improving as it is on-line and everyone can connect to it at all times. We feel that there are many companies that offer a wide range of services but still no internet company that brings real progress in front of the modern web surfer. Nowadays, Madyzine is in the process of breaking into the competition as the most innovative company in the design field, where the design emphasis is at the use of Web 2.0 technology.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0020/1014/201014v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[247,70],"assets/images/resized/0020/1014/201014v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[247,70],"assets/images/resized/0020/1014/201014v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"Gal","permalink":"dennis-gal","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Burshtein","permalink":"michael-burshtein","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"Churgin 22","address2":"","zip_code":"52356","city":"Ramat Gan","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
