I was given a gift by God. </p>\n\n<p>Similar to a crystal ball but not a reliable and not as fun as x-ray vision; To take very little and turn it into something grand by seeing things differently than most people see it or choose to see it. No, I&#8217;m not bragging I have the history to prove it. </p>\n\n<p>I welcome rejections, thrive in turmoil, challenges only harden my determination to achieve my goal. What makes me different is that I have always been the square peg in a world of round holes! I have a bad case of low T. That&#8217;s low tolerance for people that say it cannot be done or it&#8217;s has been done. I am addicted to PPC and often overdoes on HWH. Dying to know what PPC is? Got to contact me to find out&#8230;three minutes on the phone with me and you&#8217;ll know if I am the Marketing Guy for you. </p>\n\n<p>If you are looking for a list of achievements that I have accomplished I can have you call my mom ( she&#8217;d love to hear from you) but I am not going to fill this space of all the &#8220;stuff&#8221; that &#8220;diplomas, awards, and certifications I have been awarded of my life.</p>\n\n<p>If you need my mom&#8217;s phone number I am glad to give it to you. If you want to skip the four hours on the phone with her. Try Google. Keywords: John Erickson, Atronic Alarms, John the Alarm Guy, John the Marketing Guy, 3 and 2 Baseball of Johnson County.
