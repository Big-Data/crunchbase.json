Since that conversation ContactJam has grown into a full social network, iPhone Application, and Android Application that delivers on that inspiration.  </p>\n\n<p>The game itself encourages users to connect with other users when they meet.  Connections are automatically recorded and made on the social network, with buttons and prizes being awarded for the various types of people you interact with.</p>\n\n<p>The social network and game has been built via Kevin&#8217;s personal funds with the help of a team of developer friends.   It aims to use its game dynamics to become a viral sensation. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5062/125062v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5062/125062v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/5062/125062v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Tycho","last_name":"Luyben","permalink":"tycho-luyben","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & President","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Incorvia","permalink":"kevin-incorvia","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Cambridge Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
