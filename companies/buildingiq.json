BuildingIQ&#8217;s suite of software offerings utilizes Predictive Energy Optimization -  the only energy management software platform that forecasts energy demand and automatically adjusts a buildingâ€™s HVAC settings to continuously optimize energy use and peak loads. BuildingIQ works with existing building energy management systems and utility demand response systems, and incorporates weather forecasts, occupant comfort, utility prices and demand response signals in its optimization algorithms. BuildingIQ automatically reduces energy consumption, cost, and emissions while maintaining or improving occupant comfort.  </p>\n\n<p>These offerings reduce energy cost and consumption, helping facility owners, managers and occupants get more value out of their existing energy systems.
