Glaser on â€œBit string compressor with boolean operation processing capability.</p>\n\n<p>Originally encoded on firmware, the application is now completely software based.</p>\n\n<p>Description</p>\n\n<p>A fully tokenized, bit array encoded and compressed database, data storage is column-oriented using domains across schemas/tables rather than as rows of data within tables. This results in an optimized platform for data analytics and data mining, although not suitable for transaction processing.</p>\n\n<p>This architecture exhibits the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All columns act as if they are indexed - Actual data values are stored only once and referenced by their token - Columns use lossless data compression when stored - Only columns requested in a query are accessed from the database - Queries are done directly on the compressed columns and only the result set is decompressed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Platform agnostic, SAND CDBMS runs on 32 and 64 bit Windows or the following 64 bit Linux/Unix environments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* HP-UX\n* IBM-AIX\n* OSF/1\n* Red Hat Linux\n* SuSE Linux\n* Sun Solaris\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0013/3534/133534v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0013/3534/133534v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0013/3534/133534v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"215 Redfern, Suite 410 ","address2":"","zip_code":"H3Z 3L5","city":"Westmount","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"SAND USA","address1":"120 Spring Street  ","address2":"Suite B","zip_code":"94566","city":" Pleasanton","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"SAND Germany","address1":"KattrepelsbrÃ¼cke 1","address2":"","zip_code":" D-20095 ","city":"Hamburg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"SAND UK","address1":"Quatro House ","address2":"Frimley Road","zip_code":"GU16 7ER","city":"Camberley","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
