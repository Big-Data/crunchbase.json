That data is then available to any authorized system that is connected to the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>The unique patent-pending technology enables both NFC enabled phones as well as non-NFC enabled phones to communicate with our connector to the Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Key Benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Incredibly simple installation, plug it in and you are done.\nNo need to integrate with any existing POS system/network (but we can if need be).</li>\n<li>We can easily and securely exchange data with any authenticated system via our secure web accessible API.</li>\n<li>Complete end to end data encapsulation and encryption. You can encrypt your data within the mobile App and decrypt once it arrives at your destination in the Cloud.</li>\n<li>We are carrier neutral so that any retailer may use our system and work with any number of other developers or systems to do as they wish with the data.</li>\n<li>Dual mode of operation â€“ in addition to transmitting via the new NFC chip set and emerging protocols we will have the ability to transmit data with non-NFC enabled mobile devices. This means that while NFC technology is emerging, devices commonly in use today such as iPhone and Android will be able to work with our system while NFC technology emerges in the marketplace.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0017/3351/173351v2-max-150x150.png"],[[165,96],"assets/images/resized/0017/3351/173351v2-max-250x250.png"],[[165,96],"assets/images/resized/0017/3351/173351v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President ","person":{"first_name":"Brandon","last_name":"Kolybaba","permalink":"brandon-kolybaba","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office ","address1":"211 Horseshoe Lake Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"B3S 0B9","city":"Halifax","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
