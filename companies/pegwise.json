Itâ€™s a simple and (if we do say so ourselves) elegant idea.</p>\n\n<p>Each day we feature an item up for auction with a secret reserve price set by the supplier. If a user bids above the secret reserve price, they win the auction and pay the price that they bid. If they do not bid above the secret reserve price they lose the auction and are never charged for their bid. </p>\n\n<p>Itâ€™s still a deal. Itâ€™s still less than retail. But itâ€™s a wiser way to get a price thatâ€™s fairâ€”for everyone. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0013/3666/133666v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0013/3666/133666v6-max-250x250.png"],[[335,111],"assets/images/resized/0013/3666/133666v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Powell","permalink":"andy-powell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jarred","last_name":"Trost","permalink":"jarred-trost-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0014/4270/144270v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0014/4270/144270v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0014/4270/144270v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
