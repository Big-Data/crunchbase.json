Then other users can connect to that &#8220;Live Stream&#8221; to hear that same song at the same time, except in their own headphones plugged into their own device.  Users also have the option to share their playlist with other users in the network.  MyStream can be used to share songs, podcasts, audio-books, standup comedy and or any other unprotect audio file.
