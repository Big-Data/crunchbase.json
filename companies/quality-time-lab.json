The company founders had been keeping in touch for years through video-conference and as strong believers in the ability to being &#8220;present&#8221; through video-conferencing, they were able to experience live events and build strong family relationships and bonds.</p>\n\n<p>200 million people video-conference today to keep in touch, thanks to cameras on all devices, Wi-Fi connectivity everywhere, and an abundance of options for free calls. But while research shows that one of the main reasons people use it is to spend quality time with family, video-conferencing with children is not easy. Children love technology and adapt quickly to new devices and interfaces, but their short attention spans make video-conferencing with long distance family members very challenging. The founders, having extensive knowledge of technology, education and psychology, started working on a solution.</p>\n\n<p>The project came to life in 2012 with the publication of the book “Family video-conferencing” where they adapted more than 100 classic games for video-conference, together with the launch of an innovative desktop application that provides age appropriate content and educational tools to use during video-conferences to strengthen and maintain family relationships. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Meri","last_name":"Rosich","permalink":"meri-rosich","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO ","person":{"first_name":"Kriti","last_name":"Kapoor","permalink":"kriti-kapoor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/1592/211592v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/1592/211592v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/1592/211592v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"Manso","permalink":"emilio-manso","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Content ","person":{"first_name":"Laia","last_name":"Rosich","permalink":"laia-rosich","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Publishers","person":{"first_name":"Josep","last_name":"M.
