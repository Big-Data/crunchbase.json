The company&#8217;s solution, OneMediaHub, enables end users to store, sync and share rich media (e.g. pictures, videos, music), documents/files, and personal data (such as contacts and calendars) across smartphones, PCs/Macs and tablets via the cloud. Funambol differs from other personal cloud solutions in several key ways: as a white-label solution, it enables mobile providers to go to market with their own brand, to build customer loyalty; it works with the broadest array of mobile devices, from multiple manufacturers; it supports more than just files but also personal information managmenet (PIM) data in a mobile-optimized way; and it is highly flexible so that companies can tailor it for their needs and go to market with a differentiated service. Funambol has won major awards and other industry recognition for its cloud storage technology and solutions.
