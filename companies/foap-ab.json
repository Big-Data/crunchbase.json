Snap or upload a photo via our iPhone App and if it gets approved it will be published at www.foap.com for editorial/commercial sale for companies which are looking for marketing material. Each photo can be sold unlimited amount of times, and we split the revenue with on a 50/50 basis. The current price is $10 per photo that is licensed. </p>\n\n<p>The goal is to build a image database that has a constant massive inflow of photos since we know that photo buying companies are looking for more variation. Also, we want to build a database consisting of more natural and local photos, and avoid feeding the market with something that it&#8217;s already overwhelmed of: that is typical arranged stock modeling photos.  </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Los","permalink":"david-los-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Krusenstråhle","permalink":"daniel-krusenstrhle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7976/197976v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,240],"assets/images/resized/0019/7976/197976v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,240],"assets/images/resized/0019/7976/197976v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"Bylund","permalink":"alexandra-bylund-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Seed Investor & Boardmember","person":{"first_name":"Sami","last_name":"Douz","permalink":"sami-douz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor, Advisor and Boardmember","person":{"first_name":"Roland","last_name":"Zeller","permalink":"roland-zeller","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/3642/203642v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/3642/203642v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/3642/203642v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"kr1.75M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"SEK","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"SEK","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"SEK","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":6,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"SEK","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":27,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"SEK","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":25,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Foap HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Malmö","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
