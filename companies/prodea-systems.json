Having a strong legacy steeped in developing solutions for the service provider community, Prodea Systems is uniquely positioned to both understand and solve the complex task of delivering multiple carrier-class, Internet-based applications and services to the consumer. The Prodea Systems platform, for the first time, provides the foundation of a presence network in the home, all created by a Community Engineâ„¢ which connects and enables sharing of content, experiences and applications among peer subscribers, with an ease and simplicity that does not exist today.\nThe Prodea Systems Digital Lifestyle Command Centerâ„¢ is the first end-to-end services delivery platform of its kind â€“ one that comprehends the service providersâ€™ goals to increase subscriber stickiness and ARPU, while at the same time driving a reduction in churn.  This enables the delivery of services to subscribers in a manner consistent with their expectations of quality.  The Prodea Systems platform will uniquely enable carrier-grade services to be delivered directly to a variety of fixed appliances in the home or automobile, as well as mobile lifestyle devices including smart phones, portable media players (PMPs) or laptops.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0006/6757/66757v1-max-150x150.png"],[[235,69],"assets/images/resized/0006/6757/66757v1-max-250x250.png"],[[235,69],"assets/images/resized/0006/6757/66757v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman, CEO and Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Anousheh","last_name":"Ansari","permalink":"anousheh-ansari","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Hamid","last_name":"Ansari","permalink":"hamid-ansari","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$41.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2009/09/14/daily37.html","source_description":"Dallas Business Journal","raised_amount":29500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":16,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2009/11/16/daily14.html","source_description":"Dallas Business Journal","raised_amount":2200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":17,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1461904/000146190410000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D","raised_amount":10000054,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":5,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"6101 W.
