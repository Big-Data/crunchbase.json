Based on SMS, Paywast is available for anybody with a mobile phone operating on AWCC, Afghan Telecom, Etisalat and MTN. This makes Paywast an extremely accessible, low barrier service.</p>\n\n<p>Users of Paywast create and join groups and invite their friends to join along with them. Groups are used for sharing information through SMS. Members of groups contribute with their own thoughts and information by sending an SMS to 729, the Paywast short code.</p>\n\n<p>Paywast groups are an easy way for people to share information and communicate about what interests them â€“ studies, work, hobbies or family matters. Staying in touch with distant relatives across the country has never been easier â€“ families can stay connected through their own Paywast group.</p>\n\n<p>Paywast users can make groups private or public, depending on the purpose of the group. Public groups can be joined by anyone, whereas users joining a private group must be approved by the group owner before becoming a member of the group.</p>\n\n<p>Citizens are not the only ones who benefit from Paywast. Organizations, small businesses and public authorities can use Paywast as an efficient way to communicate with users and customers. Through Paywast Tip Lines, people can send anonymous tips and share knowledge with organizations in an easy manner. Organizations can in addition set up one-way groups, which allows sharing of information through SMS to anyone who signs up for the group. Members of one-way groups cannot share information with the rest of the group, but only with the owner of the group.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0013/7758/137758v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,101],"assets/images/resized/0013/7758/137758v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,163],"assets/images/resized/0013/7758/137758v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Kabul","state_code":null,"country_code":"AFG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
