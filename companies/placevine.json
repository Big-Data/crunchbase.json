The entire workflow of a brand integration transaction â€“ from discovery to evaluation, through negotiation and execution â€“ remains a completely manual process.  PlaceVine believes that every integration is unique and cannot be reduced to a &#8220;click-to-buy&#8221; transaction, but that technology can play a critical role in improving transparency in the industry. </p>\n\n<p>PlaceVine addresses these needs with powerful technology tools for the discovery and evaluation of integration opportunities. PlaceVine provides marketers and agencies with transparent access to brand integration opportunities in feature-length film, television and new media while enabling content creators to maximize the value of their brand integration inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The company was launched with the support of the Wharton Venture Award and is based in New York and Los Angeles. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/0249/30249v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[242,81],"assets/images/resized/0003/0249/30249v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[242,81],"assets/images/resized/0003/0249/30249v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"The Brand Integration Service","permalink":"the-brand-integration-service","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Neichin","permalink":"greg-neichin","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Thornton","permalink":"jon-thornton","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Erlebacher","permalink":"adam-erlebacher","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Brandon","last_name":"Berger","permalink":"brandon-berger","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-branded-content-matchmaker-placevine-gets-500k-seed-round/","source_description":"Branded Content Matchmaker PlaceVine Gets $500k Seed Round","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":25,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"NYC Seed","permalink":"nyc-seed","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/9886/19886v1-max-150x150.png"],[[226,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/9886/19886v1-max-250x250.png"],[[226,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/9886/19886v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":3,"acquired_day":null,"acquiring_company":{"name":"AlphaBird","permalink":"alphabird","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0007/9967/79967v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0007/9967/79967v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,361],"assets/images/resized/0007/9967/79967v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.756054,"longitude":-73.986951},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.052187,"longitude":-118.243425}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.tvweek.com/talking-tv/dealmakers/2008/11/adam_erlebacher_and_greg_neich.php","title":"TV Week, Digital Dealmakers"},{"external_url":"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/10/a-web-based-app.html","title":"LA Times"},{"external_url":"http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/esearch/e3ie08aadb553c2ade90e9898b1297b96dd","title":"AdWeek"}]}
