Do you hear a lot of stock talk but leery when the pros canâ€™t â€œshow you the moneyâ€? TickerTrekÂ® allows you to create your own virtual portfolio, develop a strategy for investing, and follow other users that arenâ€™t all talk (because you can actually track their performance).</p>\n\n<p>TickerTrekÂ®â€™s seamless interface allows you to monitor your virtual money in real time, search and filter within different markets for working strategies, and even compete with fellow strategists for monthly cash prices. If youâ€™re a more advanced investor, you can also sell access to your working strategies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0015/5666/155666v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/5666/155666v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,108],"assets/images/resized/0015/5666/155666v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
