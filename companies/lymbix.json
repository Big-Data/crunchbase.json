Their products measure the tone and emotional impact of words in everyday written language. </p>\n\n<p>The Lymbix technology delivers highly precise sentiment analysis and determines how words and phrases expressed in blogs, posts, email, or other social media make people feel (e.g. Angry).</p>\n\n<p>Current sentiment tools are limited to a simplistic scale of positive / neutral / negative.
