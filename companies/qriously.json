The Qriously SDK provides a means for the user to answer a question without having to &#8216;leave&#8217; the app, creating a more fluid user experience flow.</p>\n\n<p>This enables you to ask millions of people what they think about something, and track those responses in real-time, tagged to location.</p>\n\n<p>Qriously has a pay-per-answer business model. Revenue is shared with developers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0009/6564/96564v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,108],"assets/images/resized/0009/6564/96564v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,195],"assets/images/resized/0009/6564/96564v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Censio (Qriously Censio profiles app audiences)","permalink":"censio-qriously-censio-profiles-app-audiences","image":null},{"name":"Pulse measures real-time, location-based sentiment","permalink":"pulse-measures-real-time-location-based-sentiment","image":null},{"name":"Qriously Censio profiles app audiences","permalink":"qriously-censio-profiles-app-audiences","image":null},{"name":"Qriously Tactus is a mobile copy testing tool","permalink":"qriously-tactus-is-a-mobile-copy-testing-tool","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Kahler","permalink":"christopher-kahler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6563/96563v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6563/96563v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0009/6563/96563v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.6M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/07/qriously-raises-1-6m-to-let-brands-replace-mobile-ads-with-questions/","source_description":"Qriously Raises $1.6M To Let Brands Replace Mobile Ads With Questions","raised_amount":1600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":7,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Accel Partners","permalink":"accel-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,162],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Amalfi Capital","permalink":"amalfi-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0017/9821/179821v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0017/9821/179821v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[328,76],"assets/images/resized/0017/9821/179821v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Qriously won the STARTup Live Vienna #3.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":13,"source_url":"http://www.starteurope.at/2886/startup-live-vienna-3-roundup/","source_text":null,"source_description":"STARTup Live Vienna #3 winner","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Qriously","permalink":"qriously"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0012/5214/125214v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0012/5214/125214v2-max-250x250.png"],[[373,259],"assets/images/resized/0012/5214/125214v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
