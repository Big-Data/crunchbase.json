Without any web design experience or knowledge of coding, Webdoc allows you to mix different kinds of web content directly in your browser through a simple and intuitive interface. Simply drag-and-drop the web!</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a free canvas where you can mix any portion of web to not just express yourself in new creative ways, but amplify that message to your community, customers, partners, friends, fans and more. Webdoc lets you combine rich media, cool apps and your favorite web services like YouTube, Flickr, Slideshare, Twitter, Google Maps, Facebook, your blog and more to create interactive posts within minutes.</p>\n\n<p>With Webdoc, you can create, mix, share and embed your post anywhere your community, customers or friends spend time. In a few quick clicks, you can post your Webdoc creations on your website, Wordpress or Tumblr blog, Facebook page, and more. It&#8217;s as easy as embedding a YouTube code but instead of sharing one form of media (video), you can mix any form of media together in one central place and then share that &#8220;media mashup&#8221; anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Users range from consumers, bloggers and brand/social media marketers wanting to generate more awareness and traffic to Facebook and Twitter users, entertainers who want to share content and better engage with friends/fans, and small business owners who want to more effectively share promotions, discounts, contests and products.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0009/9474/99474v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0009/9474/99474v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,162],"assets/images/resized/0009/9474/99474v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Core Team","person":{"first_name":"Stelio","last_name":"Tzonis","permalink":"stelio-tzonis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Core Team","person":{"first_name":"Cyril","last_name":"Pavillard","permalink":"cyril-pavillard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Core Team","person":{"first_name":"Alexandre","last_name":"Tzonis","permalink":"alexandre-tzonis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Music ","person":{"first_name":"Olivier","last_name":"de Simone","permalink":"olivier-de-simone","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Core Team","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Borel","permalink":"vincent-borel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Core Team","person":{"first_name":"Mathieu","last_name":"Fivaz","permalink":"mathieu-fivaz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Front-End Web Developer","person":{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"Vuigner","permalink":"emmanuel-vuigner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1544/101544v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,178],"assets/images/resized/0010/1544/101544v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,178],"assets/images/resized/0010/1544/101544v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"Rue de Gen√®ve 17","address2":"","zip_code":"1003","city":"Lausanne","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
