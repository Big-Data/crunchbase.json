The OLIVE (On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment) software platform uses industry standard PC hardware and networks. Customers can rapidly deploy realistic, collaborative, 3D Internet solutions that scale from small group applications to large scale simulated environments supporting many hundreds of concurrent users. </p>\n\n<p>The OLIVE based virtual worlds have an experience close to a live, face-to-face meeting that is more engaging and immersive than audio and web conferencing yet still eliminates the need to travel. The software is used by leading companies like Thomson Reuters, Lockheed Martin, Accenture, and the US Army. Forterra Systems partners with IBM, Accenture, and Autodesk. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0004/9246/49246v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/9246/49246v1-max-250x250.png"],[[322,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/9246/49246v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/?p=108288","source_description":"Forterra raises $1.2M for corporate virtual worlds","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":8,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Jerusalem Venture Partners","permalink":"jerusalem-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8552/28552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[113,162],"assets/images/resized/0002/8552/28552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[113,162],"assets/images/resized/0002/8552/28552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sutter Hill Ventures","permalink":"sutter-hill-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0003/0838/30838v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/0838/30838v1-max-250x250.png"],[[432,41],"assets/images/resized/0003/0838/30838v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"In-Q-Tel","permalink":"in-q-tel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/9271/29271v1-max-150x150.png"],[[125,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/9271/29271v1-max-250x250.png"],[[125,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/9271/29271v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"2207 Bridgepointe Parkway, Suite 200","address2":"","zip_code":"94404","city":"San Mateo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.561576,"longitude":-122.284173}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
