Milk the Sun brings together all market participants – rooftop and open space owners, roof-agents, project developers, installation companies, insurers and investors alike. It is a pan-European online marketplace that allows buyers and sellers in PV industry to search, browse and connect with other PV market participants. Registered users can advertise their project offers and requests on a clear and standardised interface. Additionally, our platform integrates service providers in the area of photovoltaics. This allows for the first, transparent, Europe-wide trading of project rights (primary market) and installed solar systems (secondary market) - without long broker chains – and for the comparison of complementary service providers.</p>\n\n<p>Until today more than 200 projects have been added to the marketplace, over 6 MWp were successfully promoted and about 35 MWp (with the total investment volume accounting to € 70 million) are due diligence.
