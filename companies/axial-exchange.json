The company’s products, Axial Provider and Axial Patient, enable continuity of care across disparate settings. When a patient transitions between hospital and other care settings, information gaps can drive up avoidable readmission rates and patient safety issues. Axial enables information to flow to a patient’s next care setting so that providers have what they need, when they need it. In parallel, Axial engages patients with the information and tools needed to improve their ownership of after-care responsibilities. Axial’s SaaS technology platform is built on open infrastructure and is capable of managing virtually any type of health data and presenting it in a consumer-like experience that accommodates any device with a web browser. In December 2011 Axial’s care transition suite was named first-prize winner in the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Partnership for Patients Initiative innovation competition for “Ensuring Safe Transitions from Hospital to Home.”</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0019/5655/195655v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0019/5655/195655v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[269,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/5655/195655v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://mobihealthnews.com/17645/axial-acquires-mayo-clinic-mobile-health-startup-mremedy/","source_description":"Axial acquires Mayo Clinic mobile health startup mRemedy","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":6,"acquired_day":14,"company":{"name":"mRemedy","permalink":"mremedy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0019/5650/195650v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0019/5650/195650v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[341,92],"assets/images/resized/0019/5650/195650v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"510 Glenwood Avenue","address2":"Suite 215","zip_code":"27603","city":"Raleigh","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0019/5656/195656v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,184],"assets/images/resized/0019/5656/195656v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,331],"assets/images/resized/0019/5656/195656v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
