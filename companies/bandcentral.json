By centralising all aspects of a bands management activity, BandCentral encourages greater collaboration between the band, band manager and third parties (such as producers, promoters or roadies) and minimizes the effort required to complete day-to-day admin tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Built with Ruby on Rails with security, usability, stability and speed in mind, and sporting a slick, AJAX-driven interface, BandCentral enables bands and managers to harness the very best of existing and emerging web technology, giving them all the tools they need to manage themselves better online.</p>\n\n<p>Conceived, designed and built by practising musicians, BandCentral centralises the band&#8217;s activity, avoiding loss of important information and needless repetition. It streamlines the self-management process and removes the headache from everyday communication between band mates, their management, 3rd parties (such as producers/promoters/roadies) and their fans.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the tour at: www.bandcentral.com/tour</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0005/3172/53172v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/3172/53172v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/3172/53172v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Wil","last_name":"Padley","permalink":"wil-padley","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development Director","person":{"first_name":"Belle","last_name":"Crocker","permalink":"belle-crocker","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"71 Broadwick St","address2":"","zip_code":"W1F 9QY","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5134198,"longitude":-0.136414}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-DacFwHZKwY&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-DacFwHZKwY&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/3168/53168v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0005/3168/53168v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,309],"assets/images/resized/0005/3168/53168v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/3169/53169v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0005/3169/53169v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,309],"assets/images/resized/0005/3169/53169v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/3170/53170v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0005/3170/53170v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,309],"assets/images/resized/0005/3170/53170v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/3171/53171v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0005/3171/53171v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,309],"assets/images/resized/0005/3171/53171v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2009/07/14/bandcentral/","title":"Mashable feature BandCentral in their Spark of Genius series "},{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/bandcentral/the_online_band_manager/prweb2599154.htm","title":"BandCentral launch release"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/bandcentral-com-mange-your-band-online","title":"Killer Startups feature BandCentral"},{"external_url":"http://bandcentral.com/tour","title":"BandCentral Tour"},{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/BandCentral/Midem/prweb3354264.htm","title":"Midem 2010 BandCentral to showcase in the MidemNet Lab"},{"external_url":"http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=126372","title":"Eurosonic Nomination for BandCentral"},{"external_url":"http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3iab94f6e82ce3eec111e32b08bdaf565b","title":"Billboard feature BandCentral"}]}
