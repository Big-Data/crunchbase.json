The world is based around characters users create called pets. Users must keep their pets healthy, fed and in good spirits.</p>\n\n<p>With your pet, you can explore the Neopets world, engage in solo quests or play solo games for rewards, complete missions with other players and meet other characters. Neopets has plenty of places to visit including the Battledome, the undersea city of Maraqua, the Lost Desert or the Virtupets Space Station.</p>\n\n<p>When users complete missions or quests they receive items like Dark Reflectorbs or Neopets money called Neopoints.  Pets can visit the Neopian Bazaar or the Neopian Plaza to trade, buy and sell items. Users can also invest in the Neopian stock market. </p>\n\n<p>Neopets is free to play but they also have a subscription version called Neopets Premium that has better features and benefits.
