Cost-free and easy to use, this is the next generation of the old-fashioned Lemonade Stand concept.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade stands are free to set up and can be created in under three minutes, either by visiting www.lemonade.com or by adding Lemonade as a widget/application on Facebook, Blogger, and other key distribution points. The company has a multi-revenue generating model that allows users to earn money from product promotions, recommendations, and sales. </p>\n\n<p>Stand owners are not required to hold any inventory, ship items, deal with returns or receive payment for the products that they recommend. All of the transactions take place at the retailer&#8217;s e-commerce site.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade has access to 2,500 retailers and advertisers through back-end partnerships with companies such as Apple (iTunes &amp; Mac), Netflix, TigerDirect Electronics, The Sharper Image, Macyâ€™s, Nordstrom, MovieLink and Wal-Mart.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade was named the #1 Website of 2007 by TIME Magazine and CNN.com. It was also selected by NBC&#8217;s Today Show as one of &#8220;Five Websites to Change Your Life.&#8221; This is documented at http://www.lemonade.com/about/press.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonadeâ€™s primary market is the 18-25 year old â€œsocial animal,â€ which includes males and females who are heavily engaged in social networking. The primary market also includes retailers/direct marketers in a variety of industries that sell to this market. The secondary market is the 25-45 year old â€œsuper momâ€ who uses Lemonade to earn extra spending money. Oftentimes this woman has expertise in a particular subject and is sought out by friends and colleagues for advice.  For example, this is could include the â€œdigital camera expertâ€ or the woman who always knows what face cream to buy or which car seat is the best.  Friends want to repay this expert for the advice they give but do not have a mechanism to do so.  The secondary market also includes advertisers trying to reach the 25-45 year old super mom.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0001/7570/17570v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[197,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/7570/17570v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[197,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/7570/17570v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor, Advisor","person":{"first_name":"GM","last_name":"O'Connell","permalink":"gm-oconnell","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Zlio","permalink":"zlio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0000/2248/2248v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/2248/2248v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/2248/2248v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MyPickList","permalink":"mypicklist","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/9350/19350v1-max-150x150.png"],[[192,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/9350/19350v1-max-250x250.png"],[[192,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/9350/19350v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ShopIt","permalink":"shopit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/0540/20540v1-max-150x150.png"],[[168,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/0540/20540v1-max-250x250.png"],[[168,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/0540/20540v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"nooked","permalink":"nooked","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0002/4562/24562v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/4562/24562v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[191,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/4562/24562v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"P.O.
