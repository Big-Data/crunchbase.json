BERC also qualifies under HUD and EDA regulations to receive funding as a local development corporation. It is a membership corporation that meets SBA requirements. BERC was modeled after the Philadelphia (PA) Industrial Development Council (PIDC). BERC&#8217;s semi-independent operation is representative of most urban economic development corporations nationally. Unlike many of its counterparts in other medium-sized U.S. cities, BERC is a comprehensive, effective and successful economic development corporation. It successfully places a high priority on creating jobs, recruits and maintains excellent and aggressive staff, and enjoys a close working relationship with the City of Buffalo, the ECIDA, New York State, the federal government and area banks.</p>\n\n<p>BERC offers several incubator locations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Beverly A Gray Business Services Incubator</li>\n<li>Buffalo Free Trade Complex (BFTC)</li>\n<li>Can-Am Building</li>\n<li>Market Arcade Complex</li>\n<li>River Rock Industrial Incubator</li>\n<li>William Gaiter Parkway</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0009/7558/97558v2-max-150x150.png"],[[170,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7558/97558v2-max-250x250.png"],[[170,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7558/97558v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"920 City Hall","address2":"","zip_code":"14202","city":"Buffalo","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
