No tech skills, no coding, just a creative mind and an interesting subject.</p>\n\n<p>There are literally millions of websites that have been created before mobile devices kicked in. That means a transition is due on a global scale. </p>\n\n<p>Now there are 2 ways to go about it.</p>\n\n<p>Try to squeeze a current website into tablet/smartphone format. This will eliminate both readability and usability.</p>\n\n<p>Pay a webdesign company a large sum of money to build a new website. This could have an impact on the companies cashflow, especially for small home business owners.</p>\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t read websites, they scan them, even more now that over 50% browse the web on a mobile device like a tablet or a smartphone. Forget about 4 columns website, with 16 pages etc. Times have changed dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>This is where Socialgimme can make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Determine unique sellings points, and create a Gimme page. Effortlessly add articles, images, video&#8217;s, banners, Social feeds, contact-forms, adsense and more at lightning speed, and single click enabled.</p>\n\n<p>If someone wants to take it a step further, they can have all their Gimmes show up on their wall, herewith building an engaging relationship with subscribers to that wall, and monetize them.</p>\n\n<p>Example of a Gimme wall: http://movie.socialgimme.com</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, Socialgimme is there for everyone, whether it&#8217;s a large company, a small home business owner, of just any individual who wants to express themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The future of webdesign is here, it&#8217;s called Socialgimme.
