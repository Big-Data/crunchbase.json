","created_at":"Tue Mar 20 16:52:58 UTC 2012","updated_at":"Sun Nov 25 20:25:17 UTC 2012","overview":"<p>Spently makes it easy for merchants to send beautiful and effective email receipts that increase customer engagement and drive sales. </p>\n\n<p>Spently’s web-based software helps merchants plan, create, and deliver content to individual customers. Using new online transactional touchpoints, such as receipts, or order confirmation emails, Spently is re-inventing the receipt in ways no one has done before. An email receipt can now be used to deliver promotional messages, logos, disclaimers, and geographic-based information, all while providing new insights to merchants. </p>\n\n<p>Spently’s electronic receipts have proven to be a key feature that complements the evolving e-commerce and point-of-sale markets by adding a highly effective and newly discovered opportunity for email marketing and customer intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>Spently was founded in 2011 when founders submitted their business plan to a college-wide competition and won, becoming recipients of the Humber Venture Fund. Since then, the company has gone on to raise additional funding, assemble a great team, launch a product, and take on initial customers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,45],"assets/images/resized/0018/1153/181153v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[118,45],"assets/images/resized/0018/1153/181153v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[118,45],"assets/images/resized/0018/1153/181153v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Panepinto","permalink":"vincent-panepinto","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Wiktorczyk","permalink":"nicholas-wiktorczyk","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Developer","person":{"first_name":"Barranger","last_name":"Ridler","permalink":"barranger-ridler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Arteaga","permalink":"mark-arteaga","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Marketing","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Famous Folks","permalink":"famous-folks","image":null}},{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt","permalink":"osler-hoskin-harcourt","image":null}},{"title":"Sales","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Venture Accelerator Partners","permalink":"venture-accelerator-partners","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"C$138k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":8000,"raised_currency_code":"CAD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"CAD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"CAD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":26,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"CSI Annex","address1":"720 Bathurst St. ","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Toronto","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjz8lbsU21A","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/news.asp?id=65468","title":"Spently to offer free cloud-based digital receipts service"}]}
