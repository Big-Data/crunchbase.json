With so many different calendar formats and platforms, sharing a calendar online can be a dizzying mess that will confuse almost anyone. We created Eventable to simplify this process so anyone can easily upload/link their calendars and place a calendar follow button on their website. From there, viewers will be able to easily follow those events in their personal calendars.</p>\n\n<p>Our main focus has always been on simplicity and ease of useâ€”anyone, regardless of technical background, should be able to link their calendars with Eventable and place a follow button on their site. Our goal is to make the process of sharing and subscribing to calendars as easy and simple as possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0018/5458/185458v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/5458/185458v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/5458/185458v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Alpha Launch of Eventable","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://blog.intimelabs.com/post/28408681509/announcing-the-alpha-launch-of-eventable","source_text":null,"source_description":"Announcing the Alpha Launch of Eventable","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"inTime Labs","permalink":"intime-labs"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,119],"assets/images/resized/0020/5373/205373v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,199],"assets/images/resized/0020/5373/205373v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,358],"assets/images/resized/0020/5373/205373v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
