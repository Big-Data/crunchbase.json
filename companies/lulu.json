(Map) -  RALEIGH, N.C., July 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Lulu.com, the premier site for digital content on the Internet, is partnering with Scribd, the leading platform for online document sharing and publishing, to test iPaper, Scribd's document viewer built for the Web. Lulu.com users will test iPaper on select content for a three month period beginning in July.\r\n\r\niPaper is the first full-featured viewer that lets users view any type of document directly in their web browser, serving as an Internet alternative to a PDF. There is no software to download, allowing users to publish and view documents more quickly while retaining the popular features of a PDF, such as full text search within documents. iPaper also allows documents to be easily indexed by search engine crawlers.\r\n\r\n\"Lulu has always been on the leading edge of new functionality that provides the best user experience to be able to manage and distribute their content online,\" said Bryce Boothby, President and COO of Lulu Enterprises. \"We think that working with Scribd and looking at ways iPaper can help us to further empower creators, in addition to the tools that Lulu already provides, will be great for Lulu users.\"\r\n\r\nScribd (www.scribd.com) offers a set of tools that allows anyone to use iPaper on their own website. Now iPaper offers new distribution options for Lulu creators, including one-click emailing documents, embedding documents simply on any websites or blogs, and various networking features, like the ability to share documents with friends.\r\n\r\n\"Scribd and Lulu have both been pioneers in the online publishing market, pushing the boundaries beyond traditional media distribution tactics,\" said Trip Adler, Scribd's CEO and Co-founder. \"Integrating iPaper into Lulu is a great next step for both companies, and Scribd is proud to offer new options to Lulu and its authors.\"\r\n\r\nLulu.com will include a broad sampling of some of its most popular free content in the test. Select titles will be from a variety of genres, including cookbooks; biographies and memoirs; photo books; computer and Internet; and arts and photography. At the conclusion of the test period, Lulu and Scribd will explore rolling out iPaper to include more content on Lulu.com.\r\n\r\nAbout Lulu (www.lulu.com): Lulu.com is the premier marketplace for digital content on the Internet, with over 400,000 recently published titles, and more than 5,000 new titles added each week, created by people in 80 different countries. With just over 1.3 million registered members, Lulu is changing the world of publishing by enabling the creators to publish their work themselves with complete editorial and copyright control. With storefronts provided and other marketing support, Lulu creators are fully empowered to profit from their work.\r\n\r\nAbout Scribd (www.scribd.com): Scribd is the leader in online document sharing and publishing. It was founded in 2006 by then-Harvard students Trip Adler and Jared Friedman, and their friend Tikhon Bernstam, when they couldn't find a way to publish the documents they wrote for school on the Web. Scribd has since grown to service nearly 20 million unique visitors per month and has the largest document-sharing community on the Internet. Documents hosted on the site are being viewed and embedded across the Internet in every corner of the globe. Scribd is funded by Y Combinator, The Kinsey Hills Group and Redpoint Ventures.","source_description":"Lulu.com Teams up with Scribd to Offer Most Popular Free Content via iPaper ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Lulu","permalink":"lulu"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0004/4805/44805v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0004/4805/44805v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0004/4805/44805v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
