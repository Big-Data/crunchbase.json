In fact BackgroundChecksWikiâ„¢ is the child of a few parents including Quest Research Ltd, IntegraScreen Ltd and Dataflow Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade that the management team has been involved in background checks it has become more and more apparent that the vast majority of companies (outside of the US) do not conduct thorough background checks. In fact many do none at all. The main reason we hear is that they are too expensive and too time consuming.</p>\n\n<p>Government departments are equally unaware of what can be done when it comes to effective checks on visa applicants and professional licensing checks on foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this Wiki is to make everyone aware of the resources that are available and that effective background checks can be done nearly anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p>If we are successful in getting this message across it is our belief that the 95+% of major companies that are not running systematic international programs will start to do so, benefiting their company with a higher calibre of recruit as well as the industry with a greatly increased customer base.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0012/8222/128222v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0012/8222/128222v2-max-250x250.png"],[[378,43],"assets/images/resized/0012/8222/128222v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"80 Marine Parade Road, #09-01, Parkway Parade","address2":"","zip_code":"449269","city":"Singapore","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"349\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/koPFCzsvB6A?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/koPFCzsvB6A?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Overview for Public - BackgroundChecksWiki.com</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
