Launched in November 2006, the service has over 27 million registered users. It is owned by Forticom (70%) and polish Nasza-Klasa Sp.z.o.o. (30%), the founding company of Nasza-Klasa. The site is similar in concept to the American-based Classmates.com, allowing its users to register from particular schools and graduation years. The users are able to keep and maintain a personal page containing information such as their name, age, photos, interests and the history of schools and classes attended. Nasza-klasa doesn&#8217;t require an invitation to join, however registration is necessary to browse the service. The leader of the project is Maciej Popowicz from WrocÅ‚aw. Nasza Klasa is compared to services such as Facebook or MyYearbook.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/7483/107483v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,79],"assets/images/resized/0010/7483/107483v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,79],"assets/images/resized/0010/7483/107483v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0019/7558/197558v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0019/7558/197558v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,355],"assets/images/resized/0019/7558/197558v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
