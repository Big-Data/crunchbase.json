These well-specific tracers can be added to hydraulic fracturing (&#8220;fracking&#8221; or “fracing”) fluid, which is used for shale gas extraction. SafeTNA’s quick and simple analysis can be used to determine whether hydraulic fracturing fluid has migrated into drinking water and help resolve liability concerns. SafeTNA provides a suite of services for gas producers that are useful tools for problem detection, limiting liability, and increasing accountability with communities concerned with protecting their water.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"Chow","permalink":"justine-chow","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Rigel","permalink":"adam-rigel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jake","last_name":"Rudulph","permalink":"jake-rudulph","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Paul-Harvey","last_name":"Weiner","permalink":"paul-harvey-weiner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Counsel ","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Roche","permalink":"david-roche","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Research Triangle Office","address1":"SafeTNA","address2":"2 Davis Drive","zip_code":"27709","city":"RTP","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.safetna.com","title":"SafeTNA"}]}
