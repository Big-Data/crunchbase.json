Users can then share those plans with friends on the UPlanMe platform or invite friends to join-in with them.</p>\n\n<p>Users can also create their own public or private groups and allow others to &#8220;unlock&#8221; or opt-in to that group.  The user can then create group events that are automatically placed on the calendars of those who have opted-in.</p>\n\n<p>Businesses and brands can also take ownership of their public pages through UPlanMe to place their specials and events directly onto the calendars of users who have &#8220;unlocked&#8221; or opted-in to their business.</p>\n\n<p>UPlanMe&#8217;s tagline: Stop Planning.
