This is probably the most cost effective way to go, but not everyone has the time or skill required to complete the job.</li>\n<li>Contract a private individual who is experienced in the skill they require. This is the best option! The consumers are now renting the skill directly from the person that owns it, and it is far cheaper since there is no business/company profits involved.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The only problem with the last option was that no-one knew where to find these skilled individualsâ€¦ Until now!</p>\n\n<p>Jannie is launching a website that puts the consumer in direct contact with the skilled individual. The consumer simply does a free search on the Rentaskilldirect.com database for any skill or service they require in their area. They will then be supplied with a list of individuals advertising their experience, references and all relevant information making it easy for them to make a choice. The consumer will be supplied with the skilled individualâ€™s direct contact details and searching or advertising on the Website is FREE!</p>\n\n<p>The website also offers a reference system. The consumers are encouraged to go back onto the website and enter a reference for the person whose skill they rented. All references are available to view. The reference system informs consumers of good or bad service provided by the Skilled individual and so keeps an element of trust in place.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone with a skill is welcome to join FREE. Their skills and all their other relevant information will be advertised worldwide. </p>\n\n<p>Another special feature is the Support groups offered by the website. Joining the website gives the skilled individual access to a support group in their field. If they are plumber they would belong to the Plumbers group for instance. Electricians will belong to the Electricians group and so forth. In these groups they can discuss new technologies and get help and advice or just chat socially with other people with the same skill and interests. This function makes the skilled individuals feel like they are part of something and keeps them actively involved in their skill.  </p>\n\n<p>Skills development has always been a problem around the world. If an individual does not own a skill they can join the skills development program for free where they sign up as an apprentice. They can then search the Rentaskilldirect database for an individual who is experienced in the skill that they want to master and who resides in their area. They can then request a mentorship from that person. If the skilled individual accepts, they will then mentor the apprentice and teach them everything about their skill. In exchange the apprentice could possibly work for the mentor at no charge or the mentor may decide to remunerate the apprentice for their help. </p>\n\n<p>The website has special tools - an online diary, email, quote generator, invoice generator, receipt generator and all other templates a skilled individual would require when renting out their skills. We also supply them with free business cards and their unique web address (URL).  Rentaskilldirect is the perfect tool for private skilled individuals renting out their skills. They can manage all their clients and contacts and never lose that important clientâ€™s contact details. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/4625/24625v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/4625/24625v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/4625/24625v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Office","address1":"39 Malcolm Road","address2":"Rondebosch","zip_code":"7700","city":"Cape Town","state_code":null,"country_code":"ZAF","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
