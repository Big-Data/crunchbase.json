The game can now be aware of the player&#8217;s involvement, and adjust itself accordingly. For example, experienced players will no longer get bored while waiting for advanced levels, the game will adjust its complexity until it feels that the player is adequately excited.</p>\n\n<p>Our system can also detect emotions while watching a movie or a commercial, and send the info to the media-center. </p>\n\n<p>We have already presented our prototype to several market leaders and gaming companies and got high interest and great feedback.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0015/6946/156946v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0015/6946/156946v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,319],"assets/images/resized/0015/6946/156946v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eyal","last_name":"Arad","permalink":"eyal-arad","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Kahana","permalink":"david-kahana","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Tzah","last_name":"Bakal","permalink":"tzah-bakal","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"BD","person":{"first_name":"Maor","last_name":"Moti","permalink":"maor-moti","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"25 Arlozorov Ave.","address2":"","zip_code":"18126","city":"Afula","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
