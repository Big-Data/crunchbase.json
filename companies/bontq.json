One option for companies in that situation could be to use an online service for tracking bugs. One online service stands out with a few extra features that make it quite useful for those tracking the bugs and those reporting the bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Bontq is an online solution that does both bug tracking as well as project management. But Bontq doesnâ€™t stop there. This online solution also offers a client application that helps users easily snap and submit screenshots to aid in the bug tracking process.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/6416/186416v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/6416/186416v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/6416/186416v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"BontQ","permalink":"bontq","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Jira","permalink":"jira","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Fog Creek Software","permalink":"fog-creek-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/1729/21729v1-max-150x150.png"],[[143,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/1729/21729v1-max-250x250.png"],[[143,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/1729/21729v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Assembla","permalink":"assembla","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/5158/35158v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/5158/35158v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/5158/35158v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1151 Yates Way","address2":"","zip_code":"94403","city":"San Mateo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/40245159\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/40245159\">BontQ - Make your Software Close to Perfection.</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user11252975\">Bontq</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Introduction Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0018/6413/186413v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,180],"assets/images/resized/0018/6413/186413v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,325],"assets/images/resized/0018/6413/186413v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0018/6414/186414v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,162],"assets/images/resized/0018/6414/186414v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,291],"assets/images/resized/0018/6414/186414v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0018/6415/186415v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0018/6415/186415v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0018/6415/186415v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
