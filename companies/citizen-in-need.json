Pet food, transportation and taxable groceries are just some of the grants we have to offer. </p>\n\n<p>Tell us your situation, fill out our application and we will try our best to customize a grant for your need. We are currently running a waiting list for those who wish to make a donation. We will contact you once our almost completed process of becoming a non taxable and non profit group is finished.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0010/9412/109412v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0010/9412/109412v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0010/9412/109412v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Rocco","permalink":"anthony-rocco","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Website Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Google","permalink":"google-4","image":null}},{"title":"Beneficiary For Donations","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"PetSmart","permalink":"petsmart","image":null}},{"title":"Web Hosting","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Dulcimer Designs","permalink":"dulcimer-designs","image":null}},{"title":"Advertising","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Google Adsense","permalink":"google-adsense","image":null}},{"title":"Website Visitor Information","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Google Analytics","permalink":"google-analytics-2","image":null}},{"title":"Adding Plugin Applications","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Google App Engine","permalink":"google-app-engine-2","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Mailing Address","address1":"PO BOX 355","address2":"","zip_code":"10709","city":"Eastchester","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"https://docs.google.com/a/citizeninneed.org/document/pub?id=1mkGub6dLvP9l2nH9uJEd1bYErOSTwVtE0M2lkPb5l8U","title":"MyObama.org Accepts Citizen In Need onto Website"}]}
