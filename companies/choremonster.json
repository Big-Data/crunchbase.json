As your child completes chores, they gain points which can be turned in for real life rewards such as an hour of xbox, a tv show or even a canoe trip. Kids also get to collect monsters while doing their chores, which the can play games with and learn from. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0016/8988/168988v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0016/8988/168988v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,347],"assets/images/resized/0016/8988/168988v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Bergman","permalink":"chris-bergman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CCO","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Armstrong","permalink":"paul-armstrong","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Pfefferle","permalink":"kevin-pfefferle","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"HighScore House","permalink":"highscore-house","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/8080/128080v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0012/8080/128080v2-max-250x250.png"],[[388,260],"assets/images/resized/0012/8080/128080v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$375k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://cincytechusa.com/2012/01/recent-brandery-graduate-receives-funding/","source_description":"RECENT BRANDERY GRADUATE RECEIVES FUNDING","raised_amount":350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":5,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Cincytech","permalink":"cincytech","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://brandery.org/2011/07/new-space-and-a-new-class/","source_description":"The Brandery Announces 2011 Class","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The Brandery","permalink":"the-brandery","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0016/6437/166437v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0016/6437/166437v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0016/6437/166437v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"1401 Central Pkwy","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"45202","city":"Cincinnati","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,109],"assets/images/resized/0016/8986/168986v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,182],"assets/images/resized/0016/8986/168986v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,329],"assets/images/resized/0016/8986/168986v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0016/8987/168987v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,179],"assets/images/resized/0016/8987/168987v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,323],"assets/images/resized/0016/8987/168987v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://brandery.org/2011/09/startup-interview-choremonster/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://techcocktail.com/8-startups-cincinnati-the-brandery-accelerator-2011-10#.TwX5giOXRih","title":""}]}
