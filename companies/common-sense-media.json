As a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization, we provide trustworthy information and tools, as well as an independent forum, so that families can have a choice and a voice about the media they consume.</p>\n\n<p>Ten Common Sense Beliefs</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We believe in media sanity, not censorship.</li>\n<li>We believe that media has truly become &#8220;the other parent&#8221; in our kids&#8217; lives, powerfully affecting their mental, physical, and social development.</li>\n<li>We believe in teaching our kids to be savvy, respectful and responsible media interpreters, creators, and communicators.  We canâ€™t cover their eyes but we can teach them to see.</li>\n<li>We believe parents should have a choice and a voice about the media our kids consume and create. Every family is different but all need information.</li>\n<li>We believe that the price for free and open media is a bit of extra homework for families. Parents need to know about the media their kids use and need to teach responsible, ethical behavior as well as manage overall media use.</li>\n<li>We believe that through informed decision making, we can improve the media landscape one decision at a time.</li>\n<li>We believe appropriate regulations about right time, right place, and right manner exist. They need to be upheld by our elected and appointed leaders.</li>\n<li>We believe in age-appropriate media and that the media industry needs to act responsibly as it creates and markets content for each audience.</li>\n<li>We believe ratings systems should be independent and transparent for all media.</li>\n<li>We believe in diversity of programming and media ownership.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0011/3305/113305v2-max-150x150.png"],[[162,48],"assets/images/resized/0011/3305/113305v2-max-250x250.png"],[[162,48],"assets/images/resized/0011/3305/113305v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Steyer","permalink":"jim-steyer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/9940/189940v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/9940/189940v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,280],"assets/images/resized/0018/9940/189940v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Weitzman","permalink":"jeff-weitzman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/7656/87656v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/7656/87656v2-max-250x250.png"],[[320,320],"assets/images/resized/0008/7656/87656v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"650 Townsend St, Suite 375","address2":"","zip_code":"94103","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
