We like to work with smart clients, and clever consultants on interesting projects. </p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve done work for oil and gas, retail, cable, telecommunications, and construction. Our home base is Calgary, Alberta Canada, but we love to travel. </p>\n\n<p>Where we started\nAfter 12 years, we know how the consulting and recruiting business works - and we want to change it. We know that the recruiting and consulting business hasn&#8217;t evolved in a very, very long time, and should be as up to date as the rest of the IT industry. The model that worked 15 years ago doesn&#8217;t fit well today.</p>\n\n<p>We work most often by referral. The consultants we work with are our peers, and part of our community - we work with them because we know them, their reputation, and the quality of their work.\nHow we&#8217;re different</p>\n\n<p>As.so.ci.a.tion is built on a number of core beliefs, values, and understandings.</p>\n\n<pre><code>* We believe relationships are the heart of our business, and our brand.\n* We value transparency in all our dealings. That includes margins, the negotiation process, and contract terms.\n* We believe that trust and loyalty is earned, and has immense value. That&amp;amp;#8217;s why we don&amp;amp;#8217;t use non-competes to keep consultants. Our people choose to work with us whenever they can.\n* We actively participate in community building, social media, and the open exchange of ideas and information. We attend and present at local and national events - regularly.\n* We understand that communication is a two-way process, and that listening comes first. Your team has unique needs, and we want to understand what they are.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how we put these beliefs into practice, everyday, and how it can help you find your next contract or consultant.\nWe&#8217;re the real deal\nWe&#8217;re actual, real, genuine, dyed-in-the-wool techies - we love to make stuff with code and we&#8217;re passionate about technology. </p>\n\n<p>If You need some help\nWe&#8217;d love to hear about your company, team, or dream product. Maybe we can build you something amazing, or help you find the perfect person to help you out.
