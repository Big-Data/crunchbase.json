These beacons can be followed so users know the latest about the places they love.  Anywhere a Radius user goes, they can pull out their phone and see the content most relevant to them based on their location, social network, interests, and the beacons they have previously found relevant. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0021/2091/212091v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0021/2091/212091v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0021/2091/212091v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Buisness Lead/Dev","person":{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"Ehrsam","permalink":"fred-ehrsam","image":{"available_sizes":[[[74,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/0901/210901v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[124,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/0901/210901v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[224,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/0901/210901v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94087","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
