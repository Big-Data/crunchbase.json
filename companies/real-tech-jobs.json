The primary goal for the service is to weed out the â€œfluffâ€ on both sides of the equation â€“ no â€œbuild me Facebook for $20â€ listings for providers to wade through, no l33t-speaking kids with impossible claims of talent for employers to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>For employers, the â€œexpensive for a freelance job listing, double it for a full-time positionâ€ model of pricing is out.  Jobs are broken into two tiers; Tier I job listings cost $75, Tier II listings cost $150, and all listings run for 30 days.  Tier I covers freelance contracts between $1000 and $5000 USD or full-time positions between $50,000 and $75,000 per year.  Tier II covers budgets of $5000 or more for freelance contracts and $75,000 or more per year for full-time positions, and Tier II listings are available exclusively to pre-screened, premium-member providers.  All listings are published to the website (including RSS feeds), Facebook, and Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>For providers, basic membership and access to Tier I listings (after a 5-day premium-member only period) is free.  Providers (like employers) can develop full profiles, including a general â€œAbout Meâ€ section, specific skills, and links to existing portfolios and social network profiles.</p>\n\n<p>Any member of Real Tech Jobs may review any other member.  We do not have a &#8220;rating&#8221; system, but rather a simple &#8220;positive&#8221; or &#8220;negative&#8221; experience option when reviewing members.  Any member who has at least five reviews and falls below a 50% positive review margin will be investigated for removal from the site, as we aim to support only the highest-quality technical employers and providers (note: all parties involved when investigating a user for removal will have the opportunity to provide input to assist the decision making process).</p>\n\n<p>Premium membership is available to every user.  Employers gain access to the member directory and the ability to contact potential hires directly with no need for a listing purchase (providers may opt out of being contacted).  Providers gain exclusive access to Tier II listings, access to Tier I listings during the first 5 days of availability, and the ability to create free â€œsubcontractorâ€ listings for jobs they want to share.  Providers must submit references and portfolio information that the staff of Real Tech Jobs will verify in order to be approved.  The fee for premium membership is $25 for 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to Real Tech Jobs&#8217; own listings, the staff will hand-pick jobs from other services and aggregators around the web, providing as many opportunities for good work as possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0007/3567/73567v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0007/3567/73567v2-max-250x250.png"],[[350,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/3567/73567v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Developer","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Fitzhugh DeLancey","permalink":"john-fitzhugh-delancey","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and System Analyst","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Morris DeLancey","permalink":"john-morris-delancey","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Simply Hired","permalink":"simply-hired","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/3571/3571v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0000/3571/3571v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[302,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/3571/3571v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Elance","permalink":"elance","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Guru","permalink":"guru","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0007/3985/73985v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,236],"assets/images/resized/0007/3985/73985v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,426],"assets/images/resized/0007/3985/73985v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0007/3986/73986v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,236],"assets/images/resized/0007/3986/73986v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,426],"assets/images/resized/0007/3986/73986v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
