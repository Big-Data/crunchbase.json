In our research we identified that consumers wanted a game that gave much more instant gratification. This led us to devise a game that would allow players to draft, play and win within a single day. Users pay entry fees to compete at a game of skill and the opportunity to win a cash prize. Entry fees start at $1 and go up to $535.</p>\n\n<p>FanDuel is led by Nigel Eccles who formerly launched the Flutter.com betting exchange (acquired by Betfair) and also re-launched the Betdaq betting exchange. Additionally he spent 4 years with McKinsey &amp; Co. The company currently has 30 employees and is headquartered in New York along with offices in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0010/8342/108342v1-max-150x150.png"],[[193,46],"assets/images/resized/0010/8342/108342v1-max-250x250.png"],[[193,46],"assets/images/resized/0010/8342/108342v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman
