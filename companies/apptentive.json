Since that time, the team has grown, adding design and Android expertise and fleshing out capabilities that have measurably improved the ratings and reviews for apps using the service while creating one-to-one customer relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Basic integration takes less than 15 minutes and client-side SDKs are currently available for iOS, Android and Mac OS X. Apptentive&#8217;s customers range from independent one-person development teams to large, multinational Internet brands with huge app install footprints. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Wooster","permalink":"andrew-wooster","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Robi","last_name":"Ganguly","permalink":"robi-ganguly","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO and co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Saffitz","permalink":"mike-saffitz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Sky","last_name":"Kelsey","permalink":"sky-kelsey","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://gigaom.com/2011/07/19/mobile-devs-re-emphasize-app-ratings-to-goose-downloads/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://katemats.com/2012/03/23/20-things-every-ios-and-mobile-dev-should-consider-in-their-app-promotion-strategy/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.geekwire.com/2011/eleven-startup-pitches-eleven-minutes-favorite/","title":""}]}
