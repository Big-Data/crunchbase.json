By providing a generic tool that can be tailored to any need, Canvas can be used by any non-software developer to allow users to go wireless, go green, go Canvas in minutes. </p>\n\n<p>Canvas realizes that the unique features of todayâ€™s handsets can allow new data â€œtypesâ€ to be captured.  These include image, video and voice capture, GPS/Location Based Data, barcode scanning and time date stamps.  When combined with the common data forms or surveys that users have mobilized, a new range of analysis and insight is now possible.  </p>\n\n<p>All of this for less than the cost of the paper it is
