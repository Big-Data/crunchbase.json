And no, we&#8217;re not another one of those â€œSEO expertsâ€ who use some kind of voodoo to try to get your website ranked high in Google. </p>\n\n<p>We are an online marketing agency; Iâ€™m interested in working with business owners who see whatâ€™s going on out there and know they have some catching up to do. For me, itâ€™s not just about search rankings; itâ€™s about results (your bottom line), your reputation, and your relationships. </p>\n\n<p>The Internet has changed everything for local businesses. How? Your customers and prospects now use it for just about everything. Check out these facts: </p>\n\n<p>â€¢â€ƒ97% of all consumers now use the Internet when researching products or \nservices in their local area.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢â€ƒ55% of all local searches are done with intent to buy.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢â€ƒEight out of ten consumers who research online call or visit a storeâ€”and 60% of \nthose consumers end up buying.</p>\n\n<p>The first step for most local businesses is to get out there and get found. But how do you know which online locations are the most important?</p>\n\n<p>We would like to give you information on how you can help your business answer this questionâ€”a free white paper and a video you can watch right now (itâ€™s only 5 minutes long). It shows you the most important locations, how you can get into them quickly, and how you can use them to build your businessâ€™ online reputation, AND your bottom-line.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Troy","last_name":"Glancy","permalink":"troy-glancy","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Office","address1":"1108 Madison Plaza","address2":"Suite 203","zip_code":"23320","city":"Chesapeake","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
