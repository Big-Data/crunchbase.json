The company has remained committed to their clients and to the areas that they serve through the ups and downs experienced by the financial markets during the late 1980’s and the recent recession. It is their dedication to London property and belief in the long lasting investment potential of prime residential property that has led to the growth and success of Aston Chase.\nToday Mark Pollack and Richard Bernstone continue to work within the company and are hands-on with every project and client. Mark is responsible for all residential sales and marketing while Richard heads up the division in charge of flat sales and residential investments. Aston Chase has two busy offices: Hampstead Garden Suburb and Regent’s Park and each office focus their skills and experience on specific areas to ensure that clients receive the best attention from true experts in their area. Aston Chase serves the areas of St. John’s Wood, Regent’s Park, Maida Vale, Hampstead, Primrose Hill and the Highgate areas. From a small partnership to a premier real estate agency with over 15 employees, both Mark and Richard advocate leadership development and mentoring their employees to be the very best and deliver their very best to their clients at all times.\nAston Chase offers a number of services to their clients ranging from sales and acquisitions, to rental services and rental management through to investment planning and advice for international clients looking to purchase property in specific prime areas in London. The company does not promote the use of excessive advertising and marketing due to the need for privacy demanded by their clients. Every project managed by Aston Chase is completely private and discretion has been the cornerstone of the company’s success over the past 25 years.\nWith much international interest in London properties over the past decade, Aston Chase has moved into the niche of negotiation and investment; many clients have specific properties in mind and again may have specific and unique needs and requirements. The team at Aston Chase is able to respond with their collective experience and dynamism to provide bespoke property solutions for all of their clients. The company has a division that has been established to provide property investment advice and planning for select clients who are searching for long-term property solutions and property in London as a sustainable investment.\nIn many ways, Aston Chase is a community-based agency; they have remained committed to their niche market and to the growth of real estate in their areas. Keen supporters of “Norwood”, a not-for-profit organisation that supports and helps families and children in need, both Richard and Mark encourage all of their employees to make a difference by giving of their time and skills to enhance, protect and cherish their communities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0021/9046/219046v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0021/9046/219046v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0021/9046/219046v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder and director","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Pollack","permalink":"mark-pollack","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Negotiator","person":{"first_name":"Howard","last_name":"Kayman","permalink":"howard-kayman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/2277/222277v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0022/2277/222277v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[296,443],"assets/images/resized/0022/2277/222277v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder and director","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Pollack","permalink":"mark-pollack-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Hampstead Garden Suburb ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Regent’s Park","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.astonchaseinfo.co.uk/","title":" Aston Chase – St Johns Wood"}]}
