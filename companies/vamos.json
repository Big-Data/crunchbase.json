It&#8217;s an easy way to get an overview of when an event starts, where it is &amp; the pictures taken from there.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n\n<p>The app aims to pull together events from every possible source – starting initially with Facebook – and you can see what’s on now, what’s hot and what your friends are attending. The app, which is currently in limited beta, is clean and easy to use, and provides a list of all public Facebook events close to you which are happening now as well as later. There is also a function to see which of your FB friends are going to what.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind Vamos, then, is to allow users to find interesting things to do nearby. Their big vision of what the team wants to do and where the service hopefully will stand out from the competition is not just Facebook events but any events. So let’s say the city of New York comes and says, ‘these are all our exhibitions, our cultural events we are having in town,’ Vamos can bring that in and make it more interesting by adding a social layer on top of it. There are downsides, of course, to relying on Facebook events – there is potential for a great deal of spam or false advertising. But better filters are surely part of Vamos’ future thinking.</p>\n\n<p>The story behind Vamos is an interesting one. It has been a social collaboration between the co-founders and their friends – even the final name was suggested by a pal – which included a weekend hackathon in Berlin in February, marking the startup’s emergence as a serious project.</p>\n\n<p>As for the competition many current solutions are focused on planning what to do in advance – for concerts, say. But the space Vamos is targeting is in the here and now, where the user is. By enabling the user to make their next move, giving them enough information to not only convince themselves but to help them convince others. This will include geo-tagged photos from services like Instagram and EyeEm so users can see in real time what is happening at a venue.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/0901/200901v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/0901/200901v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/0901/200901v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Director & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Collinder","permalink":"erik-collinder","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Luis-Daniel","last_name":"Alegria","permalink":"luis-daniel-alegria-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Growth Officer & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Prentell","permalink":"david-prentell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jens","last_name":"Dressler","permalink":"jens-dressler","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Berlin HQ","address1":"Torstrasse 41","address2":"","zip_code":"10119","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0020/0900/200900v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0020/0900/200900v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,237],"assets/images/resized/0020/0900/200900v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://siliconallee.com/startups/2012/07/13/plan-your-night-out-on-the-hoof-with-vamos","title":""}]}
