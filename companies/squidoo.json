Lenses can be about anything, such as ideas, people or places, hobbies and sports, pets or products, philosophy, and politics. Lenses aren&#8217;t primarily intended to hold content; more emphasis is placed on recommending and then pointing to content on the web. </p>\n\n<p>Users who create lenses are called lensmasters. A lensmaster uses the tools available online to provide links, feeds, abstracts, and lists to users who are trying to make sense of a topic. For example, a single lens could point to Flickr photos, Google maps, blogs, eBay auctions, YouTube videos, and other links. Lensmasters are encouraged to promote personal agendas, expertise, causes, products, and opinions. Squidoo splits its revenue with its &#8220;co-op&#8221; of lensmasters: 5% goes straight to charity, first; then 50% goes to the lensmasters; lastly 45% goes to Squidoo.</p>\n\n<p>Similar companies /
