datastreams.</p>\n\n<p>Households that link their utility accounts for automatic tracking through EarthAid.net see all their utility accounts (electric, gas, and water) in one place, have all locally applicable energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs automatically highlighted, are able to compare their consumption with friends, family, and community trends, and become eligible to earn Earth Aid Rewards Points that are redeemable for exclusive offers and freebies from Earth Aid&#8217;s growing network of Rewards Partners in their first-of-its-kind rewards program for saving energy and water.</p>\n\n<p>By October 2009, Earth Aid&#8217;s patent-pending platform was already compatible with nearly 100 utilities in the United States - with both its utility datastream compatibility and consumer rewards network expanding rapidly throughout the country.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0006/3668/63668v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0006/3668/63668v2-max-250x250.png"],[[342,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/3668/63668v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder
