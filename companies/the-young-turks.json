Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations. (American Heritage Dictionary)</p>\n\n<p>The Young Turks (Winner - 2011 Shorty Award for Best News/Politics Profile, Best Political Podcast &amp; Best Political News Site of 2009) were the first original talk show on Sirius satellite radio and the first live, daily webcast on the internet. But that is not the revolution.</p>\n\n<p>We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We are not afraid to talk about politics and entertainment and sports and pop culture. But that is not the revolution either.</p>\n\n<p>The real revolution is in daring to be honest with people. We dont patronize our viewers or lie to them. We have real conversations and deliver the news honestly.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/2211/132211v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0013/2211/132211v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0013/2211/132211v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Cenk","last_name":"Uygur","permalink":"cenk-uygur","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4198/134198v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/4198/134198v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/4198/134198v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Web Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Wysocki","permalink":"aaron-wysocki","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0013/4197/134197v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,179],"assets/images/resized/0013/4197/134197v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,322],"assets/images/resized/0013/4197/134197v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Best Political Podcast Award","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast_Awards","source_text":null,"source_description":"2009 Podcast Award Winners","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"The Young Turks","permalink":"the-young-turks"}},{"description":"Mashable Open Web Award, Best Political News Site","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://mashable.com/owa/pages/winners","source_text":null,"source_description":"Mashable Open Web Award","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"The Young Turks","permalink":"the-young-turks"}},{"description":"Shorty Award, Politics/News","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://youtu.be/IrKOXMG6hOU","source_text":null,"source_description":"Shorty Award Winner, News/Politics","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"The Young Turks","permalink":"the-young-turks"}},{"description":"Webby People's Voice Award, News & Politics Series","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=15#film_news_series","source_text":null,"source_description":"Webby People's Voice Award, News & Politics Series","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"The Young Turks","permalink":"the-young-turks"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hfSTH5dnzPk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hfSTH5dnzPk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Who Is Cenk Uygur?</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/feb8Jx70_5I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/feb8Jx70_5I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Who Are The Young Turks?</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/theyoungturks","title":"YouTube Channel"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/tytnation","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/theyoungturks","title":"Twitter"}]}
