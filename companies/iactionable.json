We believe that with better, clearer feedback and distinct recognition we can help companies and employees better align their focus and efforts.</p>\n\n<p>We offer a white label gamification platform that can power loyalty, rewards, and recognition systems across disparate systems. Using our platform, customers can drive very specific business goals using gamification techniques. No two companies are alike and so the system is highly customizable to reflect the vastly different approaches that customers may choose to take.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also built Engage, the first turn-key gamification solution for Salesforce.com that can be used to drive adoption, compliance, and productivity within SFDC directly. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0009/9519/99519v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/9519/99519v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/9519/99519v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Engage by IActionable","permalink":"engage-by-iactionable","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Elkins","permalink":"ryan-elkins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Barnes","permalink":"jason-barnes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Charlie","last_name":"Besecker","permalink":"charlie-besecker","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Bunchball","permalink":"bunchball","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/2917/2917v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/2917/2917v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/2917/2917v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"BigDoor","permalink":"bigdoor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0006/2691/62691v6-max-150x150.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0006/2691/62691v6-max-250x250.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0006/2691/62691v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Gamify","permalink":"gamify","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/8171/98171v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,130],"assets/images/resized/0009/8171/98171v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[303,158],"assets/images/resized/0009/8171/98171v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Badgeville","permalink":"badgeville","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0009/5585/95585v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0009/5585/95585v5-max-250x250.png"],[[256,66],"assets/images/resized/0009/5585/95585v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.BoomStartup.com","source_description":"BoomStartup","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"BoomStartup","permalink":"boomstartup","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/9880/79880v1-max-150x150.png"],[[226,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/9880/79880v1-max-250x250.png"],[[226,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/9880/79880v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Pestana","permalink":"john-pestana","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Utah Angels","permalink":"utah-angels","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"IActionable","address1":"251 W Riverpark Dr #300","address2":"","zip_code":"84604","city":"Provo","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0014/6537/146537v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0014/6537/146537v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0014/6537/146537v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturepimp.com/post/903678173/iactionable","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.sexysocialmedia.com/iactionable-bring-elements-of-social-gaming-to-your-website/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/iactionable-com-add-game-elements-to-your-site","title":""},{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/07/18/achievements-points-and-leaderboards-hit-the-workplace-with-engage-for-salesforce-com/","title":"Gamification hits the workplace"}]}
