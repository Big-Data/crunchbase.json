Most of the startups listed on Seedrs are eligible for the scheme, so investors can easily take advantage of the reliefs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/7025/87025v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/7025/87025v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,117],"assets/images/resized/0008/7025/87025v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Lynn","permalink":"jeff-lynn","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/7023/87023v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,204],"assets/images/resized/0008/7023/87023v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,204],"assets/images/resized/0008/7023/87023v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and COO","person":{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Silva","permalink":"carlos-silva","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£1.28M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.seedrs.com/about_us/news#13_seedrs_completes_1_million_fundraising_round","source_description":"Seedrs Completes £1 Million Fundraising Round","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":22,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":125000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"2 Chapel Place","address2":"Rivington Street","zip_code":"EC2A 3DQ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Won first place in the London Web Summit startup competition","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":19,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/seedrs-wins-london-web-summit-competition-as-europeans-rock-their-ecosystem/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Tech Crunch","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Seedrs","permalink":"seedrs"}},{"description":"Named one of East London's 20 Hottest Tech Companies","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":8,"source_url":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/08/east-london-20-hottest-tech-companies","source_text":null,"source_description":"The Guardian","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Seedrs","permalink":"seedrs"}},{"description":"Winner of the Smarta 100","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.smarta.com/smarta100/2012/seedrs","source_text":null,"source_description":"Smarta","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Seedrs","permalink":"seedrs"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/49257988?badge=0\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> ","description":"<p>Learn more about Seedrs</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xv92kb\"></iframe><br /><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xv92kb_seedrs-sees-high-risk-high-reward-in-startups_news\" target=\"_blank\">Seedrs Sees `High Risk, High Reward&#039; in Startups</a> <i>by <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/Bloomberg\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a></i>","description":"<p>Seedrs Talks High Risk and High Reward with Bloomberg TV</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0022/0505/220505v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0022/0505/220505v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0022/0505/220505v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/31ed2fa6-22aa-11e2-938d-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F31ed2fa6-22aa-11e2-938d-00144feabdc0.html&_i_referer=#axzz2CaYemfxR","title":"Start-ups take root with Seedrs funds"},{"external_url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/seedrs-sees-high-risk-high-reward-in-startups-BM5Kn1f7RaSnpJEEWefoBA.html","title":"Bloomberg TV Interview with Jeff Lynn - Seedrs"}]}
