It is called www.doodlemat.com and its prime purpose is to connect students around the world, and facilitate them regarding their academic career.</p>\n\n<p>How can doodlemat.com help:</p>\n\n<p>It helps students to â€¦</p>\n\n<pre><code>Get to know their new classmates\nFind new students from all over the world\nBuy or sell respectively things through ads\nUpload documents ( files ) and share them with their studentmates ( no need for cds and flash drivers anymore! )\nKeep themselves posted regarding the events of their area\nCreate their own questionnaires online and send it to their doodlemates\nShare their views and surveys\nCreate their own blog and share points of view\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It helps the universitiesâ€¦</p>\n\n<pre><code>To collect all of their students in a group\nDispense publications, surveys, documents to all students\nInform, help and solve questions that may arise through the forum that its separate group has.\nMake known all the events it organizes\nPublish spots of its history and stand its facilities out.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It helps in securityâ€¦</p>\n\n<p>Our team takes under serious consideration the security of studentâ€™s personal info and that is why we simplify the settings of classified for everyone. Furthermore, through the classified settings, the student can decide his/herself who can have access in his/her profile, without subtext.</p>\n\n<p>In helps the life in the makingâ€¦</p>\n\n<p>Your account in doodlemat does not ever stop to be valid ( only if you deside to abolish it ). Practically, it means that when the student graduates and start his/her business, he/her can publish an ad in order to find people from the academic background needed. That service makes doodlemat the multi-tool for a student.\nConsidering all things mentioned above, it is crystal clear that doodlemat is not another site of socialization, but an absolute specialized and adjusted social network for a student. Any other comparison with other social networks is pointless.</p>\n\n<p>Yours faithfully,\nThe administration team of doodlemat.com,\nEpameinondas Anezakis\nLefteris Theodorakis</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0016/1003/161003v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0016/1003/161003v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,113],"assets/images/resized/0016/1003/161003v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
