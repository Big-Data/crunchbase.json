Instead, the E-Sense system stimulates your fingers or hand with an electrical field to simulate the feeling of friction or texture.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0004/2841/42841v2-max-150x150.png"],[[201,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/2841/42841v2-max-250x250.png"],[[201,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/2841/42841v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"E-Sense","permalink":"e-sense","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Moaffak","last_name":"Ahmed","permalink":"moaffak-ahmed","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ville","last_name":"Makinen","permalink":"ville-makinen","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.senseg.com/wp-content/uploads/asi-vera-senseg_release_190508.pdf","source_description":"ASI Invests in Sensegâ€™s New Touch Interface Technology","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Ambient Sound Investments","permalink":"ambient-sound-investments","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,8],"assets/images/resized/0002/2826/22826v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,14],"assets/images/resized/0002/2826/22826v5-max-250x250.png"],[[250,14],"assets/images/resized/0002/2826/22826v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Seed Fund Vera Ltd","permalink":"seed-fund-vera-ltd","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Senseg Oy","address2":"Valimotie 27","zip_code":"00380 ","city":"Helsinki","state_code":null,"country_code":"FIN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0004/3007/43007v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0004/3007/43007v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,346],"assets/images/resized/0004/3007/43007v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/30/startup-senseg-promises-game-changing-tactile-technology/","title":"Startup Senseg promises â€œgame changingâ€ tactile technology"}]}
