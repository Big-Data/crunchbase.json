This missing link is &#8220;EMOTIONS&#8221;. Emote believes that communications + emotions create connections and an emotion is worth a thousand words. Emote is an attempt at creating this missing link by attaching an emotion to each notice posted by its users and in doing so, emote stands out from other plain microblogging sites.</p>\n\n<p>Emote aims for people communicating online to now start connecting with each other, and with themselves. Posting on emote creates an online emotional journal of your journey through life; and hence the concept of &#8220;LIFESTREAMING&#8221;. Lifestream enables others to know you better and connect with you. Lifestream also enables one to connect with self by reliving old memories and reminiscing about the past.</p>\n\n<p>Emote builds upon widely used and understood microblogging framework. However emote also adds onto the features provided by plain microblogging sites in the way information is presented to the users. Emote marries the vertical notice list used by microblogging with a &#8220;BEAUTIFUL SCROLLING TIMELINE&#8221; to create a unique and enhanced user experience. Timeline displays a user&#8217;s lifestream on a horizontal canvas and provides control and capability to go back in time, connecting past seamlessly with the present.</p>\n\n<p>Blogging -&gt; Microblogging -&gt; ?\nEmote is the answer. Itâ€™s a fresh idea and its time has come&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>What emote does:</p>\n\n<p>Emote provides a microblogging platform with an extended capability of attaching an &#8220;EMOTION&#8221; with each notice. </p>\n\n<p>People have so many things to say - a constant stream of thoughts, comments &amp; observations running continuously through their mind. Emote is the place to share and jot&#8217;em down.</p>\n\n<p>Emote is a digital diary, recollection of one&#8217;s life. People often feel reminiscing about their past. On Emote, people can visit notable dates &amp; see what they were up to, on their lifestream, hence re-living old memories.</p>\n\n<p>Emote for your friends &amp; family. For a lot of people, most of their time is spent away from their loved ones (maybe office/business trips etc). Lifestreaming on emote keeps their loved ones up-to-date with what&#8217;s going on in their life.</p>\n\n<p>For everyone there is an inherent need and want to be heard. Emote is the place to make yourself heard. People can reach broader audience and get acknowledged. One does not have to be loud; just have to be on emote.</p>\n\n<p>Lifestream provides a window into one&#8217;s life and inspire and enrich those who idolize them. Lifestream paints a picture of one&#8217;s life.</p>\n\n<p>Emote can help people build and promote their identity. People can promote their knowledge in an area and can gain readership as an expert and grow a following, turning themselves into a brand.</p>\n\n<p>For businesses, Lifestreaming is a great way to promote their products. Emote can prove to be a very valuable tool in their social media arsenal.</p>\n\n<p>There is an urgent need for businesses and organization to grow digital interactions. It&#8217;s not enough to just own a web-address anymore. There is a need to create meaningful relationship with customers. Emote empowers them to achieve this.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0006/6266/66266v4-max-150x150.png"],[[240,72],"assets/images/resized/0006/6266/66266v4-max-250x250.png"],[[240,72],"assets/images/resized/0006/6266/66266v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Gaurav","last_name":"Wasan","permalink":"gaurav-wasan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sarabjeet","last_name":"Singh","permalink":"sarabjeet-singh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Gagan","last_name":"Wasan","permalink":"gagan-wasan","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0006/6263/66263v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0006/6263/66263v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0006/6263/66263v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0006/6264/66264v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0006/6264/66264v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0006/6264/66264v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0006/6265/66265v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0006/6265/66265v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0006/6265/66265v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.startupne.ws/2009/11/emotein-write-and-share-your-feelings.html","title":"In news"},{"external_url":"http://www.avashya.com/articles/101649/emote-sharing-emotions-from-tears-to-cheers/","title":"In news"},{"external_url":"http://diystartupnews.com/2009/11/14/www-emote-in-from-tears-to-cheers-broadcast-here/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","title":"In news"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Comm/emote-in-microblog-the-way-your-are-feeling","title":"In news"}]}
