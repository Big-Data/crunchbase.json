Over the years they have worked very closely with agents and companies both large and small, providing the technology to support their core business, selling homes. Their goal is to &#8220;Empower the real estate professional&#8221; and as an extension empower the consumer. They don&#8217;t believe in placing additional barriers between the consumer and the agent.</p>\n\n<p>In June 2006, they launched the ActiveRain Real Estate Network, a free social network and marketing platform for real estate professionals. This network helps agents to create business relationships both within the industry and with the consumer.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/4416/34416v3-max-150x150.png"],[[198,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/4416/34416v3-max-250x250.png"],[[198,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/4416/34416v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/President","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Heaton","permalink":"matt-heaton-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/8327/48327v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/8327/48327v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/8327/48327v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Washburn","permalink":"jonathan-washburn","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.75M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/01/21/activerain-soaks-up-275m-for-real-estate-networking/","source_description":"VentureBeat","raised_amount":2750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"HouseValues","permalink":"housevalues","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0003/4417/34417v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0003/4417/34417v1-max-250x250.png"],[[383,174],"assets/images/resized/0003/4417/34417v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Weber Thompson Building","address1":"225 Terry Ave North","address2":"101","zip_code":"98109","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
