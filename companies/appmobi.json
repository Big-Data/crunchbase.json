The company has focused on products that advance the mobile market&#8217;s shift from proprietary native tools and services to industry standards HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. </p>\n\n<p>While the emerging HTML5 standard offers the mobile industry ease of app development and freedom from fragmentation, it lacks a number of key features that drove Apple&#8217;s rapid ascent to market leader. appMobi&#8217;s mission is to provide the missing features that will allow HTML5 to compete and win against proprietary solutions. Specifically, these features include an HTML5 development, debugging, and build system, user authentication, &#8216;touch to buy&#8217; , push notifications, user analytics, and on-device app updates. appMobi has created best-of-breed solutions for each of these issues. In June 2012, appMobi announced the addition of its 50,000th HTML5 developer, and that apps created with its platform had crossed over 100 million app starts. </p>\n\n<p>appMobi&#8217;s XDK (cross platform development kit) allows developers to use HTML5 technology to create fully functional mobile apps that run across different hardware platforms, including Android and iOs. Additionally, the XDK can render the exact same code as a &#8216;web app&#8217; or an &#8216;enhanced&#8217; web app that performs exactly the same as a native app. In August 2011, appMobi made the XDK available as a plugin for the Google Chrome browser, offering developers an extremely easy to use tool stack for HTML5.</p>\n\n<p>In February, 2011, appMobi announced its MobiUs web browser, which allows HTML5 web apps to perform exactly the same native functions as native apps, through the use of appMobi&#8217;s JavaScript &#8220;bridge&#8221;. The MobiUs browser allows app developers to choose their method of distribution, either the convential app stores, or to distribute through the web, retaining full control and monetization. The iOS implementation of mobiUs became available in August 2011 in the Apple App Store, and it was released as open source in October, 2011. An Android version of mobiUs will be released in 3Q2012.</p>\n\n<p>In December, 2011, appMobi released its directCanvas technology as open source. directCanvas speeds HTML5 game screen rendering by as much as 18x, delivering &#8220;native&#8221; game performance to games written with HTML5. Also in December, ReadWriteWeb named appMobi as the &#8220;Most Promising Company for 2012&#8221;. </p>\n\n<p>On February 13, 2012, appMobi announced playMobi, a HTML5 game development API that provides in-app purchasing, analytics, and social engagement tools that supports iOS, Android, Facebook and Open Web with a single code base. </p>\n\n<p>March 12, 2012, appMobi released version 1.0 of jqMobi, an open source  jQuery-like JavaScript framework that is highly optimized for delivering an identical user experience on Android and iOs HTML5 mobile apps. </p>\n\n<p>In June 2012, the company released &#8220;Boom Town&#8221;, a demonstration of how its HTML5 technology could be used to create a popular game that runs on iOS phones and tablets, Android phones and tablets, Facebook and Chrome from a single code base.  The game showcases appMobi&#8217;s HTML5-based social badges and leaderboards, deep Facebook integration, authentication and cross platform in-app purchasing and game continuity capabilities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0010/6782/106782v2-max-150x150.png"],[[217,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/6782/106782v2-max-250x250.png"],[[217,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/6782/106782v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"appMobi
