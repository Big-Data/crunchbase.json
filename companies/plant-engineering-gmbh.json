Sadly, these projects partially failed, due to delays in the delivery of installations and components. \nThis led to the discovery of our niche market. This is how the &#8220;Fast Track Engineering Solutions&#8221; as part of our business was born. \nWe go back to used installations and components and renovate them to meet the latest state of the art. \nThis, combination allows us a high level of flexibility, meaning we can adapt our services to the customer&#8217;s individual needs. </p>\n\n<p>This is the reason why we are interested to purchase or sell such units!</p>\n\n<p>A classic example of such a combination is a used steam turbine (having been overhauled) and a new boiler, adapted for use with the desired fuel. \nThis can be combined with the dismantling and reassembly of the installation. \nIn this way, project completion times are significantly shortened as manufacturing times are reduced.</p>\n\n<p>Best Regards</p>\n\n<p>Dr.-Ing.
