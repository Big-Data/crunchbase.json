No one ( eHarmony, Chemistry, PerfectMatch, PlentyOfFish Chemistry Predictor, Meetic, Be2, RewardingLove, Parship, True, etc) can prove its matching algorithm can match prospective partners who will have more stable and satisfying relationships than couples matched by chance, astrological destiny, personal preferences, searching on one&#8217;s own, or other technique as the control group in a peer_reviewed Scientific Paper. They are all like placebo, because</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Actual online dating sites offering compatibility matching methods, when calculating compatibility between prospective mates, have less or at least the same precision as searching on one&#8217;s own. [in the range of 3 or 4 persons compatible per 1,000 persons screened]</li>\n<li>That is because they use:\na) simplified versions of personality traits, instead of the 16PF5 or similar with the complete inventory (16 variables) \nb) inadequate quantitative methods to calculate compatibility between prospective mates, like eHarmony which uses Dyadic Adjustment Scale or other sites which use multivariate linear / logistic regression equations o other equations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To solve that problem I propose:\n*) the 16PF5 or similar normative personality test to measure personality of normal persons over 26 years old interested in serious dating. \nNo actual online dating site offering compatibility matching methods uses the 16PF5 normative test available in different languages.</p>\n\n<p>*) a new quantitative method to calculate compatibility between prospective mates, based on quantized pattern comparison (part of pattern recognition by correlation) named LIFEPROJECT method.\nThe value of my algorithm is to achieve far more precision than searching on one&#8217;s own [in the range of 3 persons compatible per 100,000 persons screened, 100 times better than actual competitors]\nand \ntry to prove if only high level on  personality*  similarity* between mates is the core of relationship stability and satisfaction for normal persons over 26 years old interested in serious dating. \n*personality: measured with the 16PF5 normative test in different languages.\n*similarity: calculated using the method I had invented, LIFEPROJECT method.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0011/5249/115249v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0011/5249/115249v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,133],"assets/images/resized/0011/5249/115249v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Mr.","person":{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"Ardenghi","permalink":"fernando-ardenghi-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/5773/115773v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[231,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/5773/115773v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[317,343],"assets/images/resized/0011/5773/115773v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>public photo</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"eHarmony","permalink":"eharmony","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Chemistry","permalink":"chemistry","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"eDarling","permalink":"edarling","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Meetic Affinity","permalink":"meetic-affinity","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"PlentyOfFish Marriage Predictor","permalink":"plentyoffish-marriage-predictor","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"1000","city":"Buenos Aires","state_code":null,"country_code":"ARG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"244\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lp0OgODz-AY\" width=\"392\"></iframe>","description":"<p>LIFEPROJECT METHOD personality matching system</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2008/07/lifeproject-met.html","title":"Interview at Online Personals Watch"}]}
