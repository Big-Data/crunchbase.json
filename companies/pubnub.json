We make it easy for developers to add massively multi-user capabilities to their applications without learning to be a real-time communications expert.</p>\n\n<p>PubNub is enabling a fundamental change in the way humans interact online. For the first time in human history, we can be connected to everyone else in the world with less than 1/4 second latency; in other words, can all connected in “real-time”. Yet our online experiences are barely beginning to catch up with that fact. Until now, only companies who invest millions in building proprietary real-time technology can build real-time apps like Skype, World of Warcraft, WebEx, real-time financials apps, and SecondLife.   PubNub democratizes the ability for every software developer to add massively multi-user experiences to the apps and websites they develop.</p>\n\n<p>PubNub is a cloud service so there is no operational expertise required and zero system management effort. Developers simply connect their apps to PubNub and we take care of the rest – monitoring and managing the servers, networks, security and administration. We ensure the scalability and reliability of the service and provide our customers with a guaranteed service level.</p>\n\n<p>PubNub is amazingly fast, globally scalable, and designed for devices to send and receive millions of messages in milliseconds without any excess overhead. PubNub developers have optimized the service to be the fastest real-time communications cloud available. Our distributed architecture is deployed worldwide in multiple datacenters to deliver local access speeds across the globe. Any device can publish or listen to any other device anywhere in the world with amazing performance.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0015/9557/159557v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/9557/159557v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0015/9557/159557v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Blum","permalink":"stephen-blum","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/4589/144589v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/4589/144589v2-max-250x250.png"],[[346,346],"assets/images/resized/0014/4589/144589v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Greene","permalink":"todd-greene","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/5793/145793v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/5793/145793v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/5793/145793v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Doron","last_name":"Sherman","permalink":"doron-sherman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Wendy","last_name":"Schott","permalink":"wendy-schott","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"Wesker","permalink":"todd-greene-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Doron","last_name":"Sherman","permalink":"doron-sherman-3","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Doron","last_name":"Sherman","permalink":"doron-sherman-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/21/as-developers-seek-more-interactivity-pubnub-raises-4-5m-for-its-in-app-messaging-solution/","source_description":"PubNub Raises $4.5M For Its In-App Messaging Solution","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Relay Ventures","permalink":"relay-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0018/0386/180386v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0018/0386/180386v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[354,72],"assets/images/resized/0018/0386/180386v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"TiE Angels","permalink":"tie-angels","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"PubNub, Inc.","address1":"1045 17th St","address2":"Suite 204","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/jZgcEj_qKLU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>PubNub Song!</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,109],"assets/images/resized/0018/0388/180388v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,182],"assets/images/resized/0018/0388/180388v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,329],"assets/images/resized/0018/0388/180388v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://gigaom.com/2012/03/20/pubnub-funding/","title":"PubNub raises $4.5M to bring real-time messaging to apps"},{"external_url":"http://vimeo.com/pubnub","title":"PubNub Training Videos"},{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/11/from-devops-to-noops-10-cloud.php","title":"10 Cloud Services You Should Be Using"},{"external_url":"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pubnub-appoints-proven-internet-infrastructure-luminaries-for-management-team-2012-04-12","title":"Press release: April 12, 2012, 4:02 p.m. EDT PubNub Appoints Proven Internet Infrastructure Luminaries for Management Team"},{"external_url":"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/pubnub/info","title":"PubNub on Stack Overflow"},{"external_url":"http://startuptunes.com/2012/07/18/pubnub-super-speedy-communications-between-server-mobile-web/","title":""}]}
