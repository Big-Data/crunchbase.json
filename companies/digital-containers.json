This system/service allows users to get movies, tv shows, games, books, music and more in true peer to peer fashion&#8211;  directly from people they trust.  </p>\n\n<p>For end-users, they get access to entire new categories of content,  get content delivered in a richer user environment,  they get to keep in on their machine (computer or phone), and they get to share it on to their friends (and participate in downstream revenue opportunities!).</p>\n\n<p>For content owners, they get to fully leverage the Internet&#8217;s P2P infrastructure, have no back end requirements (no server farms, no fat pipes), and they both extend their current advertising-based revenue models (more views, higher CPM), while adding new methods to monetize (direct sales, related product sales, tie-ins).</p>\n\n<p>Content is simply placed inside a digital container, cryptographically sealed, and then shared on the net.  Since it&#8217;s a single file (.swf format), it can be searched for, emailed, rss fed, BitTorrent&#8217;ed, thumb-driven, social networked&#8211;  anything that shares.  The difference is that on the outside of this sealed container there is a metrics engine that allows for advertising within, and a monetization engine, if the owner/viewer wish to engage in commerce.  Digital Containers work with all the major players (Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, etc), and even allow streaming players to work when not connected a server.</p>\n\n<p>Peer to peer file share is the way people like to get content.  Now, with the advent of Digital Containers, it works for the good stuff too!</p>\n\n<p>(Note:  Digital Containers began life in the 90&#8217;s as DeskGate, and now that the software is done and the patents have been awarded, it is being relaunched in LA &#8211; Summer 2008)</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,147],"assets/images/resized/0002/1709/21709v1-max-150x150.png"],[[209,206],"assets/images/resized/0002/1709/21709v1-max-250x250.png"],[[209,206],"assets/images/resized/0002/1709/21709v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"tom-patterson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Chip","last_name":"Venters","permalink":"chip-venters","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/9762/119762v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/9762/119762v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[308,397],"assets/images/resized/0011/9762/119762v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>CVenters</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Samit","permalink":"jay-samit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/7497/87497v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[172,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/7497/87497v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[310,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/7497/87497v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Branding","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"X-Ist","permalink":"x-ist","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$10M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Founders","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2000,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"Founders","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2004,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"2001 Wilshire Blvd.Suite 501 ","address2":"","zip_code":"90403","city":"Santa Monica","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.031957,"longitude":-118.483304}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://tinyurl.com/638pl3","title":"Lennon loves it!"}]}
