They&#8217;re struggling to break out of the gym-bar-date rut and stop doing the same things with the same people. The problem is they&#8217;re busy and it&#8217;s frustrating to figure out what&#8217;s worthwhile because there&#8217;s no trusted source for recommendations. And it sucks finding out about an opportunity when it&#8217;s already too late!</p>\n\n<p>BSC is how you break out of that rut. BSC curates the one essential activity, workout, event or product you need today to make memorable experiences you can share. It&#8217;s where you discover everything from a zombie obstacle course to a smartphone app that pays you to exercise. And BSC makes it easy to share these things, so you can go out, feel healthy, have fun with friends or enjoy more interesting dates. </p>\n\n<p>The BSC team lives what they do. They spotlight only the things they&#8217;d tell our friends. Nothing less. They are a dodgeball player, a marathoner, two Tough Mudder finishers and a beer mug lifting champion. They are also journalists from Maxim, Forbes and ABC News and management from AOL, Soccer.com and Jetsetter. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0019/9418/199418v2-max-150x150.png"],[[216,199],"assets/images/resized/0019/9418/199418v2-max-250x250.png"],[[216,199],"assets/images/resized/0019/9418/199418v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Ages","permalink":"jonathan-ages","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Web Manager","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Toomes","permalink":"brian-toomes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Jake","last_name":"Schonfeld","permalink":"jake-schonfeld","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Jake","last_name":"Schonfeld","permalink":"jake-schonfeld-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Editor","person":{"first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Brukman","permalink":"jesse-brukman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Assistant Editor","person":{"first_name":"Erin","last_name":"Kelly","permalink":"erin-kelly","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Assistant Editor","person":{"first_name":"Erin","last_name":"Kelly","permalink":"erin-kelly-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Thrillist Media Group","permalink":"thrillist-media-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0017/7269/177269v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/7269/177269v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0017/7269/177269v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"UrbanDaddy","permalink":"urbandaddy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0019/8108/198108v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,238],"assets/images/resized/0019/8108/198108v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,430],"assets/images/resized/0019/8108/198108v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Outside magazine","permalink":"outside-magazine","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Men's Journal","permalink":"mens-journal","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Men's Health","permalink":"mens-health","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"NYC Office","address1":"12 Desbrosses","address2":"","zip_code":"10013","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0019/9416/199416v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0019/9416/199416v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,375],"assets/images/resized/0019/9416/199416v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[91,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/9417/199417v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[152,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/9417/199417v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[275,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/9417/199417v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/blogs/smitten/2011/05/bored-with-old-school-dinner-d.html","title":"Bored With Old School Dinner Dates?
