Users receive an email with a link to the app in the App Store where they can purchase the app and a coupon code. </p>\n\n<p>Once the app is purchased and downloaded, users are prompted to enter the coupon code once inside the Appâ€™s interface.  The app can also be prompted by shaking the phone.  Once the code is entered, TapZilla automatically puts the app cost in the buyerâ€™s PayPal account or can issue an iTunes gift card.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0010/5492/105492v1-max-150x150.png"],[[244,57],"assets/images/resized/0010/5492/105492v1-max-250x250.png"],[[244,57],"assets/images/resized/0010/5492/105492v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"TapZilla.com","permalink":"tapzilla-com","image":null},{"name":"AppRebates.com","permalink":"apprebates-com","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0010/5509/105509v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0010/5509/105509v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0010/5509/105509v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/13/tapzilla-offers-daily-deals-for-paid-mobile-apps/","title":"Leena Rao, TechCrunch"}]}
