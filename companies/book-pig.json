Similar to NetFlix, Book Pig delivers a package of books tailored to the children&#8217;s tastes and reading levels.</p>\n\n<p>The service includes an excellent suggestion tool specifically for children&#8217;s books, staff recommendations and the ability to queue individual books or entire series.  The service includes free shipping both ways and comes in a big red reusable box that&#8217;s fun for kids.</p>\n\n<p>The service starts with a three week free trial and monthly subscriptions start at 11.95.  Cancel at any time.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of Book Pig is to get children to read more.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that children who learn to read more do better in life. Freakonomics author Stephen Levitt states bluntly, &#8220;Books in the home equal higher test scores.&#8221; We all know it&#8217;s true, so with all that incentive&#8230;\nWhy is getting children to read so hard?</p>\n\n<p>We believe there are three basic reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Books are inconvenient. Compared to TV where I can see something new and engaging with the touch of a button, a trip to the bookstore is a relative hassle. With reading you have to plan ahead and what looked like fun in the bookstore doesn&#8217;t always look as fun back home.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reading is a forced march. &#8220;Read the book, take the test.&#8221; With so much emphasis on testing, schools teach children how to read but they don&#8217;t teach them to love reading. It&#8217;s just not part of their charter. So children are forced to read a lot books that simply don&#8217;t interest them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Children&#8217;s tastes and reading levels change fast. What thrilled them last summer bores them today. We hear this from parents all the time: &#8220;She has a shelf full of books and says there&#8217;s nothing to read.&#8221; Well, she&#8217;s probably right. Keeping a child&#8217;s bookshelf filled with interesting books that match their reading level is a time-consuming and expensive task that&#8217;s easy to fall behind on.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are some hard truths about children and reading, but there is an answer.</p>\n\n<p>Book Pig tackles the problem head on:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We make reading convenient. Each month your children receive a box of books automatically without a trip to the bookstore.  This means there&#8217;s always fresh unread books in your house.  Reach for the remote, reach for a fresh book - now it&#8217;s the same effort.</p></li>\n<li><p>We make reading a pleasure.  Packaged like a gift, Book Pig delivers books in a big bright red box.  It&#8217;s filled with books designed to draw your children into series and fresh books that match their tastes and reading levels perfectly.  And if they don&#8217;t like a book, send it back, with free shipping both ways there&#8217;s no pressure to read boring books.</p></li>\n<li><p>We keep the books flowing.  With each box of books we send a sticker pad your children use to note their opinion of each book.  Then we update their reading preferences and future books reflect their changing tastes and reading levels. We keep track of everything so there&#8217;s no more falling behind.</p></li>\n</ol>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/1645/71645v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0007/1645/71645v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[293,114],"assets/images/resized/0007/1645/71645v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Witchel","permalink":"john-witchel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Pigoski","permalink":"tom-pigoski","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BookSwim","permalink":"bookswim","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/9989/29989v4-max-150x150.png"],[[160,120],"assets/images/resized/0002/9989/29989v4-max-250x250.png"],[[160,120],"assets/images/resized/0002/9989/29989v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Chegg","permalink":"chegg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Booksfree","permalink":"booksfree","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0015/2206/152206v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0015/2206/152206v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[263,92],"assets/images/resized/0015/2206/152206v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"BookFinder.com","permalink":"bookfinder","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0002/3862/23862v1-max-150x150.png"],[[186,19],"assets/images/resized/0002/3862/23862v1-max-250x250.png"],[[186,19],"assets/images/resized/0002/3862/23862v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Book Pig","address1":"25 Stillman Street","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,139],"assets/images/resized/0007/1481/71481v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0007/1481/71481v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,417],"assets/images/resized/0007/1481/71481v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
