Our platform, ConceptDrop, is an engine for transforming a presentation into a winning, graphically enhanced pitch. ConceptDrop starts with customers dropping off skeletons, notes, or basic outlines of presentations. After quickly filling out a creative brief and setting a deadline, customers can return to our platform and download a presentation updated and enhanced by professional designers.  All presentations are secured and protected on the ConceptDrop platform. Corporations can share, update, and download presentations based upon a user hierarchy created in our system.</p>\n\n<p>We leverage partnerships to create a cost structure that yields competitive pricing and rapid turnaround for our customers. Our designers are available 24/7 and can be accessed directly through ConceptDrop.
