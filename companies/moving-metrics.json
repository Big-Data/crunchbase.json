The company specializes in product integration, or &#8220;branded entertainment.&#8221; By having influential YouTube video makers &#8220;vloggers&#8221; make videos using these products, Moving Metrics creates a seamless integration of advertising and content.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike product placement, Moving Metrics targets YouTube vloggers who would actually use the products advertised in their videos. For example, cooks who would make videos using cooking products, or personal trainers who would make videos using fitness products.</p>\n\n<p>Moving Metrics focuses on creating hyper-targeted marketing campaigns for brands so that they can reach their exact target consumer demographic. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0019/9446/199446v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0019/9446/199446v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,95],"assets/images/resized/0019/9446/199446v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brendan","last_name":"Lattrell","permalink":"brendan-lattrell-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1750/201750v2-max-150x150.png"],[[202,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/1750/201750v2-max-250x250.png"],[[364,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/1750/201750v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Brendan Lattrell</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brendan","last_name":"Lattrell","permalink":"brendan-lattrell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Wrenn","permalink":"jesse-wrenn","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
