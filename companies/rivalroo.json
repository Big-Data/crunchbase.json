This new chat platform is event driven and matches a fanâ€™s favorite team with its next opponent, allowing fans of each team to engage in lively and real-time sports talk. </p>\n\n<p>Rivalroo is now rolling out TEAMCHAT into other verticals including politics, entertainment, and fantasy sports.  The sports vertical is expanding to include world-wide soccer, NHL, and MMA.   </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0010/5126/105126v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0010/5126/105126v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0010/5126/105126v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Meredith","permalink":"matt-meredith","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"Meredith","permalink":"karen-meredith","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"CoverItLive","permalink":"coveritlive","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/2355/22355v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/2355/22355v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/2355/22355v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Meebo","permalink":"meebo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3436/3436v31-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0000/3436/3436v31-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0000/3436/3436v31-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Self","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Self","last_name":"funded","permalink":"self-funded","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Las Colinas HQ","address1":"251 O'connor Ridge","address2":"Suite 370","zip_code":"75038","city":"Irving","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0010/3472/103472v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,126],"assets/images/resized/0010/3472/103472v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,228],"assets/images/resized/0010/3472/103472v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3473/103473v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3473/103473v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3473/103473v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://metsmerizedonline.com/2010/06/site-news-keep-on-rocking-in-the-free-world.html","title":"Mets Site News"}]}
