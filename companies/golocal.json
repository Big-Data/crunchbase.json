A Giftly card can be customized to work at up to three different locations, so the recipient can have a choice of how and where to spend it.</p>\n\n<p>When a recipient wants to use his Giftly, he goes to Giftly.com on a mobile phone. Once Giftly verifies that the recipient is at one of the places on the gift card by checking the phone’s location data, the user can pay for something there exactly like he normally would, with cash or a credit card. Giftly immediately reimburses the designated amount to a registered credit card, debit card or PayPal account.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0016/5960/165960v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0016/5960/165960v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,214],"assets/images/resized/0016/5960/165960v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
