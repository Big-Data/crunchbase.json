At the end of the project period, a winning song is chosen and paid out the prize money.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, SwapBeats is a three-prong website that creates a new working paradigm for the music creation process.  SwapBeats provides:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1)  An online social and professional network for musicians to collaborate, inspire, and advise one another; \n2)  An online marketplace where musicians can buy/sell audio tracks, compete in music-related competitions for cash and prizes, and search or post music-related classified ads;\n3)  Song storage space that allows musicians to virtually store their recordings (think an FTP site).\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit - www.SwapBeats.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0003/9799/39799v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,174],"assets/images/resized/0003/9799/39799v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,314],"assets/images/resized/0003/9799/39799v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Projects (Song WorkSpace)","permalink":"projects-song-workspace","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Atkinson","permalink":"david-atkinson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Legal Councel","person":{"first_name":"Douglas","last_name":"M.
