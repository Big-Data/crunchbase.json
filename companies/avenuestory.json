We believe that in today&#8217;s travel trends the sophisticated traveller is increasingly turning away from the formulaic predictability of a hotel room: a double bed, a mini bar and a big bill at check-out. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as you enter the lobby of a typical four or five star hotel you are cocooned in a bland &#8216;anywhere&#8217; that actively shuts out the personality of the city outside. Everything from the decor to the restaurant menu is carefully designed along pre-established lines, so that the visitor has the same experience, from Bangkok to Berlin. For authenticity, freedom, space and an array of facilities,the option to stay in an apartment has it all. </p>\n\n<p>To get under the skin of a great city you need a key to your own door, to say &#8216;bonjour&#8217; to the neighbour on the floor below, to spread your wings and luxuriate in a real home – yours for the duration.</p>\n\n<p>We hope to see you in our apartments in Paris or London soon.</p>\n\n<p>Irina Raileanu\nAvenueStory</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Irina","last_name":"Raileanu","permalink":"irina-raileanu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Client Relationship Executive ","person":{"first_name":"Cecile","last_name":"Godard","permalink":"cecile-godard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operations Manager","person":{"first_name":"Sophie","last_name":"Higgins","permalink":"sophie-higgins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Client Relationship Executive ","person":{"first_name":"Gabi","last_name":"Gheerbrant","permalink":"gabi-gheerbrant","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London HQ","address1":"90 Long Acre","address2":"Covent Garden","zip_code":"WC2E 9RZ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Paris ","address1":"27 Avenue de l’Opera","address2":"","zip_code":"75001","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
