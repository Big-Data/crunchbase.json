They improve people’s lives and can in many cases even save them.</p>\n\n<p>For medication to be effective people have to take them according to their doctors advice.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately only about 50 % of people take their medicine correctly.  This is an international health problem and its consequences can be severe and costly.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that patients who don’t take their medicine as prescribed, cost the US healthcare system about $290 billion in avoidable medical spending each year.</p>\n\n<p>Today the problem is partly solved with dosage packed medicine.  Allthough this solution is helpful it is not sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>With RemindMe we intend to increase medical compliance and thereby increase people’s quality of life and in the mean time save billions of dollars for the healthcare system.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0020/5463/205463v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0020/5463/205463v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,348],"assets/images/resized/0020/5463/205463v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ingunn","last_name":"Gudbrandsdottir","permalink":"ingunn-gudbrandsdottir","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
