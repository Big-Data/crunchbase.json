The â€œvirtual-windowâ€ is based on a  large (22â€-60â€ size) screen, that in some installation types is embedded into a glass wall, in which we run one of a variety of scenic oriented, realistically looking virtual â€œlivingâ€ worlds. With no integration or connectivity to the elevatorâ€™s internal system apart from a standard electricity outlet and an existing building internet connection, our â€œvirtual-windowâ€ detects the movement of the elevatorâ€™s cab- so it â€œknowsâ€ whether it is stationary or moving, its direction, speed, location and degree of acceleration or deceleration. This is translated to the movement of the content- when the elevator goes up, the viewerâ€™s point of view goes up as well, so the view changes (e.g. floor-level objects stay down at floor level) as would occur if there was a real window. This synchronizes the sensation we feel with the one that we see- just like in a transparent elevator, and creates a better physical feeling. </p>\n\n<p>It doesnâ€™t stop here, though - certain content objects behave differently than others by escorting the â€œwindowâ€ as it moves. For example- in an ocean world that simulates an underwater elevator, a dolphin will follow the cab while the reef and other â€œregularâ€ fish stay at their initial height. The system is controlled by the DigiGage portal that includes a content library full of different content worlds with which the buildingâ€™s manager, the residing company or the tenants can swap the content of its elevatorsâ€™ winGage system in a click, such that a building in Rome can see in the virtual view of the Amazonas waterfalls in one week and jump in a click to the living vivid Times Square in NYC the week after. In addition, the system offers a user area that enables an in-building messaging system, floor numbering display, floor based textual data and real-time RSS feed based information strip.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0013/0026/130026v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0013/0026/130026v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,137],"assets/images/resized/0013/0026/130026v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Einav","permalink":"jonathan-einav","image":{"available_sizes":[[[78,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/0823/130823v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/0823/130823v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[234,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/0823/130823v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & Co-CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Kidron","permalink":"ben-kidron","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
