Like an interactive journey through the key media skills and processes of job-hunting, each user assumes the role of a &#8220;scout&#8221; on a digital discovery “trail” searching for Internet skills and employment. Along the way, they learn and develop fundamental skills such as searching job sites, resume writing, submitting online applications and peer-to-peer networking.</p>\n\n<p>Created to be consistent with the State of California&#8217;s Basic Digital Literacy Skills Framework, users earn badges for completing interactive lessons on everything from Internet browsers to how to create social network profiles and use them to gain employment. JobScout also boasts a custom resume builder and built-in job search function.</p>\n\n<p>JobScout in California Libraries</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>California State Library research shows that nearly 55% of Californians rely on libraries as their primary or only source of free online access.</li>\n<li>In 2011, 18,846 computers in public libraries were used more than 38 million times.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That is why JobScout is currently being piloted in over 130 library branches in California, including the San Jose Public Library, the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the Yolo County Library and the County of Los Angeles Public Library. JobScout is also expanding to new library jurisdictions and will be available in Imperial County and Santa Clara County library systems at the end of June 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/1084/191084v2-max-150x150.png"],[[247,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/1084/191084v2-max-250x250.png"],[[444,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/1084/191084v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"Gagnier","permalink":"christina-gagnier","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operations Officer","person":{"first_name":"Stephanie","last_name":"Margossian","permalink":"stephanie-margossian","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Designer","person":{"first_name":"Carter","last_name":"Fort","permalink":"carter-fort","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Marketing and Platform Satisfaction","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Bradley","permalink":"josh-bradley","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$300k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":30,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"101 Townsend St, Ste. 312","address2":"","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0019/1083/191083v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0019/1083/191083v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0019/1083/191083v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.MyJobScout.org","title":""}]}
