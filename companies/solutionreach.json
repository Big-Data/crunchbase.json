No extra per message costs (text or email) or support fees are ever charged. Everything is included!</p>\n\n<p>Software as a Service - Solutionreach is a SERVICE, not a product. This means our customers have all the benefits of ownership without the burden of a high cost maintenance contract.</p>\n\n<p>Practice Management Software Integration - Solutionreach integrates with the majority of practice management systems [PMS] at no cost to our customers. Our automated sync interfaces with their PMS and updates all changes. There is never a need for double entry.</p>\n\n<p>Simple &amp; Secure - Solutionreach security is very similar to that used in online banking. An SSL (secure socket layer) connection using 256-bit encryption keeps all the data transmissions safe. Solutionreach only reads data from customer&#8217;s practice management systems - eliminating the possibility of data corruption or virus transmission. As always, the service is HIPAA Ready.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0015/6809/156809v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,37],"assets/images/resized/0015/6809/156809v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,68],"assets/images/resized/0015/6809/156809v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Higgins","permalink":"jim-higgins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO/CFO","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Goates","permalink":"rob-goates","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Evans","permalink":"jacob-evans","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Architect","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Geertsen","permalink":"jay-geertsen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Corporate Development","person":{"first_name":"Tennli","last_name":"Toole","permalink":"tennli-toole","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"McKay","permalink":"bruce-mckay","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Business Development & Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Olson","permalink":"mark-olson-4","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"3098 Executive Parkway","address2":"Suite 300","zip_code":"84043","city":"Lehi","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<!-- Begin VideoJS -->\r\n  <div class=\"video-js-box\">\r\n    <!-- Using the Video for Everybody Embed Code http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody -->\r\n    <video class=\"video-js\" width=\"264\" height=\"206\" controls preload autoplay poster=\"http://www.solutionreach.com/videos/namechange.png\">\r\n      <source src=\"http://www.solutionreach.com/videos/namechange.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"' />\r\n      <source src=\"http://www.solutionreach.com/videos/namechange.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp8, vorbis\"' />\r\n      <source src=\"http://www.solutionreach.com/videos/namechange.ogv\" type='video/ogg; codecs=\"theora, vorbis\"' />\r\n      <!-- Flash Fallback.
