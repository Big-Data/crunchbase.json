The company is driving the development of Managed Video as a Service (MVaaS), which builds on the concept of the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. With the MVaaS platform, Envysion centrally manages software upgrades and version control and addresses the scaling challenges of managing distributed video systems across multiple locations.</p>\n\n<p>The Envysion Video service enables organizations to leverage remote video and gives operators the insight to improve performance in every location, every day. Operators benefit from remote viewing of live and recorded video from an unlimited number of locations. The service goes beyond traditional security and loss prevention applications by integrating video with business tools such as Point-of-Sale (POS) systems.</p>\n\n<p>via: <a href=\"http://www.envysion.com\" title=\"Envysion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Envysion</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/3817/23817v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/3817/23817v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[179,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/3817/23817v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Caruso","permalink":"dan-caruso","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Steinfort","permalink":"matt-steinfort","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Hagens","permalink":"robert-hagens","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Gregory","last_name":"Hodges","permalink":"gregory-hodges-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP, Sales and Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"Dawson","permalink":"bruce-dawson","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Axis","permalink":"axis","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$9.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.envysion.com/cms_web/infodtl.php?N_webcat_id=48&N_info_id=34","source_description":"Envysion Raises $3 Million","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Columbia Capital","permalink":"columbia-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0002/1471/21471v1-max-150x150.png"],[[241,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1471/21471v1-max-250x250.png"],[[241,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1471/21471v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"High Country Venture","permalink":"high-country-venture","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/8103/28103v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[228,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/8103/28103v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[228,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/8103/28103v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Bear Equity","permalink":"bear-equity","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/8930/28930v1-max-150x150.png"],[[108,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/8930/28930v1-max-250x250.png"],[[108,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/8930/28930v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.techrockies.com/envysion-raises-6-m/s-0007658.html","source_description":"Envysion Raises $6.5M","raised_amount":6500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":20,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Columbia Capital","permalink":"columbia-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0002/1471/21471v1-max-150x150.png"],[[241,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1471/21471v1-max-250x250.png"],[[241,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1471/21471v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"High Country Venture","permalink":"high-country-venture","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/8103/28103v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[228,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/8103/28103v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[228,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/8103/28103v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Bear Equity","permalink":"bear-equity","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/8930/28930v1-max-150x150.png"],[[108,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/8930/28930v1-max-250x250.png"],[[108,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/8930/28930v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"950 Spruce Street ","address2":"","zip_code":"80027","city":"Louisville","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.97764,"longitude":-105.13114}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
