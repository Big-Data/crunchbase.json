They automatically measure things like getting exercise, brushing your teeth, flossing, riding your bike, taking vitamins, and lots more.  Users simply stick the sensors on objects like a toothbrush.  The battery lasts a year; no recharging; 250ft range.  </p>\n\n<p>Behaviors are measured, wirelessly transmitted, and stored in a database.  GreenGoose assigns &#8220;lifestyle points&#8221; and a virtual game-play environment that changes as users do things in the real-world.  It also provides self-tracking and nudge &#8220;goose&#8221; mechanisms for keeping intentions.</p>\n\n<p>GreenGoose also enables other games and applications with an API.  Applications may leverage user supplied behavioral data to offer rewards or other incentives for doing positive things.  For instance, you could level-up in a different game by riding your bike or getting exercise.  Or, users could earn points toward virtual goods or credit transferable to loyalty programs with retailers.ss</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0013/2546/132546v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0013/2546/132546v2-max-250x250.png"],[[290,66],"assets/images/resized/0013/2546/132546v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Krejcarek","permalink":"brian-krejcarek-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/23/gamification-company-greengoose-raises-100k-on-stage-at-launch-conference/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Venturebeat_deals+%28VentureBeat+%C2%BB+Deals+%26+More%29","source_description":"Gamification company GreenGoose raises $100k on stage at Launch Conference","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":23,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Shervin","last_name":"Pishevar","permalink":"shervin-pishevar","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9149/19149v5-max-150x150.png"],[[182,228],"assets/images/resized/0001/9149/19149v5-max-250x250.png"],[[182,228],"assets/images/resized/0001/9149/19149v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.interplaycon.com/speakers\" title=\"Inter Play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inter Play</a></p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Levy","permalink":"jay-levy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/4831/74831v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/4831/74831v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/4831/74831v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"San Francisco","address1":"153 Townsend St.","address2":"Ste. 9051","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"GreenGoose gets accepted into Betaspring Startup Accelerator program.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.betaspring.com/portfolio/sensibleself","source_text":null,"source_description":"Betaspring","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"GreenGoose!","permalink":"greengoose"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0011/8273/118273v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,127],"assets/images/resized/0011/8273/118273v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,230],"assets/images/resized/0011/8273/118273v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
