Real-time advertising (also called real-time bidding) is a term which means the automated purchase and sale of digital advertising in the form of a real-time auction. Instead of the traditional static purchase of display advertising, Spree7 evaluates each individual advertising contact opportunity in real time before the purchase. The decision to purchase any banner placement is based on an analytical, data-based process which can be tracked transparently and used for further optimisation. This enables Spree7, together with agencies and advertisers, to develop efficient campaign approaches for display, mobile, social and video inventories which could previously not be implemented technically in a conventional manner.</p>\n\n<p>Spree7 GmbH is a joint venture of the Swiss PubliGroupe AG and the American real-time advertising pioneer MediaMath.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0022/3019/223019v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0022/3019/223019v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,176],"assets/images/resized/0022/3019/223019v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Berlin Office","address1":"Schlegelstra√üe 26a","address2":"","zip_code":"10115","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
