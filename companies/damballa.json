Their unique, global approach rapidly isolates the command-and-control needed to launch botnet attacks. These signatureless solutions improve security both inside and outside the network perimeter, stop threats other technologies miss and restore control to legitimate owners. Damballa identifies the severity and intent of these targeted attacks, even when malware canâ€™t be detected. Their products and services provide a critical window for orderly remediation and integrate easily into existing infrastructure without requiring additional headcount or complexity. Damballa is privately held, and is headquartered in Atlanta,
