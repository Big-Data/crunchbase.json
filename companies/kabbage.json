For the large and growing segment of online retailers who offer their products via online marketplaces, representing over $48 billion on <a href=\"/company/ebay\" title=\"Ebay\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ebay</a> alone in 2008, the divide is even greater.   This segment is underserved for financial services products because traditional underwriting and lending criteria do not account for a â€˜virtualâ€™ commerce business model, or the value of recently sold inventory.  </p>\n\n<p>The largest contingent of small businesses selling online is represented on Ebay, though there are many other platforms that facilitate transactions between buyers &amp; sellers, including <a href=\"/company/amazon\" title=\"Amazon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a> Marketplace, <a href=\"/company/etsy\" title=\"Etsy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Etsy</a>, <a href=\"/company/craigslist\" title=\"Craigslist\" rel=\"nofollow\">Craigslist</a>,  <a href=\"/company/ioffer\" title=\"iOffer\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOffer</a> and uBid.  While these platforms provide a low-cost marketing channel, the nature of online and auction sales necessitates a delay between the moment the item is listed and when it is sold.  This delay, combined with payment delays that can be imposed by <a href=\"/company/paypal\" title=\"PayPal\" rel=\"nofollow\">PayPal</a> and other payment types, creates a cash flow and growth constraint for many businesses. </p>\n\n<p>Online retail sales as a percentage of total retail sales have doubled in the past five years.  Ecommerce sales overall in 2006 were just over $107 billion, representing 2.7 percent of total retail sales .  There are over 100 million Ebay users in the US today, with an estimated 200 million new listings in 2Q, 2008 alone. There are an estimated 5 million power sellers transacting over $48 billion on Ebay and more than 8 million high-volume sellers representing over $70 billion across all marketplaces.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0007/1346/71346v3-max-150x150.png"],[[197,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/1346/71346v3-max-250x250.png"],[[197,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/1346/71346v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder
