Its mission is: Supporting Information Security Strategies and Guaranteeing Business Security. Proud of its professional experience, DFLabs provides consulting  and professional services in the following areas: Information Security Strategy, Incident/Fraud Prevention and Response, Digital Forensics, e-discovery, Litigation Support, Infosecurity Training, Intrusion Prevention, Log and Vulnerability Management. The company has also direct sales offices in USA and UK, and operates on a worldwide basis from its headquarters in Northern Italy. </p>\n\n<p>DFlabs has also an R&amp;D Facility specialized in IT GRC, Cloud Computing, incident handling and computer forensic software. At this stage the company developed two Products that are taking the attention from the customers: </p>\n\n<p>IncMan suite (http://incman.dflabs.com) </p>\n\n<p>DFLabs Incman Suite, an incident tracking software that enables the management of every kind of information security incidents. Incman supports the entire incident management process from security to fraud, including digital forensics, case management and  Incident Tracking. The Incident Management Suite comprises three modules that can operate autonomously or integrated in order to obtain a complete incident management centralized solution. IncMan Suite can be easly integrated with the existing Security Infrastructure. It can handle all the alerts and alarm messages automatically and start an escalation, if needed. IncMan Suite can be fully customized. And  is an ideal tool for C Level Executives and Operators who need a complete governance of their Security Tasks. IncMan, Incident Management Suite, supports all certification and accreditation processes required by the international regulations (from FISMA to SOX and similar) and is currently used by many Enterprise Customers worldwide. It is the sole suite currently available worldwide able to perform these tasks. It is also IODEF compliant.  </p>\n\n<p>PTK Forensics: (http: //ptk.dflabs.com) </p>\n\n<p>The PTK forensics is a computer forensic framework based on command line tools in the SleuthKit to which many new software modules were added. Thanks to this approach, users can investigate a system much easier, without spending huge money for Software like encase and ftk. PTK forensics is an alternative advanced framework for the TSK suite (The SleuthKit). Born as a free interface in order to improve the features already present in â€˜Autopsy Forensic Browserâ€™ (the former TSK interface), PTK Forensic is now much more. Thus, in addition to providing the features present in the &#8216;Autopsy Forensic Browser&#8217; it now implements numerous new essential forensic features. PTK forensics is more than just a new graphic and highly professional framework based on Ajax and other advanced technologies; it offers many features such as analysis, multi user search and management of complex digital investigation cases.  Forensics examiners use PTK as a great companion for their investigations, also because of the availability of an extensive training package.\nPTK Forensics is available in two versions: \nâ€¢ PTK Forensics free basic edition (50k downloads so far since 2008, including NASA; FBI, Doj)\nâ€¢ PTK Forensics full version  </p>\n\n<p>You Tube Channel: http://youtube.com/dflabs</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0010/0400/100400v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0010/0400/100400v2-max-250x250.png"],[[327,90],"assets/images/resized/0010/0400/100400v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Ceo","person":{"first_name":"Dario","last_name":"Forte","permalink":"dario-forte","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Security USA","person":{"first_name":"Dale","last_name":"Wright","permalink":"dale-wright","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sales Director ","person":{"first_name":"Ivo","last_name":"Simoni","permalink":"ivo-simoni","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Security - United States - ","person":{"first_name":"Dale","last_name":"Wright","permalink":"dale-wright-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Account Executive - Defense and Public Sector","person":{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"Senatore","permalink":"elvira-senatore","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"GRC Solution Manager - USA","person":{"first_name":"Kenneth","last_name":"Hartman","permalink":"kenneth-hartman","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Archer Technologies","permalink":"archer-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/4375/44375v1-max-150x150.png"],[[192,71],"assets/images/resized/0004/4375/44375v1-max-250x250.png"],[[192,71],"assets/images/resized/0004/4375/44375v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Guidance Software","permalink":"guidance-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0009/3936/93936v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,69],"assets/images/resized/0009/3936/93936v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,69],"assets/images/resized/0009/3936/93936v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Accessdata","permalink":"accessdata","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/6917/106917v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0010/6917/106917v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[341,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/6917/106917v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mandiant","permalink":"mandiant","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0014/7942/147942v1-max-150x150.png"],[[247,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/7942/147942v1-max-250x250.png"],[[247,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/7942/147942v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Stroz Friedberg","permalink":"stroz-friedberg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0007/6458/76458v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6458/76458v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,30],"assets/images/resized/0007/6458/76458v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Triliantic","permalink":"triliantic","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kroll Ontrack","permalink":"kroll-ontrack","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0008/8028/88028v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0008/8028/88028v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/8028/88028v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"RSA Security","permalink":"rsa-security","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/8470/88470v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[107,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/8470/88470v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[107,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/8470/88470v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HeadQuarter","address1":"Via delle Macchinette 27","address2":"","zip_code":"26013","city":"Crema (CR)","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"DFLabs announces new features for IncMan.
