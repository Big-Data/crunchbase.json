Making appointments, booking flights, even sending out flowers - we do all this and more.

Tell us what you need to get done and as long as it can \nbe done over the phone or the internet, we can do it.</p>\n\n<p>And, because we have a large team of people who are great at time management and getting things done (even if we do say so ourselves!), once you leave it with Habilis, consider it done.</p>\n\n<p>Tasks suitable for delegation include: \nâ€¢ Minor and repetitive decisions. \nâ€¢ Tasks you are expert in and that others should learn. \nâ€¢ Tasks for which you are least qualified, but that others could learn. \nâ€¢ Tasks you dislike, provided someone else likes them (delegation should not be an excuse to dump unpleasant tasks). \nâ€¢ Tasks that add variety and interest to another personâ€™s role. \nâ€¢ Tasks that will increase the number of people who can perform critical assignments. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,59],"assets/images/resized/0012/0096/120096v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[142,59],"assets/images/resized/0012/0096/120096v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[142,59],"assets/images/resized/0012/0096/120096v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
