Theyâ€™ve performed together for 30 years; skewering the genre of magic, their sold-out audiences, and themselves &#8211; very often all at the same time, within one mind-boggling evening.</p>\n\n<p>September is an exciting month for the duo as they celebrate their fifth year as headliners in their own theater at the Rio All-suite Hotel &amp; Casino, as well as two Emmy nominations for their Showtime series, â€œPenn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!â€</p>\n\n<p>And along the way, Penn &amp; Teller have made the hardest trick of all â€“ a remarkable career that ranges from stage to television to three best-selling books â€“ look easy. And theyâ€™ve done it all on their own, distinctively offbeat terms.</p>\n\n<p>They call themselves â€œa couple of eccentric guys who have learned how to do a few cool things.â€ Since first teaming up in 1975, when they combined Tellerâ€™s silent, occasionally creepy, magic with Pennâ€™s clown college education and juggling expertise, the two have created an entertainment success story that went from the streets to small clubs to national theater tours, and now to a current, multi-year engagement at the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n<p>By 1985, Penn &amp; Teller were receiving rave reviews for their Off Broadway show and Emmy award-winning PBS special, â€œPenn &amp; Teller Go Public.â€ In 1987, they began the first of two successful Broadway runs. Penn &amp; Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise from New York to San Francisco for bringing a fresh slant to an often-tired show business realm.</p>\n\n<p>The first of more than 20 appearances on â€œLate Night with David Lettermanâ€ soon followed, along with appearances on a wide range of television: â€œThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno,â€ â€œMiami Vice,â€ â€œLate Night with Conan Oâ€™Brien,â€ â€œHollywood Squares,â€ â€œThe Today Show,â€ â€œSaturday Night Live,â€ â€œThe Drew Carey Show,â€ â€œ Friends,â€ â€œDharma &amp; Greg,â€ â€œHome Improvement,â€ and one of televisionâ€™s most honored rolls: animated guests on â€œThe Simpsons.â€</p>\n\n<p>They also created their own television projects, including â€œPenn &amp; Tellerâ€™s Sin City Spectacular,â€ â€œPenn &amp; Tellerâ€™s Home Invasion,â€ the Showtime movie â€œPenn &amp; Tellerâ€™s Invisible Thread,â€ and the NBC specials â€œDonâ€™t Try This at Homeâ€ and â€œPenn &amp; Teller: Off The Deep End.â€ Penn &amp; Teller made their big screen debut in Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed and were featured in Walt Disneyâ€™s Fantasia 2000 .</p>\n\n<p>In 2005 Penn &amp; Teller lent their version of the worldâ€™s dirtiest joke to the critically acclaimed documentary, The Aristocrats. The film, produced and co-created by Penn, is now available on DVD.</p>\n\n<p>Penn &amp; Tellerâ€™s understanding of magic and their ability to relate to audiences has also garnered serious academic attention. They serve as Visiting Scholars at MIT, that schoolâ€™s highest honor, and have lectured at Oxford University and the Smithsonian Institution. In 2001, they received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award.</p>\n\n<p>Penn &amp; Teller have written three best-selling books, Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends, How to Play with Your Food, and How to Play in Traffic; and penned pieces in outlets ranging from The New York Times to Playboy.</p>\n\n<p>And after three decades together, there are no signs of slowing down. Their latest project, â€œPenn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!â€ is in its fifth season. The controversial show, which has received 11 Emmy nominations, including two in 2007, and the 2004 WGA award for Outstanding Comedy/Variety Series, tackles the frauds and fakes behind such topics as talking to the dead, alien abductions and feng shui. Earlier this year, Penn served as host of the NBC game show â€œIdentityâ€ and hosted his own nationally radio show on CBS stations across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Penn &amp; Teller appear nightly in Las Vegas at the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/9671/59671v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0005/9671/59671v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,197],"assets/images/resized/0005/9671/59671v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Penn","last_name":"Jillette","permalink":"penn-jillette","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/6395/56395v2-max-150x150.png"],[[210,249],"assets/images/resized/0005/6395/56395v2-max-250x250.png"],[[210,249],"assets/images/resized/0005/6395/56395v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mr.","last_name":"Teller","permalink":"raymond-teller","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/6396/56396v3-max-150x150.png"],[[230,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/6396/56396v3-max-250x250.png"],[[230,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/6396/56396v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
