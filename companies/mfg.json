Manufacturers bid on the requests. MFG.com makes money by selling yearly subscriptions of several thousand dollars each to suppliers who want access to MFG.com&#8217;s community of purchasing managers and engineers at buying companies (who get to use the site for for no charge). The site operates on the notion that in the manufacturing world, suppliers are much more willing to pay a flat fee than to give a cut of each transaction.</p>\n\n<p>Companies as diverse as Black &amp; Decker, Harley Davidson, NCR, and Sara Lee use the site to find suppliers for machined parts, plastic moldings, metal stampings, and fabrications.</p>\n\n<p>The company plans to expand its global presence in China and Europe, and extend its reach to India, Japan and Eastern Europe.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/3049/3049v1-max-150x150.png"],[[203,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/3049/3049v1-max-250x250.png"],[[203,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/3049/3049v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President,
