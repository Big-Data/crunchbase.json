This is to help developers avoid getting negative reviews when they release their apps while instead getting feedback from the targeted users. The developer can also access usage and devices statistics of each user while testing the app. The only thing that the developer needs to do is to download our free SDK from our website and include it in the app using a single line of code, and then upload the application file on our website. </p>\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, we are giving early adopters a chance to get their hands on the latest apps before they become available to the public. Beta users shall also get paid right after they finish testing the app. </p>\n\n<p>While other competitors offer just a single feature; AStarApps will position itself as the only crowdsourcing testing platform with strong feedback tools for beta users. AStarApps will maintain its leadership by continuously adding more features and acquiring a wider user base by supporting more platforms. </p>\n\n<p>To conclude, AStarApps guarantees to turn your app into an AStar app.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Technical Lead","person":{"first_name":"Moataz","last_name":"Soliman","permalink":"moataz-soliman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Business Lead","person":{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"Gabr","permalink":"omar-gabr","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1 Dr. Mohamed Sobhy St., 2nd Floor, Flat 6","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Giza","state_code":null,"country_code":"EGY","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
