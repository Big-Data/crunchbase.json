Revolution searches for businesses that recognize emerging market trends and pursues them, taking risks and ultimately defining their industry.</p>\n\n<p>When we see that industry at large is on the brink of fundamental change, they build pioneering companies that flourish in a new consumer-oriented environment. Revolution scouts for innovative new products and breakthrough ways of doing things that are currently undiscovered, under-financed, or undone&#8211;leaving consumers under-served.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers

engine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0007/9988/79988v2-max-150x150.png"],[[232,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/9988/79988v2-max-250x250.png"],[[232,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/9988/79988v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder,
