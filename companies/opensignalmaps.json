Users can download the free OpenSignalMaps Android app, which acts like a â€œdashboardâ€ for cellular signals by providing information on signal strength, data, speeds, and the cell towers nearby. Users can share the data the app gathers with the OpenSignalMaps website, where the information is processed and visualized on a map. </p>\n\n<p>The website allows users to drill down into the data by network and network type, allowing them to find which network has the best coverage in any location.
