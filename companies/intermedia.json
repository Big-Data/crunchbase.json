Intermedia’s cloud offering is business grade and built specifically for the SMB. Delivered from Intermedia’s seven secure datacenters (6 in the US and 1 in the UK), the company’s Office in the Cloud™ suite combines Intermedia’s proprietary offerings for complete mobile freedom, backup, security, voice and more with Microsoft tools such as Exchange 2010 email, Lync Secure Instant Messaging, and SharePoint document management. The company’s proprietary cloud infrastructure assures high reliability and a certified support team is available around the clock. All Intermedia services are managed from the company’s proprietary HostPilot® Control Panel, providing customers a single point of communications control.  Intermedia also empowers over 10,000  partners – including managed service providers and select Fortune 500 companies – to sell cloud services under their own brand.  Founded in 1995, and acquired in 2011 by private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners, Intermedia was the first to offer hosted Microsoft Exchange business-class cloud email and now has over 400,000 premium hosted Exchange mailboxes under management – more than any other provider. In 2011, Intermedia was voted the #1 hosted Exchange provider by MSExchange.org – the leading organization of Exchange administrators.
