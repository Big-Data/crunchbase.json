These tools are designed for the measurement of dysfunctions of human vision. Orthoptica also provide new relevant tests combined with behavioural analysis and interpretation to improve diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>With headquarters in the TÃªchnopole Brest-Irois area just outside Brest, France, Orthoptica has an international center of excellence in the middle of the knowledge center. The place of our strategic, administrative and business development activities is also home to our research and development site.</p>\n\n<p>Orthoptica is a spin-off of TELECOM Bretagne â€“ one of the most prestigious graduate engineering schools (â€œGrandes Ecolesâ€) in France. TELECOM Bretagne is a public institution, under the aegis of the Ministry for Industry and is a member of the Institut Telecom and the UniversitÃ© europÃ©enne de Bretagne (European University of Brittany). The institute trains future professionals for careers in industry, services and research.</p>\n\n<p>Orthoptica benefits from the knowledge and skills of 3D Fovea. 3D Fovea provides all the components required to be successful: hardware, end users, clinical staff and the presence of content creators. Orthoptica also cooperates with Eyes3Shut, provider of active liquid crystal shutter eyewear for 3D digital projection and displays. Furthermore, our close cooperation with LaTIM, Laboratory of Medical Information Processing, gives us the opportunity to benefit from their extensive expertise within dynamic forms in medical imaging, and indexing and similarities in medical imaging.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0014/2691/142691v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0014/2691/142691v2-max-250x250.png"],[[393,48],"assets/images/resized/0014/2691/142691v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dusan","last_name":"Iorgovan","permalink":"dusan-iorgovan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Magnus","last_name":"Larsson","permalink":"magnus-larsson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/1436/221436v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/1436/221436v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/1436/221436v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"TELECOM Bretagne","permalink":"telecom-bretagne","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"3D Fovea","permalink":"3d-fovea","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Eyes3Shut","permalink":"eyes3shut","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"LaTIM","permalink":"latim","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Pinchro","permalink":"pinchro","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Orthoptica HQ","address1":"Batiment Arago","address2":"305, rue Claude Shannon","zip_code":"29280","city":"PlouzanÃ©","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
