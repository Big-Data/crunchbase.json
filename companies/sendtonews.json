In addition, for sports content, SendtoNews has a proven, performance-based advertising model that is unique and leverages a new inventory of content distributed across all traditional and digital mediums.</p>\n\n<p>SendtoNews  Multimedia Distribution</p>\n\n<p>With SendtoNews, content creators can distribute content more efficiently and cost-effectively to news outlets and, perhaps more importantly, maximize the potential of their stories for news coverage.  SendtoNews was built by news professionals for news professionals and the system automatically optimizes uploaded content for easy integration into newsroom workflow.</p>\n\n<p>Interested newsroom personnel can preview newsworthy stories on SendtoNews, as well as download and manage broadcast-quality versions of any files of interest - all at no charge. They can also distribute these stories and associated multimedia files via their broadcast, print or online news channels as part of daily programming.</p>\n\n<p>The general public can also register as content browsers, which allows them to set up custom feeds, follow content contributors of interest and preview video clips in a larger format.  As a SendtoNews browser, there are many cases where they will have the ability to view stories long before they hit traditional and online news outlets.</p>\n\n<p>A New Approach for Sports Content Advertising</p>\n\n<p>Through the SendtoNews sports video advertising network, we provide major advertisers access to millions of broadcast and online viewer impressions. A media buy on SendtoNews provides “PVR-proof” in-video brand exposure to traditional sports broadcast viewers as well as digitally via corresponding broadcast, print, and radio web properties. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0013/5638/135638v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0013/5638/135638v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0013/5638/135638v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and President","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Bobolo","permalink":"greg-bobolo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/9704/159704v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[145,233],"assets/images/resized/0015/9704/159704v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[145,233],"assets/images/resized/0015/9704/159704v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President, Sales & Strategic Partnerships","person":{"first_name":"Philippe","last_name":"Guay","permalink":"philippe-guay","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.sendtonews.com/index.php?id=220&Rec_ID=89","source_description":"SendtoNews.com Closes $1 Million Angel Round led by ParetoLogic Co-Founders to Fuel Continued North American Expansion","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":6,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/09/sendtonews-raises-3m-venture-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"SendtoNews Raises $3M in Venture Funding","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":13,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"revenuewire","permalink":"revenuewire","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"181 Fremont Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"2659 Douglas Street, 2nd floor","address2":"","zip_code":"V8T 5M2","city":"Victoria","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Sales & Marketing office","address1":"902 Broadway, 4th floor","address2":"","zip_code":"10010","city":"New York ","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/dMaTbxDhSYI?version=3&feature=player_detailpage\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/dMaTbxDhSYI?version=3&feature=player_detailpage\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\"></object>","description":"<p>BCBusiness Award | Congratulations to SendtoNews.com, #4 in 2012&#8217;s Most Innovative Companies in B.C</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/oVJIRpHhRoQ?version=3&feature=player_detailpage\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/oVJIRpHhRoQ?version=3&feature=player_detailpage\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\"></object>","description":"<p>Interview with CEO Greg Bobolo | SendtoNews.com Launches Video Ad Network Service for Sports </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,134],"assets/images/resized/0021/1401/211401v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,224],"assets/images/resized/0021/1401/211401v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,404],"assets/images/resized/0021/1401/211401v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://business.financialpost.com/2011/12/14/quarterly-foodtree-sendtonews-quirky/","title":"Hot Startups of the Week  | Financial Post"},{"external_url":"http://douglasmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16230:douglas-announces-10-to-watch-winners-for-2012&catid=1","title":"SendtoNews.com Named 10 to Watch for 2012 | Douglas Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://techcocktail.com/sendtonews-2012-03","title":"Want More News Coverage For Your Startup?
