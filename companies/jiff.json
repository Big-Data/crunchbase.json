Jiff’s platform allows consumers and health care professionals to build personalized and private communities of care around the digital health interventions they prefer, from wireless sensors to award winning mobile applications. Founded in 2010 in Palo Alto, California, Jiff has assembled a world-class team of healthcare and consumer internet leaders to deploy a integrated suite of elegant, effective and easy to use digital health tools that will redefine consumer and healthcare professionals’ expectations for what can and should be done to improve healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>The first application announced on the Jiff platform, the JiffPad, is an iPad educational tool that makes doctor- patient communications more effective and memorable by transforming conversations and images into videos that patients can reference and share from the privacy of their own homes. JiffPad won the Morgenthaler Ventures’ 2011 DC2VC Start-up showcase and was honored as a finalist at the prestigious TechCrunch Disrupt conference. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0015/4244/154244v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0015/4244/154244v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,321],"assets/images/resized/0015/4244/154244v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Newell","permalink":"derek-newell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Currier","permalink":"james-currier","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0002/2607/22607v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,229],"assets/images/resized/0002/2607/22607v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,413],"assets/images/resized/0002/2607/22607v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President/COO","person":{"first_name":"Phil","last_name":"Carter","permalink":"phil-carter","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Chip","last_name":"Vanek","permalink":"chip-vanek","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0970/150970v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[205,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/0970/150970v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[370,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/0970/150970v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Patent Counsel","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Schox Patent Group","permalink":"schox-plc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0019/1593/191593v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[195,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/1593/191593v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[195,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/1593/191593v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$7.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/622940/jiff-inc-closes-7-5-million-series-a-financing-round-and-appoints-ceo","source_description":"Jiff Inc.
