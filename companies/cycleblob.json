In the original movie, light cycles competed against each other on a flat grid and could only make 90 degree turns while on the grid. Cycleblob takes this idea to the next level and makes the grid a three-dimentional object, floating in space.</p>\n\n<p>Cycleblob is implemented using WebGL and HTML 5 canvas elements and is written completely in JavaScript. WebGL is a port of OpenGL ES 2.0 to JavaScript. </p>\n\n<p>Cycleblob was created by Shy Shalom, an Israely developer, as a personal project for learning WebGL and game engine design and implementation.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0012/9547/129547v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,103],"assets/images/resized/0012/9547/129547v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,185],"assets/images/resized/0012/9547/129547v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Creator","person":{"first_name":"Shy","last_name":"Shalom","permalink":"shy-shalom","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0012/9553/129553v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0012/9553/129553v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0012/9553/129553v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
