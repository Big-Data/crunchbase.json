The German start-up flinc has launched its new service based on a revolutionary concept: Instead of building a new infrastructure, flinc addresses the large number of existing passenger vehicles and aims to increase their occupancy on daily routes. It combines state-of-the art technology with social networking to offer a dynamic, safe and automated service that gets you from A to B.</p>\n\n<p>By using their desktop, smartphone or navigation device flinc users can easily be matched in real-time with members from their trusted social mobility network and share long or short rides. As a world first, flinc is integrated in navigation software.</p>\n\n<p>With flinc, drivers can reduce their mobility costs drastically with a minimum of effort. It only takes one click to start using flinc - to see friends, go shopping or commuting. The integration in navigation software enables the driver to navigate directly to the passenger without a telephone call or text message. For flinc-riders, a mobile phone changes into a real alternative to the privately owned vehicle. Pre-planned or in real-time, flinc can establish a ride and can take passengers from any location (including their front door) to the destination of their choice.</p>\n\n<p>flinc’s route matching algorithm finds riders anywhere along the route of the driver and calculates detour and price. Users can choose whether they want to be matched only with direct contacts, peer groups (companies, universities, others) or with anyone in the network. flinc provides means for electronic payment and user rating. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0016/8852/168852v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0016/8852/168852v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0016/8852/168852v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"First Round Financing","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"flinc","permalink":"flinc"}},{"description":"Germany wide launch","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"flinc","permalink":"flinc"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"http://vimeo.com/26381180","description":"<p>What is flinc? - German with English subtitles</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0016/8854/168854v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0016/8854/168854v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0016/8854/168854v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
