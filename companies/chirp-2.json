Chirp sings information from one device to another.</p>\n\n<p>The app uses special electronic birdsong to ‘chirp’ information over the air to your friends. Users can share photos, webpages, contacts.</p>\n\n<p>Every chirp is a little song that links to anything you want to share. It can quickly send data to multiple devices at once without them needing to be either paired or have a wireless connection.</p>\n\n<p>Chirp solves the problem of having to pair devices to move data, and allows users and broadcasters alike to transmit information to anyone who is in earshot - so a large number of devices can share the same information at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>The platform was developed by Animal Systems, a spin-off business from University College London (UCL) Department of Computer Science.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/0823/220823v2-max-150x150.png"],[[174,250],"assets/images/resized/0022/0823/220823v2-max-250x250.png"],[[313,450],"assets/images/resized/0022/0823/220823v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Steed","permalink":"anthony-steed-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Bergel","permalink":"patrick-bergel","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Argyle House ","address2":"29 - 31 Euston Road,","zip_code":"NW1 2SD","city":"LONDON","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[79,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/0822/220822v2-max-150x150.png"],[[132,250],"assets/images/resized/0022/0822/220822v2-max-250x250.png"],[[237,450],"assets/images/resized/0022/0822/220822v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://vimeo.com/45838932","title":"Introducing Chirp (Vimeo)"},{"external_url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18927928","title":"BBC News: Chirp sends data with digital birdsong"}]}
