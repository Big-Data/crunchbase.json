No more searching through email inboxes, hard drives and paper files when you need to resolve a disagreement or when you need to provide contracts for due diligence.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0013/4055/134055v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0013/4055/134055v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,139],"assets/images/resized/0013/4055/134055v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Ertl","permalink":"martin-ertl","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technical advisor","person":{"first_name":"Zak","last_name":"Greant","permalink":"zak-greant","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/9780/69780v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/9780/69780v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/9780/69780v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Community","person":{"first_name":"Kim","last_name":"Werker","permalink":"kim-werker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/9653/69653v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/9653/69653v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,320],"assets/images/resized/0006/9653/69653v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"C$50k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://bootuplabs.com/portfolio","source_description":"Bootup Labs","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"CAD","funded_year":1000,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Bootup Labs","permalink":"bootup-labs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0002/2598/22598v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0002/2598/22598v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,347],"assets/images/resized/0002/2598/22598v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"200-163 West Hastings St.","address2":"","zip_code":"V6B 1H5","city":"Vancouver, BC","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
