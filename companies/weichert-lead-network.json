In 2002 WLN developed a state-of-the-art customer contact center.  The only one of its kind in the industry, the Weichert customer contact center uses sophisticated technology to deliver responsive personal service to online and 800-number customers seven days a week.  When a customer submits a web inquiry one of WLNâ€™s inside sales consultants typically respond to the customerâ€™s inquiry in less than a minute.  Once connected with the customer the inside sales consultant (ISC) begins gather information from that customer.  One of the first things the ISC will ask for is the area where the customer is looking.  Once they have that information the ISC eill engage the WLN Autodialer.  The Autodialer then begins calling Agents that cover that area.  When the Agent receives the call the computer asks them if they can accept a lead.  Once an Agent accepts the lead the Autodialer stops calling Agents and notifies the ISC.  While this is going on the ISC continues to gather information from the customer.  Once all the info is collected that ISC brings the Agent on the line and introduces them to the customer.  The lead is then sent to the Agent web portal.  The web portal is a customer relationship management system.  All agents are required to update the portal weekly to let WLN know what is going on with each customer.  When a WLN customer purchases or sells a home the Agent pays WLN a 35% referral fee. \n   WLNâ€™s internet marketing strategy has been extremely successful.  Weichert.comâ€™s internet traffic has grown from 9,000 visits a day to over 100,000 visits a day.  Weichert.com is now one of the Top 25 real estate web sites.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,56],"assets/images/resized/0016/2645/162645v2-max-150x150.png"],[[122,56],"assets/images/resized/0016/2645/162645v2-max-250x250.png"],[[122,56],"assets/images/resized/0016/2645/162645v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
