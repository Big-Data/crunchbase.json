They place pre-bids before the QuickPay Event, and during the QuickPay Event they increase their bid(s) iteratively according to their condition status relative to other bids being placed by your other participating suppliers.</p>\n\n<p>WHY:\nBecause you need better investment returns on your short-term cash, improved gross profit margin and a better bottom line. And, because your suppliers need better cash flow and funding sources.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0015/3269/153269v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0015/3269/153269v2-max-250x250.png"],[[288,55],"assets/images/resized/0015/3269/153269v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Taulia","permalink":"taulia-inc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/9216/89216v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0008/9216/89216v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0008/9216/89216v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$9.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/09/pollenware-c2fo-closes-9-1m-venture-capital-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Pollenware (C2FO) Closes $9.1M Venture Capital Funding","raised_amount":9100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":5,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Union Square Ventures ","permalink":"union-square-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[147,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/1028/11028v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,218],"assets/images/resized/0001/1028/11028v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,218],"assets/images/resized/0001/1028/11028v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Office","address1":"2000 Shawnee Mission","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"66205","city":"Mission Woods","state_code":"KS","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Pollenware Announces Close of $3.6 Million Round of Series-A Financing","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":8,"source_url":"http://vformation-sf.com/pollenware-announces-close-of-3-6-million-round-of-series-a-financing","source_text":null,"source_description":"Pollenware Announces Close of $3.6 Million Round of Series-A Financing","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"(C²FO)","permalink":"pollenware"}},{"description":"Pollenware Chooses Tervela to Stream Real-Time Data, Accelerate Time-to-Market","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":9,"source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pollenware-chooses-tervela-to-stream-real-time-data-accelerate-time-to-market-127299828.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Pollenware Chooses Tervela to Stream Real-Time Data, Accelerate Time-to-Market","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"(C²FO)","permalink":"pollenware"}},{"description":"Pollenware Announces 766% Growth in Early Cash Flow Delivery; $368.4 Million First Quarter 2012 Results Exceed Prior Year","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":22,"source_url":"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pollenware-announces-766-growth-in-early-cash-flow-delivery-3684-million-first-quarter-2012-results-exceed-prior-year-2012-05-22","source_text":null,"source_description":"Pollenware Announces 766% Growth in Early Cash Flow Delivery; $368.4 Million First Quarter 2012 Results Exceed Prior Year","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"(C²FO)","permalink":"pollenware"}},{"description":"Pollenware (C2FO) Announces $9.1 Million Funding Round Led by Union Square Ventures ","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"http://c2fo.com/pr_usv_funding.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Pollenware (C2FO) Announces $9.1 Million Funding Round Led by Union Square Ventures ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"(C²FO)","permalink":"pollenware"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
