The end users are given transparent insights into their consumer behaviors. Control signals help them to lower their costs of energy and to improve their personal carbon footprints. </p>\n\n<p>The centerpiece of the GreenPocket technology is the Energy Expert Engine (EEE), which uses algorithmic and heuristic processes to enable the intelligent interpretation of energy and water consumption data. Energy monitoring tools enable this data to be visualized via web portals, wall-mounted devices or iPhone applications in a consumer-friendly and trendsetting way.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0010/4256/104256v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/4256/104256v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,81],"assets/images/resized/0010/4256/104256v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Goette","permalink":"thomas-goette","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0010/5200/105200v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0010/5200/105200v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0010/5200/105200v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Hintermeier","permalink":"alexander-hintermeier","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0010/8667/108667v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,144],"assets/images/resized/0010/8667/108667v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,259],"assets/images/resized/0010/8667/108667v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Senderek","permalink":"jan-senderek","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/7755/137755v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/7755/137755v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/7755/137755v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Opower","permalink":"opower","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0005/6342/56342v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0005/6342/56342v6-max-250x250.png"],[[379,69],"assets/images/resized/0005/6342/56342v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Head of Communications & Business Development","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Torben Pfau","permalink":"torben-pfau","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":8,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"KfW Mittelstandsbank","permalink":"kfw-mittelstandsbank-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0006/1566/61566v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,105],"assets/images/resized/0006/1566/61566v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,105],"assets/images/resized/0006/1566/61566v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Intelligent Venture Capital","permalink":"intelligent-venture-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0009/0470/90470v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/0470/90470v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/0470/90470v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Schwetje Digital","permalink":"schwetje-digital","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"GreenPocket GmbH","address1":"Siegburger StraÃŸe 215","address2":"","zip_code":"50679","city":"Cologne","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"GreenPocket GmbH has successfully completed its Series A financing round.
