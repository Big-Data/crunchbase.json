FaceKoo, its name derived from the words â€œfaceâ€ and â€œcool,â€ offers free membership and a brand new way of meeting friends via a face recognition system. Other applications that are attractive to young users are also integrated â€“ forums, groups, casual games, voting, online pets and war gamesâ€”all easily accessed through one cutting-edge, customizable interface.</p>\n\n<p>FaceKoo is creating revenue through online advertising, sale of digital goods, and through its latest e-commerce operations. Users are rewarded with Koo Dollars&#8211;a virtual currency tied to FaceKoo&#8217;s economic system&#8211;for contributing contents. Over 7 million Koo Dollars are earned and over 6 million Koo Dollars were purchased. However, online advertising is still FaceKoo&#8217;s leading revenue source. Since its niche focus on generation-Y users in urban cities in China, it attracts clients from entertainment industries and online gaming operators. </p>\n\n<p>The Chinese-language-only site targets the huge youth market in the\nworldâ€™s most populous country&#8211;with more than 338 million internet users. FaceKooâ€™s creators are now focusing on converting these young user base into repeat customers on its e-commerce platform. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/7699/27699v1-max-150x150.png"],[[241,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/7699/27699v1-max-250x250.png"],[[241,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/7699/27699v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
