The website is then moved into the â€œupcoming areaâ€. Users will then either vote the website up or down based upon whether or not they like the idea.</p>\n\n<p>When a submission receives enough â€œup votesâ€, it is featured on the front page where it can be viewed by a wider audience giving the site in question a boost of traffic, getting more feedback from Ranqd&#8217;s users. Developers can use these suggestions to improve their product&#8217;s viability, design, functionality and more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/3962/23962v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/3962/23962v2-max-250x250.png"],[[360,140],"assets/images/resized/0002/3962/23962v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
