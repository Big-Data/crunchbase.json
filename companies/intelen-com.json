The company has already won national and World level prizes (OTENET Innovation Award 2006, TOP-5 ALBA in Green Entrepreneurship 2008, top-100 in Europe by Red herring USA, top-100 in world by Guidewire group USA.</p>\n\n<p>Intelen OBJECTIVE: Create Investment Order from Chaotic Digital Raw Data. Create high level decision making and service transition by understanding the hidden value and identify the lost trends on energy and utility measured data.</p>\n\n<p>Our innovative product and solution is web based vertical, complete, personalised energy cloud services. We first use our specific smart cloud meter (xDSL i-box device with embedded metering and OS module to accept and analyse energy and utility  measurements and transmit them over internet using broadband connections) to our cloud warehouses using private encoding for security and privacy. We use alternative Smart Meters as well. Using a powerful middleware full of stream and distributed data\nmining algorithms, we correlate and rank the consumptions and the profiles (advanced clustering in a multidimensional way) and group the customers according to their  nvestment potential, over time (periodicity, elasticity, etc). Then, anonymously we cross-match potential investors in the Energy and Utility domain and correlate the service provision, according to the customer&#8217;s needs in quality and time. This is done over cloud and web service provision by using as means all digital ways (Web Portal, I- phone, Social Nets, Digital TVs, etc). We use special APIs for the transactional services</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/7956/107956v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0010/7956/107956v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,159],"assets/images/resized/0010/7956/107956v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vassilis","last_name":"Nikolopoulos","permalink":"vassilis-nikolopoulos-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/8220/108220v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/8220/108220v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/8220/108220v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Kostas","last_name":"Staikos","permalink":"kostas-staikos","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Intelen Labs","address1":"Ag.
