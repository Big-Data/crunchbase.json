We implemented two algos : the first one is based on the social graph, which is who a user follows and who is following him. It gives insights about what a user might like, and we use is to suggest pins.\nThe second algo is based on a Pin Personality Quizz, which is a quizz on a serie of pairs of Pins for which users have to choose the one he likes most. Based on his answers, we suggest Pinners that are closed.</p>\n\n<p>Pinalyzer also provides a scoring framework to rate influence on Pinterest, between 0 and 100 and based on your capacity to reach people through pins (it&#8217;s pretty hard to reach a score above 80). A user can visualize the history of this score on a graph since he first used of the service. Furthermore, we made a analytics dashboard displaying all recent activity on Pinterest.</p>\n\n<p>Pinalyzer is absolutelly free and will remain so. It is written in Python and uses the Django framework.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Lepage","permalink":"vincent-lepage-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Pintics","permalink":"pintics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0020/1070/201070v1-max-150x150.png"],[[168,111],"assets/images/resized/0020/1070/201070v1-max-250x250.png"],[[168,111],"assets/images/resized/0020/1070/201070v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Pinfluencer","permalink":"pinfluencer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0020/3802/203802v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[155,120],"assets/images/resized/0020/3802/203802v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[155,120],"assets/images/resized/0020/3802/203802v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Pinpuff","permalink":"pinpuff","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0017/5820/175820v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0017/5820/175820v2-max-250x250.png"],[[349,218],"assets/images/resized/0017/5820/175820v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"headquarters","address1":"173 rue de Charenton","address2":"","zip_code":"75012","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
