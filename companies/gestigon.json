Our proven and patented solutions make use of 3D image data that is analyzed in real-time. The action triggered by a gesture can be configured individually, depending on the application. There is no need to rely on the gesture database provided by the OEM. The key features of our software are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>recognition of hand and body gestures</li>\n<li>camera- and  platform independent</li>\n<li>intuitive user interface</li>\n<li>low latency</li>\n<li>generic gesture dictionary included</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our solution addresses consumer electronics, ICT, digital signage and automotive. Due to its architecture as an embedded system it requests significantly less resources and consumes less power. Therefore it is perfectly suitable for any mobile device, where energy and size are relevant factors. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0019/9003/199003v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0019/9003/199003v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0019/9003/199003v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sascha","last_name":"Klement","permalink":"sascha-klement","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CSO","person":{"first_name":"Moritz","last_name":"v.
