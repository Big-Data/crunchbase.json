BoomTimeâ€™s initial services include robust Instant Gift Certificate functionality, Dynamic Websites, and an Appointment Request feature.</p>\n\n<p>Service-based companies have been traditionally under-served on the Internet, since itâ€™s difficult to â€œbuy a massageâ€ over the Internet.  Given that the service-based sector is the largest sector in the US and world economies, and general public acceptance of the Internet for business transactions has steadily increased over the years, SpaBoom is well positioned for growth.</p>\n\n<p>SpaBoom is one of several brands the company uses to reach niche markets.  The other brands are <a href=\"www.coverboom.com\" title=\"CoverBoom\" rel=\"nofollow\">CoverBoom</a> and <a href=\"www.boomtime.com\" title=\"BoomTime\" rel=\"nofollow\">BoomTime</a>, for restaurants and the horizontal market, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>SpaBoom first tested the concept of Instant Gift Certificates with spas and salons, due to the perceived importance of gift certificates (up to 30% of their business) and Internet leads to these organizations.  It was discovered that almost one-half of gift certificate purchasers wait to buy until the last 48 hours of a holiday or event.  Providing an instant gift capability has allowed SpaBoom customers to greatly increase their sales by catering to the last-minute purchaser, where the delays associated with manual fulfillment and/or postal mail is nonexistent.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006, SpaBoom started work on a distribution model, that enables it to sell the Instant Gift Certificates of its clients and push the inventory of Instant Gift Certificates to other distribution networks.  SpaEmergency (www.spaemergency.com) was formed in 2006 to sell Spa and Salon Instant Gift Certificates, and a strategic relationship with Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com) was formed in 2008 for its CoverBoom clients.</p>\n\n<p>By July, 2008, SpaBoom boasts over 10% of the Spa market with 2,600 spas and salons in North America.  It is anticipated that CoverBoom will boast over 1,000 restaurants by the end of 2008.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-150x150.png"],[[214,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-250x250.png"],[[214,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & President","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Bice","permalink":"bill-bice","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Morin","permalink":"ben-morin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/4375/34375v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/4375/34375v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/4375/34375v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2008/01/14/daily4.html?ana=from_rss","source_description":"SpaBoom clients report holiday sales increase","raised_amount":700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Verge Funds","permalink":"verge-funds","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/9829/29829v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/9829/29829v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/9829/29829v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://pdfserver.prweb.com/releases/2007/10/prweb558083.htm","source_description":"SpaFinder Purchases Interest in SpaBoom to Provide New Services, Value for its Spa Marketing Partners","raised_amount":600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"SpaFinder","permalink":"spafinder","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/7304/67304v1-max-150x150.png"],[[241,88],"assets/images/resized/0006/7304/67304v1-max-250x250.png"],[[241,88],"assets/images/resized/0006/7304/67304v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"317 Commercial St. NE","address2":"Suite 300","zip_code":"87102","city":"Albuquerque","state_code":"NM","country_code":"USA","latitude":35.086388,"longitude":-106.646185}],"milestones":[{"description":"Spas Exceed $20M in Online Sales Via SpaBoom's Instant Gift Certificates","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/02/prweb698823.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"Spas Exceed $20M in Online Sales Via SpaBoom's Instant Gift Certificates","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"SpaBoom","permalink":"spaboom"}},{"description":"SpaBoom Spas Break $50M Barrier via Instant Online Gift Certificates","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":23,"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/05/prweb2450414.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"SpaBoom Spas Break $50M Barrier via Instant Online Gift Certificates","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"SpaBoom","permalink":"spaboom"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
