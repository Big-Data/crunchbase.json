The capital will support product development, marketing and sales of Duetto’s suite of cloud applications designed to put real-time analytics in the hands of key decision makers in the travel industry. </p>\n\n<p>Our first product is a SaaS application that helps hotels forecast demand, set prices and manage distribution. We are on schedule to launch the first version to a paying customer in late-summer 2012. </p>\n\n<p>The travel and hospitality sector makes up almost 10% of global GDP and we are excited to work with some of the most respected companies in each of the major travel verticals, including lodging, air and online travel agencies, to optimize demand and maximize profits.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/5814/175814v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/5814/175814v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/5814/175814v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder, Chief Analytics & Product Officer","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Benvenuti","permalink":"marco-benvenuti","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Bosworth","permalink":"patrick-bosworth","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/6618/176618v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/6618/176618v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[432,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/6618/176618v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CoFounder, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Weissman","permalink":"craig-weissman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[48,48],"assets/images/resized/0017/6773/176773v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[48,48],"assets/images/resized/0017/6773/176773v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[48,48],"assets/images/resized/0017/6773/176773v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/duetto-seed-round/","source_description":"Travel Data Startup Duetto Raises $2.1M From Trinity, Marc Benioff, Many More","raised_amount":2100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Scholnick","permalink":"dan-scholnick","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0015/1935/151935v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0015/1935/151935v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0015/1935/151935v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Benchmark","permalink":"benchmark-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0941/10941v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0941/10941v5-max-250x250.png"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0001/0941/10941v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"San Francisco","address1":"649 Mission St, Suite 560","address2":"","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Las Vegas","address1":"2230 Diamond Bar Dr","address2":"","zip_code":"89117","city":"Las Vegas","state_code":"NV","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
