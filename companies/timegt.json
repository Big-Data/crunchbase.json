It will suit a wide range of time management techniques used by different people: Getting Things Done by David Allen, important-urgent method by Dwight D. Eisenhower, First Things First by Stephen Covey, and many others.</p>\n\n<p>TimeGT runs on JavaVM which means it can be used on Windows, Linux and Mac. The application is extensively optimized to match the user experience of native applications.</p>\n\n<p>TimeGT keeps the tasks always up-to-date between any number of user computers. The tasks are mediated through the dedicated secure Sync server.</p>\n\n<p>Tasks are always protected with strong security algorithms when they travel over the internet (RSA of adequate length is used). Nobody can retrieve the data except the user owning the private key and the password.</p>\n\n<p>TimeGT desktop application is available for Free.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/6826/66826v2-max-150x150.png"],[[141,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/6826/66826v2-max-250x250.png"],[[141,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/6826/66826v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ahti","last_name":"Kitsik","permalink":"ahti-kitsik","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"OmniFocus","permalink":"omnifocus","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Things","permalink":"things","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Remember The Milk","permalink":"remember-the-milk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/9117/29117v2-max-150x150.png"],[[188,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/9117/29117v2-max-250x250.png"],[[188,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/9117/29117v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Mustamae tee 16","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Tallinn","state_code":null,"country_code":"EST","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/LvVQ3cABT8M&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/LvVQ3cABT8M&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Getting Started with TimeGT</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0006/6825/66825v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0006/6825/66825v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,157],"assets/images/resized/0006/6825/66825v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
