PTs can film their own personalized exercise videos and upload them to RevoPT on one device&#8211;their smartphone. They can build and organize their own personal library and assign video to patients to build truly individualized home exercise programs.</p>\n\n<p>Patients access the videos assigned to them on any desktop or mobile device. They are also held accountable by a tracking system that sends them reminders, logs their exercise completion, and asks them for subjective data about their progress with rehabilitation.  All of this information is relayed to their physical therapist so that adjustments can be made to the program accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The company is currently in Beta testing and was chosen as one of nine companies to participate in the StartFast Venture Accelerator Program.  The program takes place from May 14-August 16 in Syracuse, NY this summer.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0019/2925/192925v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0019/2925/192925v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0019/2925/192925v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Lee","permalink":"justin-lee-4","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, COO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Wehrhahn","permalink":"michael-wehrhahn","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Lee","permalink":"justin-lee","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Lam","permalink":"steven-lam","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$12k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.startfast.net","source_description":"StartFast Venture Accelerator","raised_amount":12000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"StartFast Venture Accelerator","permalink":"startfast-venture-accelerator-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2569/202569v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2569/202569v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2569/202569v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Onodaga Tower","address1":"125 E Jefferson St.","address2":"","zip_code":"13202","city":"Syracuse","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[76,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/2923/192923v2-max-150x150.png"],[[126,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/2923/192923v2-max-250x250.png"],[[228,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/2923/192923v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[89,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/2924/192924v2-max-150x150.png"],[[148,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/2924/192924v2-max-250x250.png"],[[267,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/2924/192924v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://startfast.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Press-Release-StartFast-Announces-2012-Teams-FINAL1.pdf","title":"StartFast Press Release"},{"external_url":"http://centralny.ynn.com/content/top_stories/585487/100-days-for-nine-startups-to-get-off-the-ground/","title":"100 days for nine startups to get off the ground"}]}
