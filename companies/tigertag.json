TigerTag helps recover lost items by providing unique ID&#8217;s on the tag affixed to a personal device, making it identifiable to a potential finder. </p>\n\n<p>If someone finds your item, they&#8217;re directed to the TigerTag website, which triggers an immediate e-mail to you. At that point, you can connect directly with them, or have us retrieve the item and ship it directly to you.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important that you keep your information up to date so we can find you. Just three easy steps, and you&#8217;re covered:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Apply the TigerTag to your item.</p>\n\n<p>2 - Activate the tag by filling out the form at the TigerTag website.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0006/4064/64064v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/4064/64064v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/4064/64064v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"Escarlate","permalink":"alberto-escarlate","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0006/3890/63890v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0006/3890/63890v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0006/3890/63890v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Levine","permalink":"eric-levine-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Lagier","permalink":"eric-lagier","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6245/146245v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/6245/146245v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/6245/146245v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New York","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Copenhagen","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"DNK","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"TigerTag is selected for the first installment of the Open Angel Forum in Los Angeles","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"TigerTag","permalink":"tigertag"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/0B6CpJeUnrs&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/0B6CpJeUnrs&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Eric Lager interview with Jason Calacanis at This Week In Startups</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/4065/64065v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0006/4065/64065v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,395],"assets/images/resized/0006/4065/64065v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.tigertag.com","title":"TigerTag"},{"external_url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/08/AR2010010801509.html","title":"Coming & Going: TigerTag aims to reconnect lost items with their owners"}]}
