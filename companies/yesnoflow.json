They can then post their own â€˜yes or noâ€™ question of up to 200 characters for others to vote on, as well as having the option to vote and comment on other userâ€™s questions.</p>\n\n<p>As well as appearing on the userâ€™s profile, the question is added to the â€˜flowâ€™ â€“ the stream of questions on the home page. Here it has a total showing how many people have voted and what percentage say â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™. </p>\n\n<p>The more interest the question provokes, the more points are gained, allowing users unlock achievements. Questions can be anything from &#8216;Should I marry my girlfriend of 3 years?&#8217; to &#8216;Is religion a good thing?&#8217; </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0012/7317/127317v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0012/7317/127317v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,129],"assets/images/resized/0012/7317/127317v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
