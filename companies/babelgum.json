Over 2 million people have downloaded the Babelgum mobile applications and watched videos on them.</p>\n\n<p>DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY</p>\n\n<p>In Europe, Babelgum made a strategic agreement with Vodafone to launch a mobile service that allows users to watch videos for free also over 3G networks (Vodafone supports marketing campaigns through SMS and other PR activities targeting their Customer Base). Babelgum is also seeking selected strategic partnerships in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>BABELGUMâ€™S EDITORIAL APPROACH TO CONTENT</p>\n\n<p>Positioned between user generated video hubs and network TV-oriented destinations, Babelgum has a unique editorial approach which focuses on the third part of the ecosystem: innovative, professionally produced content on very specific passions curated by experts in their fields. </p>\n\n<p>The editorial team is driven by professional publishers who scout and select programming for the following channels: Music, Comedy, Film, Our Earth (dedicated to nature and the environment) and Metropolis (all about urban culture and trends). </p>\n\n<p>The mobile and web platforms are integrated functionally and graphically and complement each other, although mobile programming is more carefully tailored to local markets, based on research into national tastes and viewing habits. </p>\n\n<p>Babelgumâ€™s content comprises independent and mainstream programming as well as exclusive original productions.</p>\n\n<p>LIST OF MAIN CONTENT PROVIDERS:</p>\n\n<p>Babelgumâ€™s content partners include, among others, EMI, Sony BMG, the New York Times, PBS, BBC, VBS, Lonely Planet, Coolhunting, National Geographic, Funny or Die, T5M, Shine Limited, Cinetic Rights Management, Content Republic, Gong Anime, The Workbook Project, Cinelan, Power to the Pixel and Off the Fence as well as the Seattle, Encounters, Los Angeles, and Hamptons film festivals.</p>\n\n<p>ONLINE VIDEO COMPETITIONS:</p>\n\n<p>The company has also set up a series of online contests to nurture independent film, music and art talent: the Babelgum Online Film Festival, the Babelgum Music Video Awards and the Babelgum Metropolis Art Prize chaired respectively by Spike Lee, Michel Gondry and Isabella Rossellini.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/7738/67738v2-max-150x150.png"],[[135,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/7738/67738v2-max-250x250.png"],[[135,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/7738/67738v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Babelgum","permalink":"babelgum","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Valerio","last_name":"Zingarelli","permalink":"valerio-zingarelli","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0007/3085/73085v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0007/3085/73085v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0007/3085/73085v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mallku","last_name":"Caballero","permalink":"mallku-caballero","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Lumer","permalink":"erik-lumer","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Engineering
