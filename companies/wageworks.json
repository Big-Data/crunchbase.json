WageWorks is riding a trend where employers are giving their employees more benefit options and need to explain and administer these options - which it outsourced to WageWorks. The company operates the site ForYourFinancialHealth.com to make this happen. WageWorks reported revenues of $14.4M in 2004 and a 2100% revenue growth rate between 2001 and 2004. It has made several recent acquisitions: HCap Strategies, FBD Consulting, Sodexho Pass, and FlexBen. Clients include over 75 of the Fortune 500 including: Bank of America, The Bank of New York, Leggett &amp; Platt, Limited Brands, Pfizer, Tribune Company, Union Pacific, and The US Postal Service.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0003/2485/32485v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/2485/32485v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[269,85],"assets/images/resized/0003/2485/32485v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$20M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1158863/000118143110002126/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D","raised_amount":20000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":7,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"1100 Park Place, 4th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"94403","city":"San Mateo","state_code":"NJ","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.458501,"longitude":-122.432846}],"milestones":[{"description":"WageWorks Estimates IPO Terms Giving It $325M Capitalization","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":20,"source_url":"https://www.fis.dowjones.com/article.aspx?ProductIDFromApplication=32&aid=DJFVW00020110719e77k000xd&r=Rss&s=DJFVW","source_text":"","source_description":"WageWorks Estimates IPO Terms Giving It $325M Capitalization","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"WageWorks ","permalink":"wageworks"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
