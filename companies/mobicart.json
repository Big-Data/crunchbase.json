To date, it has secured just under $1million investment and achieved significant traction powering over 12,000 merchants.</p>\n\n<p>SECPay founder Mark Feingold, who sold his online payment gateway to PayPoint for a reported $20million in 2007, and Stephen Lusty, a former senior executive at Google, Nortel and Felxtronics, are the latest to invest and join the board.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Publications
