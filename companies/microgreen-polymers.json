By exposing the saturated plastic to enough heat to soften it rather than melt it, the gas will nucleate into billions of bubbles, and be held in place by the solid state plastic.</p>\n\n<p>Eight years ago our founders realized that applying this technology to the most recycled plastic on earth would result in dramatic impacts in the sustainability.  On September 11, 2002, MicroGREEN Polymers was incorporated in Washington State.</p>\n\n<p>The &#8220;Micro&#8221; part of our name is an abbreviation of microcellular technology, while &#8220;green&#8221; connotes the eco-friendly nature of that technology.  When the company was formed, the founders, Greg Branch and Krishna Nadella, were working on their PhDs at the University of Washington in the field of microcellular polymer manufacturing.  After forming MicroGREEN, they continued to focus on commercializing this technology that they had first experimented with as students and negotiated with the University of Washington to license existing patents.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0011/7967/117967v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,121],"assets/images/resized/0011/7967/117967v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,121],"assets/images/resized/0011/7967/117967v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
