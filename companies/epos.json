The company partners with OEMs, ODMs, distributors and retailers to bring next-generation, positioning-based consumer electronics products to the PC peripheral, notebook and touch-screen markets. </p>\n\n<p>EPOS-enabled &#8216;Digital Pen &amp; Mouse&#8217;, &#8216;Digital Pen &amp; USB Flash Drive&#8217; and &#8216;Wired Digital Pen&#8217; products are marketed throughout the US and Europe. In addition, EPOS products are also sold as complementary hardware for various laptops. </p>\n\n<p>EPOS technology is based on the transmission of ultrasonic acoustic waves between two or more devices via a â€œTransmitterâ€ and a â€œReceiverâ€. The transmitter, embedded in a device such as a pen, sends constant acoustic signals to a receiver. The receiver uses the signals to measure the distance and position of the wireless device. Small in size and low in cost, EPOS technology easily integrates into almost any consumer electronics product and requires only minimal battery consumption, making the range of potential product possibilities extensive. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/5124/35124v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[184,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/5124/35124v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[184,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/5124/35124v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO ","person":{"first_name":"Oded","last_name":"Turbahn","permalink":"oded-turbahn","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"Altman","permalink":"nathan-altman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Accounting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Guberman","permalink":"guberman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/1554/41554v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0004/1554/41554v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,106],"assets/images/resized/0004/1554/41554v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$15.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2006/11/israeli_digital.html","source_description":"Israeli Digital Pen Co.
