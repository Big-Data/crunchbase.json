He decided to create a business that would cut-out the middleman and offer better value for used video games and soon thereafter Goozex was born.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, Goozex is a peer to peer video game trading platform that allows users to trade their games for points which they can then use to purchase other games. Users pay a $1 trade fee to purchase a game, but selling games is free.
