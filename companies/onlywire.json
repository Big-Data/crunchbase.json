These services are being rolled out with submission-based pricing for clients who require high volume usage.  Both products will allow for increased API submissions (i.e. posts) and OnlyWire Enterprise is geared towards companies that require the ability to set up their end-customers with accounts and track overall system performance.</p>\n\n<p>The Enterprise solution includes new levels of service which includes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A System Administrator (â€œAdminâ€).</li>\n<li>Unlimited User Accounts.</li>\n<li>User and System Analytics.</li>\n<li>Increased Support.</li>\n<li>Set up and Training.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>OnlyWire is also adding a Finalization service that will allow any submissions requiring Human Intervention (i.e. Captcha) to be handled by our support team.  This means that all service providers that require finalization for user submissions (e.g. Digg, Reddit, etc.) will be submitted and authenticated through the Captcha process by OnlyWire as part of this additional monthly fee.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about OnlyWire, please visit:\nwww.OnlyWire.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/2287/22287v5-max-150x150.png"],[[120,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/2287/22287v5-max-250x250.png"],[[120,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/2287/22287v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Wall","permalink":"derek-wall","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/7454/167454v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/7454/167454v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,380],"assets/images/resized/0016/7454/167454v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080715/nytu001a.html","source_description":"Snipitron Acquires OnlyWire.Com","acquired_year":2008,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":17,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Snipitron","permalink":"snipitron","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/2286/22286v1-max-150x150.png"],[[152,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/2286/22286v1-max-250x250.png"],[[152,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/2286/22286v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
