SalesClic facilitates their implementation: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>sales pipeline stages are clearly visible and optimizable; </li>\n<li>key indicators are displayed directly in the pipeline; </li>\n<li>sales reps are guided by their historical performance. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Optimization opportunities emerge right from the start. </p>\n\n<p>FORECASTING </p>\n\n<p>Forecasts based on traditional B2B concepts (quota, commit, best case, weighted amount of opportunities) are notoriously unreliable. </p>\n\n<p>SalesClic improves B2B forecasts through the careful analysis of pipeline dynamics (including the calculation of your &#8220;ideal pipeline&#8221;) and the ability to build and save detailed sales simulations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0016/8939/168939v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,108],"assets/images/resized/0016/8939/168939v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,195],"assets/images/resized/0016/8939/168939v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Arthur Cox","permalink":"arthur-cox","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"William Fry","permalink":"william-fry","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Ernst & Young","permalink":"ernst-young","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬1.3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1300000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Private","last_name":"Investor","permalink":"private-investor-3","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Dublin","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"IRL","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"London","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Paris","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
