It was first established with the School of Education, and currently comprehends five schools, distributed throughout several towns of the Leiria district. During these years, the number of students and teachers at the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria has grown considerably. The institution currently has about 600 teachers (many of them holding Master and Doctorate degrees), 10,000 students and modern facilities and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Aimed at delivering quality teaching, the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria has made an investment effort, which makes it a national example in terms of higher education, with a strong influence in the region.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas most institutions deal with a shortage of students, the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria is proud to register the opposite tendency and exhibits a high employment rate amongst its graduates.</p>\n\n<p>Among the measures that contribute to a better performance of the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria in carrying out its mission - â€œto train appropriately according to the legitimate expectations of the civil society, the students and their familiesâ€ - we find the partnerships with national and international educational and research institutions, the enhancement of our teaching staff&#8217;s qualifications, the improvement of buildings and premises and a greater demand in the students&#8217; entry requirements.</p>\n\n<p>As a response to the demand and quality imposed by the labour market, all the initiatives that promote direct contact with the world of labour have played an important part. Such initiatives include practical lessons held in companies or conducted by professionals, periodic and final internships and enterprise visits. At a time of redefinition and retraction of higher education, the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria is proud to be growing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0003/3135/33135v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0003/3135/33135v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,296],"assets/images/resized/0003/3135/33135v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"IPL","address1":"Headquarters","address2":"Rua General Norton de Matos","zip_code":"2411-901","city":"Leiria","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"ESE","address1":"Campus 1","address2":"Rua Dr. JoÃ£o Soares","zip_code":"2411-901","city":"Leiria","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"ESTG","address1":"Campus 2","address2":"Morro do Lena - Alto do Vieiro","zip_code":"2411-901","city":"Leiria","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"ESAD","address1":"Campus 3","address2":"Rua Isidoro InÃ¡cio Alves de Carvalho","zip_code":"2504 - 917","city":"Caldas da Rainha","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"ESTM","address1":"Campus 4","address2":"SantuÃ¡rio Nossa Senhora dos RemÃ©dios","zip_code":"2524 - 909","city":"Peniche","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"ESS","address1":"Campus 2","address2":"Morro do Lena - Alto do Vieiro","zip_code":"2411- 901","city":"Leiria","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Other Organic Units","address1":"Campus 5","address2":"Rua das Olhalvas","zip_code":"2414 - 016","city":"Leiria","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ipleiria.pt/","title":"POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE OF LEIRIA (IPL)"},{"external_url":"http://www.esel.ipleiria.pt/","title":"SCHOOL OF EDUCATION (LEIRIA)"},{"external_url":"http://www.estg.ipleiria.pt/","title":"SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT (LEIRIA)"},{"external_url":"http://www.esad.ipleiria.pt/","title":"SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS AND DESIGN (CALDAS DA RAINHA)"},{"external_url":"http://www.estm.ipleiria.pt/index.php?id=67","title":"SCHOOL OF MARITIME TECHNOLOGY (PENICHE)"},{"external_url":"http://www.esslei.ipleiria.pt/","title":"SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES (LEIRIA)"},{"external_url":"http://ued.ipleiria.pt","title":"Distance Learning Unit (UED)"}]}
