Their service basically allows users to look up which stores are open and when.</p>\n\n<p>As of early 2008, the company primarily has a Web application which shows users nearby stores and their operating hours. Users just type in the name of the store they&#8217;re looking for and their location. Results are displayed on a Google Map mashup, with listing of stores, their hours of operation, their phone numbers and their distance from the city center appearing in a left-hand column.</p>\n\n<p>WhatsOpen also says offers an iPhone application. But sources say that there is a lot more to expect from WhatsOpen. They have supposedly also written the first wireless app for Google&#8217;s new Android mobile operating system. </p>\n\n<p>Keep your eye out for WhatsOpen&#8217;s social networking applications; we would expect users to see see what places are open while on a social network like Facebook or Myspace.</p>\n\n<p>From what we know, WhatsOpen is self-funded.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/2968/2968v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0000/2968/2968v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0000/2968/2968v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"WhatsOpen","permalink":"whatsopen","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Schultz","permalink":"jason-schultz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[139,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/3508/83508v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[232,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/3508/83508v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[313,336],"assets/images/resized/0008/3508/83508v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jason Schultz (www.Jason.me)</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$100k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":20,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Ambistia Ventures","permalink":"ambistia-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/0569/20569v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0002/0569/20569v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0002/0569/20569v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.269175,"longitude":-119.306607}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
