In 2008, more than $21 billion was spent on online marketing to drive traffic to online merchant Websites with mechanisms such as display ads, search optimization, lead generation, and affiliate marketing.  However, conversion rates of visitors to actual sales on the Website averaged only 2-3%.  Over 97% of Website visitors dropped off without making a purchase.  </p>\n\n<p>Runa allows online merchants to more than double the conversion rate of visitors.  A one percentage point increase in conversions from visitors to sales among all the existing online merchants is equivalent to them spending approximately an additional $7 billion on online advertising at current efficiencies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0009/8241/98241v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/8241/98241v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/8241/98241v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO / Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"J.
