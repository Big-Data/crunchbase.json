Their SILVIA (Symbolically Isolated, Linguistically Variable, Intelligence Algorithms) platform is a complete systemÂ for the development and deployment of intelligent applications to almost any platform, with a technological core that allowsÂ humans to interact with computers inÂ completely natural and intuitive ways. The platform helps derive context and meaning from user inputs, via speech  text, or other methods, so you can communicate with the platform as if it were another person.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0000/0304/304v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0000/0304/304v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[440,268],"assets/images/resized/0000/0304/304v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SILVIA","permalink":"silvia","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Leslie","last_name":"Spring","permalink":"leslie-spring","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"john-chen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0005/3909/53909v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0005/3909/53909v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0005/3909/53909v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Mimi","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"mimi-chen","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"California Office","address1":"15303 Ventura Blvd., 9th Floor ","address2":"","zip_code":"91403","city":"Sherman Oaks","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.293952,"longitude":-118.507635}],"milestones":[{"description":"Cognitive Code is Approved Vendor for Northrop Grumman ","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3993334.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"Cognitive Code is Approved Vendor for Northrop Grumman ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Cognitive Code","permalink":"cognitivecode"}},{"description":"Cognitive Code is Approved Vendor for Northrop Grumman ","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3993334.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3993334.htm","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Cognitive Code","permalink":"cognitivecode"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
