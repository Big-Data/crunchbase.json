The site provides news, player alerts, insider advice, and forums in addition to standard social networking features (friends, pictures, blogs), and also aggregates users&#8217; fantasy sports teams. While some users will no doubt like the social networking features and the ability to converse with other fans in an open forum on fantasy sports, perhaps the most useful feature of the site for users is the ability to access all their fantasy sports teams from one location- the Fantasy Sports Dashboard. Users can update lineups and see those changes reflected in the hosting site, automate roster changes, and access and change rosters over wireless devices.</p>\n\n<p>Screaming Sports also offers a Facebook application, allowing users to manage their fantasy teams from their Facebook accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Also in the realm of fantasy sports startups are <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/draftmix\" title=\"DraftMix\">DraftMix</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fleaflicker\" title=\"Fleaflicker\">Fleaflicker</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/8062/38062v1-max-150x150.png"],[[232,156],"assets/images/resized/0003/8062/38062v1-max-250x250.png"],[[232,156],"assets/images/resized/0003/8062/38062v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Fantasy Sports Dashboard","permalink":"fantasy-sports-dashboard","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Alec","last_name":"Peters","permalink":"alec-peters","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Shawn","last_name":"Haynie","permalink":"shawn-haynie","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Web Designer","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Martin","permalink":"stephen-martin","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"DraftMix","permalink":"draftmix","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/1822/1822v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[116,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/1822/1822v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[116,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/1822/1822v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Fleaflicker","permalink":"fleaflicker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0000/1879/1879v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[210,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1879/1879v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[210,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1879/1879v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.25M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://screamingsports.com/press-releases/07-20-2007.aspx","source_description":"","raised_amount":1250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mangrove Capital Partners","permalink":"mangrove-capital-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/2027/22027v1-max-150x150.png"],[[158,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/2027/22027v1-max-250x250.png"],[[158,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/2027/22027v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"400 Perimeter Center Terrace N","address2":"Suite 900","zip_code":"30346","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":33.930228,"longitude":-84.337686}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0003/8064/38064v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0003/8064/38064v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0003/8064/38064v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
