In August 2010, shopkick launched the first mobile application that hands consumers rewards and exclusive deals at shopkick&#8217;s national retail partners simply for walking into thousands of stores and malls. shopkick created a new location technology that allows the app to verify the user is actually present inside a store (GPS is too inaccurate for that). shopkick broadcasts an inaudible audio signal at a high-pitch frequency that can be picked up by a smartphone&#8217;s microphone, either through the store&#8217;s existing music system or through a small transmitter. The shopkick app decodes the signal and the user receives shopkick&#8217;s  universal reward currency called &#8220;kicks.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Like advertisers pay Google for click traffic in the online world, they can pay shopkick for foot traffic in the real world.
