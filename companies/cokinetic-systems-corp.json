It has patented the process of using XML to describe the application ecosystem. The underlying software is called NewGoo, and is also called AirPlay when used in airline inflight entertainment systems. </p>\n\n<p>NewGoo is a very thin client that can run on multiple operating systems, such as Linux, Unix, and Windows. It can be used either to replace current browsers, or as a plug-in. NewGoo provides a means for rendering XML data streams into very interesting and attractive web pages or screen displays (as in the case of inflight entertainment systems). </p>\n\n<p>Some of the key differences between NewGoo and other RIA software is that it provides a rich and secure transactional capability, and it is extremely stable over time. The other key difference is that NewGoo is very easy to code and does not require the deep technology experience that some other RIA languages demand. </p>\n\n<p>NewGoo is the software that powers the inflight entertainment system that was just named &#8220;best in the world&#8221;.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0004/0995/40995v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/0995/40995v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/0995/40995v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"NewGoo","permalink":"newgoo","image":null},{"name":"AirPlay","permalink":"airplay","image":null},{"name":"AirDo","permalink":"airdo","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kristan","last_name":"Stevens","permalink":"kristan-stevens","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Shulman","permalink":"david-shulman","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"EVP Head of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"Strout","permalink":"ronald-strout","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Adobe Systems","permalink":"adobe-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[56,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/3687/13687v1-max-150x150.png"],[[56,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/3687/13687v1-max-250x250.png"],[[56,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/3687/13687v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"44 South Broadway","address2":"2nd Floor","zip_code":"10601","city":"White Plains","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.03083,"longitude":-73.761171}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/0996/40996v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/0996/40996v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0004/0996/40996v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
