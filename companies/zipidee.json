The service shut down and their website currently returns a servcie error. </p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first, yet it will offer you the most control over the pricing and distribution of your assets. Like music aggregator and white label service <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/snocap\" title=\"Snocap\">Snocap</a>, Zipidee allows you to create your own store front in the form of a widget placed on your website.  You&#8217;ll be able to sell anything audio or video (Snocap allows only audio) off your site for any price you specify with or without Zipidee&#8217;s proprietary DRM.</p>\n\n<p>Your customers will be able to buy downloads or &#8220;rent&#8221; them through streams.  Zipidee provides an analytics dashboard for users which provides sales data to help you adjust prices. The company will earn revenue by charging $1 per listing and taking a 20% cut on most items.</p>\n\n<p>Zipidee&#8217;s competitors are payloadz, tradebits, eJunkie, <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/edgeio\" title=\"Edgeio\">Edgeio</a> and Ebay to a lesser degree. It has secured an undisclosed amount of funding in a Series A round.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/1162/1162v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,84],"assets/images/resized/0000/1162/1162v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,84],"assets/images/resized/0000/1162/1162v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Zipidee","permalink":"zipidee","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"henry-wong","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Edgeio","permalink":"edgeio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/3517/3517v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0000/3517/3517v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[255,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/3517/3517v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/10/14/online-digital-marketplace-zipidee-launches-public-beta-raises-funding/","source_description":"Online digital marketplace Zipidee launches public beta, raises funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Khalda Development","permalink":"khalda-development","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Novus Ventures","permalink":"novus-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/9544/29544v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/9544/29544v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/9544/29544v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The Individuals' Venture Fund","permalink":"the-individuals-venture-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0008/0161/80161v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0008/0161/80161v1-max-250x250.png"],[[389,36],"assets/images/resized/0008/0161/80161v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style=\"width:320px;\"><div style=\"background-color:#dedede;width:320px;text-align:center;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:5px;margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-01-18-zipidees-henry-wong-wants-to-help-self-help-experts\" target=\"_blank\">See this video on <span style=\"color:#38538e;font-weight: bold;\">Vator</span><span style=\"color:#50a756;font-weight: bold;\">.tv</span>&nbsp;&raquo;</a></div><embed src=\"http://www.vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=1787_Zipidee-Interview-11.flv&b=2&i=1787&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-01-18-zipidees-henry-wong-wants-to-help-self-help-experts\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></div>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
