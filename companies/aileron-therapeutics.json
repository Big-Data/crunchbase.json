Stapled Peptides represent the first general solution, or &#8220;scaffold&#8221; for modulating intracellular protein-protein interactions that are critical control points to nearly all functions of a cell. The ability to target and regulate these control points affords the unique opportunity to exploit potentially thousands of currently &#8220;undruggable&#8221; cellular targets with applications in all human diseases.</p>\n\n<p>Aileronâ€™s proprietary technology locks peptides into their biologically active shape, mimicking the structures found in nature, and ultimately endows the peptide with unique properties, including efficient cell penetration, high affinity binding to large target protein surfaces and excellent stability within the body.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/8789/48789v1-max-150x150.png"],[[153,89],"assets/images/resized/0004/8789/48789v1-max-250x250.png"],[[153,89],"assets/images/resized/0004/8789/48789v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"A.
