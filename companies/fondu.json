When a review receives enough &#8220;cheers&#8221; and comments from other users, it becomes a popular review that can be viewed by location or globally.</p>\n\n<p>After launching SpotOn as an NYC only beta at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC in May, the team spent a lot of time refining the recommendation engine and testing with users. Based on extensive user feedback, the team decided to evolve their product into a social network for bite-sized reviews and renamed the company to Fondu.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0016/3499/163499v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0016/3499/163499v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,173],"assets/images/resized/0016/3499/163499v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Gauri","last_name":"Manglik","permalink":"gauri-manglik","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,134],"assets/images/resized/0012/8735/128735v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,224],"assets/images/resized/0012/8735/128735v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[376,337],"assets/images/resized/0012/8735/128735v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Lewis","permalink":"mike-lewis-5","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0010/3479/103479v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,235],"assets/images/resized/0010/3479/103479v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,424],"assets/images/resized/0010/3479/103479v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Algorithm Lead","person":{"first_name":"Orion","last_name":"Burt","permalink":"orion-burt","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8513/128513v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/8513/128513v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[280,280],"assets/images/resized/0012/8513/128513v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Angel Investor","person":{"first_name":"Nihal","last_name":"Mehta","permalink":"nihal-mehta","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/8203/88203v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/8203/88203v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[315,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/8203/88203v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$575k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/22/fondu/","source_description":"Fondu Is Foursquare For Foodies","raised_amount":575000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"ENIAC Ventures","permalink":"eniac-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,55],"assets/images/resized/0011/5963/115963v3-max-150x150.png"],[[142,55],"assets/images/resized/0011/5963/115963v3-max-250x250.png"],[[142,55],"assets/images/resized/0011/5963/115963v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Harbor Road Ventures","permalink":"harbor-road-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"NYU Innovation Venture Fund","permalink":"nyu-innovation-venture-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,111],"assets/images/resized/0017/3043/173043v2-max-150x150.png"],[[75,111],"assets/images/resized/0017/3043/173043v2-max-250x250.png"],[[75,111],"assets/images/resized/0017/3043/173043v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Blazer Ventures","permalink":"blazer-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0018/8435/188435v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,33],"assets/images/resized/0018/8435/188435v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,60],"assets/images/resized/0018/8435/188435v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"Lenihan","permalink":"lawrence-d-lenihan-jr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1102/171102v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1102/171102v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[363,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1102/171102v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Zach","last_name":"Aarons","permalink":"zach-aarons","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Fondu HQ","address1":"37 W. 28th St","address2":"5th floor","zip_code":"10001","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0014/2023/142023v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/2023/142023v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0014/2023/142023v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
