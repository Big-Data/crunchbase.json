Whether a merchant has a unique internal infrastructure that requires additional technical resources or perhaps a merchant is entering an emerging market such as selling virtual gift applications and require additional risk/fraud management, we will allocate the resources on our end to ensure a successful launch. </p>\n\n<p>Our expertise is multi-channel merchants including internet companies/retailers who sell products, subscriptions or digital content as well as call center and catalog merchants. </p>\n\n<p>Our direct merchant account and gateway platform is easily integrated and provides all of the components needed to process and settle transactions under one roof including front-end(merchant accounts in the US, Canada and EU) and back-end processing functions and connectivity (our top shelf gateway), real time reporting, and a completely scalable and customizable system. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Optimal Payments is very comfortable working with companies who are entering into emerging markets such as social network applications, virtual gifting and social game as well as the less traditional verticals. It&#8217;s often difficult to find a bank that understands these unique billing models. Without the level of comfort, banks typically A. impose higher processing fees B. Freeze funds if you grow too quickly c. Not have the proper tools in place to help you mitigate fraud. With that being said, our company has over thirteen years experience working with online (non-traditional) merchants from the largest subscription based websites to some of the larger well-known retailers. </p>\n\n<p>Our payment processing gateway is scalable for steady or rapid growth and has every type of reporting and data you will ever need to run your business. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Research & Development","person":{"first_name":"Stacy","last_name":"Young","permalink":"stacy-young","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5468/105468v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5468/105468v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5468/105468v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2010/11/patricia-weber-vp-of-sales-optimal-payments-optimal-paymentsa-good-fit-for-online-dating.html","title":"VP Sales Patricia Weber Interview  11/10"},{"external_url":"http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2010/11/patricia-weber-vp-of-sales-optimal-payments-optimal-paymentsa-good-fit-for-online-dating.html","title":"VP Sales Patricia Weber Interview  11/10"}]}
