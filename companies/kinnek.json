They do not have the same resources as a large corporation or institution to maintain large procurement teams and implement enterprise-level procurement platforms.  However, they also do not have the luxury of easily finding quotes online for their purchases- commercial-quantity pricing and pricing on customized orders are difficult to find.</p>\n\n<p>Kinnek enables these small businesses to request quotes from many suppliers using a single request, for any major purchase.  The process of requesting quotes, submitting quotes, and the resulting interaction between SMBs and their suppliers is all handled online through the Kinnek platform.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Karthik","last_name":"Sridharan","permalink":"karthik-sridharan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,82],"assets/images/resized/0022/1148/221148v2-max-150x150.png"],[[85,82],"assets/images/resized/0022/1148/221148v2-max-250x250.png"],[[85,82],"assets/images/resized/0022/1148/221148v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Ma","permalink":"rui-ma","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0022/1170/221170v2-max-150x150.png"],[[220,183],"assets/images/resized/0022/1170/221170v2-max-250x250.png"],[[220,183],"assets/images/resized/0022/1170/221170v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York City","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
