These discounts are passed on to the customer, but because it’s important for a winery to protect its brand, they remove their label and add their own.</p>\n\n<p>At Rewinery, you can buy wine whenever you feel like it.We can deliver to your home or office or wherever you may be, and quickly—usually within the hour. If you ever receive a wine that you don’t like, we’ll send you a different one.
