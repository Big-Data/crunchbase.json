The price job seekers bid reflects their true proficiency for those skills. This eliminates rÃ©sumÃ© spam by filtering out unqualified candidates. VR thus enables specifically targeted search for talent and opportunity just like AdWords does for products and services.</p>\n\n<p>Venturocket uses a novel pay-per-connection system: both the &#8220;connector&#8221; and the &#8220;connectee&#8221; &#8211; e.g., employer and job seeker &#8211; pay the same fee based on the job seeker&#8217;s bids for the matching skills when a connection is made. This helps ensure that (1) the job seeker is actually qualified and (2) the employer is serious to set up an interview.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/2632/142632v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/2632/142632v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[353,353],"assets/images/resized/0014/2632/142632v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CWO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Gould","permalink":"derek-gould","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Hoag","permalink":"marc-hoag","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Engineer & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Linn","permalink":"joseph-linn","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Pillsbury Winthrop","permalink":"pillsbury-winthrop","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0014/2630/142630v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0014/2630/142630v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0014/2630/142630v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0014/2631/142631v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,206],"assets/images/resized/0014/2631/142631v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,370],"assets/images/resized/0014/2631/142631v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
