By tracking buyer behavior before, during and after an event and then filtering the overload of data into actionable information, we create revenue streams for our event producer clients, from the more than 10MM attendees and 2MM vendors; all of whom can use, BusyEvent.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0017/2248/172248v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0017/2248/172248v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[410,317],"assets/images/resized/0017/2248/172248v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"gomobile.pro","permalink":"gomobile-pro","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"J.
