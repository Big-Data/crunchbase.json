Privia&#8217;s membership programs significantly enhance the doctor-patient relationship - combining the latest web and social networking technologies, real-time remote monitoring of a patient&#8217;s key health data, daily progress tracking on custom individual wellness plans, and a patient relationship management system that proactively identities care gaps, and alerts patients and their doctor when attention is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Privia offers its members a more personal and convenient healthcare experience delivered through its national high performance network of top doctors.
