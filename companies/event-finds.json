It allows vendors to tap into new markets as well.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every vendor has un-booked dates, but there was no place to promote them specifically and to a large targeted audience. Only quality, experienced vendors are listed after they fill out an application and are approved. On eventfinds.com each vendor lists their un-booked dates or special promotions at a pre-negotiated price. Members sign up to view their exclusive deals for free and contact them directly to ask questions and book the deal. Event finds members are &#8220;savvy savers,&#8221; people who like the finer things in life, but also love a great deal!</p>\n\n<p>The site benefits both vendors and people planning an event, keeping the process of booking as easy as possible and creating lifetime relationships!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0020/0274/200274v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0020/0274/200274v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,124],"assets/images/resized/0020/0274/200274v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President/Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Lou","last_name":"Lomibao","permalink":"lou-lomibao","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Karla","last_name":"Amador","permalink":"karla-amador","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"92656","city":"Aliso Viejo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[142,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/0273/200273v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/0273/200273v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[428,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/0273/200273v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
