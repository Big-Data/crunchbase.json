The potential insight in this information could determine the fate of businesses, economies, our health, and even our safety.\nBut Big Data is useless unless organizations can find a reliable, cost-effective way to apply predictive analytics to it. </p>\n\n<p>And because most data modeling solutions are prohibitively expensive to buy and maintain, nuggets of insight â€“ the stuff of breakthroughs â€“ lie hidden among massive datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Alpine Data Labs came onto the scene with Big Data in its DNA. Incubated within Greenplum (acquired by EMC in 2010), Alpine Data Labs shares many of Greenplum&#8217;s values. </p>\n\n<p>Just as Greenplum sought to develop the world&#8217;s fastest and most scalable database system, Alpine Data Labs immediately set out to make data modeling and scoring a faster and more scalable process.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4167/134167v1-max-150x150.png"],[[151,207],"assets/images/resized/0013/4167/134167v1-max-250x250.png"],[[151,207],"assets/images/resized/0013/4167/134167v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Anderson","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"anderson-wong-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Yi-Ling","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"yi-ling-chen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, North American Sales","person":{"first_name":"ROBERT","last_name":"CARLSON","permalink":"robert-carlson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Public Relations","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Oro Group","permalink":"david-oro","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0015/9793/159793v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0015/9793/159793v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0015/9793/159793v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$7.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techcrunchit.com/2011/05/11/alpine-data-labs-scores-7-5-million-to-help-companies-analyze-troves-of-data/","source_description":"Alpine Data Labs Scores $7.5 Million To Help Companies Analyze Troves Of Data","raised_amount":7500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":11,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sierra Ventures","permalink":"sierra-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/2271/72271v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/2271/72271v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[325,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/2271/72271v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mission Ventures","permalink":"mission-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/9391/29391v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/9391/29391v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[296,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/9391/29391v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sumitomo Corporation Equity Asia","permalink":"sumitomo-corporation-equity-asia","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Stanford University","permalink":"stanford-university","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/0949/30949v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0003/0949/30949v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[255,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/0949/30949v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1900 South Norfolk Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"94403 ","city":"San Mateo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0014/5778/145778v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0014/5778/145778v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,309],"assets/images/resized/0014/5778/145778v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
