Anthillz profiles are focused on peer recommendations rather than on a professionalâ€™s resume, helping to provide deeper insight into a professionalâ€™s image in their community.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/2924/22924v2-max-150x150.png"],[[160,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/2924/22924v2-max-250x250.png"],[[160,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/2924/22924v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"LinkedIn","permalink":"linkedin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/1055/11055v23-max-150x150.png"],[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/1055/11055v23-max-250x250.png"],[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/1055/11055v23-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Plaxo","permalink":"plaxo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0000/3880/3880v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/3880/3880v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,141],"assets/images/resized/0000/3880/3880v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/04/dreamit-incubator-holds-funding-day-to-commemorate-first-graduating-class/","source_description":"DreamIt Incubator Holds Funding Day To Commemorate First Graduating Class","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"DreamIt Ventures","permalink":"dreamit-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"3701 Market Street  Suite 417","address2":"","zip_code":"19104","city":"Philadelphia","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.95644,"longitude":-75.196171}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/User-Gen-Content/anthrillz-com-freelancer-reviews","title":"Anthillz.com - Freelancer Reviews"},{"external_url":"http://www.centernetworks.com/anthillz-ratings-trusted-reviews","title":"Anthillz Helps You Build an Online Work Reputation"}]}
