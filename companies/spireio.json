This new type of development platform off-loads the complex and expensive server-side engineering to Spire.io&#8217;s hosted service. This frees developers to focus on optimizing features rather than infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>With Spire.io, any developer can easily add secure, scalable, and optimized back-end functionality to any application in minutes. Spire.io helps developers save weeks of engineering time, reducing initial build costs and time-to-market. Once launched, applications benefit from an elastic architecture, reducing the risk of down-time and performance issues.</p>\n\n<p>Developers can count on Spire.io as a premium one-stop destination for server-side solutions thanks to their unified APIs, which ensure easy integration and low technical risk.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/3237/83237v4-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0008/3237/83237v4-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0008/3237/83237v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Diego","last_name":"Prats","permalink":"diego-prats","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Yoder","permalink":"dan-yoder","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Orrick, Harrington & Sutcliffe, LLP","permalink":"orrick-harrington-sutcliffe-llp","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0017/2740/172740v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,120],"assets/images/resized/0017/2740/172740v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,216],"assets/images/resized/0017/2740/172740v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0018/7516/187516v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0018/7516/187516v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0018/7516/187516v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0018/8753/188753v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0018/8753/188753v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,265],"assets/images/resized/0018/8753/188753v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://betakit.com/2012/04/28/startups-in-the-business-of-apis","title":"Startups in the Business of APIs"}]}
