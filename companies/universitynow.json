Its mission is to help ensure that affordable, high quality post-secondary education is available to people everywhere.  To accomplish this, UniversityNow is building a network of the most affordable and accessible accredited universities in the world, starting with the launch of New Charter University (http://new.edu).</p>\n\n<p>UniversityNow&#8217;s vision is a world in which no one is deprived of access to quality education â€” a world in which students can obtain recognized college degrees that improve their futures, without taking on the burden of student debt.</p>\n\n<p>This includes employing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Technology-assisted learning environments focused on efficiency and student success;</p></li>\n<li><p>Peer-to-peer learning communities where students share their knowledge and skills, and help each other obtain recognized degrees and credentials;</p></li>\n<li><p>Pedagogical models where the faculty serves as mentors and coaches as well as subject matter experts;</p></li>\n<li><p>Evaluation systems that measure student achievement on whether students meet standards that are rigorous, clearly articulated and recognized; and</p></li>\n<li><p>Tuition models that are significantly more affordable.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0019/4970/194970v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0019/4970/194970v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,77],"assets/images/resized/0019/4970/194970v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
