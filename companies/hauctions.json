She explains: â€œWe are dragging the age old tradition of selling horses at auction into the modern age by using the internet to match the right horse to the right buyer at the right price, whether 50 or 5000 miles away. Every sale is transparent and completely secure, and every buyer and seller profiled. I have already sold many horses by video alone, to the Middle East, America and across the UK, and frequently hold telephone auctions to determine a horseâ€™s true value. It is high time we brought the worldâ€™s entire equine community into one global auction place for the benefit of all.â€</p>\n\n<p>Investors have spent over Â£200,000 on a 12 month development programme, undertaken by teams in New York, Bucharest and London with expertise in multi national financial trading systems. Horses can be purchased in any currency with complete security. On completion of sale, funds are transferred to an escrow account and automatically released on either veterinary approval, delivery or shipping confirmation according to vendor instruction. Horse owners can list horses for a 3% fee deducted only on successful sale. Traditional media and breed society members will be invited to list horses online for a discounted rate.</p>\n\n<p>The platform goes live on 15 April at www.hauctions.net . Those who pre-register from Friday 17 February may win a horse and will be entitled to sell at 2%.</p>\n\n<p>Further Information and interview opportunities:</p>\n\n<p>Please call Matthew Rymer on 01242 222878 / email mr@themarketingfarm.co.uk.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0012/3901/123901v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0012/3901/123901v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[333,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/3901/123901v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
