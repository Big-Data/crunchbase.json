Users can upload, print, and share photos with friends. Printing photos is Snapfish&#8217;s main focus for the site. This is a different focus than most photo sharing and storage sites that usually have a strong focus on the community aspect, like Flickr.</p>\n\n<p>Snapfish has even partnered with retail stores like Costco and Walgreens so you can pick up your prints locally. Users can also easily create gifts, photo books and cards using their photos.</p>\n\n<p>Users are encouraged to upload as many photos as they want since they have unlimited uploads. However, to keep unlimited upload status users are required to buy prints at least once every year or their photos will be deleted. This is easy to get around since you can buy a single print for around $0.12.</p>\n\n<p>Main competitors include <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr\" title=\"Flickr\">Flickr</a>, <a
