It winds up costing a couple of dollars to use Attikis to monitor your Alarm System for a whole year. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0010/9961/109961v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0010/9961/109961v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,146],"assets/images/resized/0010/9961/109961v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JkdBrqQlRhw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[93,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/3429/163429v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[156,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/3429/163429v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[281,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/3429/163429v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
