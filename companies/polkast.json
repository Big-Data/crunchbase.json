Instead of sending your content up to the cloud, Polkast brings the cloud to you. Polkast creates your own personal cloud dynamically, letting your mobile devices directly access your home base computers. Polkast automatically detects your proximity to the PC and choose the fastest route: Wi-Fi or over the internet. Polkast then opens a secure connection and encrypts all transmissions. So you can securely access all of your content directly.</p>\n\n<p>By maximizing Wi-Fi bandwidth, Polkast allows users to retrieve any of their data files up to 10x faster than the traditional cloud. This peer-to-peer approach also means privacy and security are 100% under your control. And removing cloud storage limitations means access to 100% of your files. Using Polkast is as easy as downloading the free app and logging in. Get access to 500 GB of content instead of 2-5 GB. Fetch a video file from across the room takes a few minutes not hours. Share without file size limits.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7345/147345v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/7345/147345v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/7345/147345v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"370\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/U-znhyxcw2I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0014/7346/147346v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,201],"assets/images/resized/0014/7346/147346v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,363],"assets/images/resized/0014/7346/147346v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[76,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7347/147347v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/7347/147347v2-max-250x250.png"],[[167,326],"assets/images/resized/0014/7347/147347v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
