Gemsta is the combination of a search engine, a research tool, and a social networking site. Guaranteed to make anyoneâ€™s web life simpler, Gemsta takes the effort out of surfing the web.  </p>\n\n<p>Itâ€™s simple to sign up, either creating a Gemsta account, or signing in using credentials from any of the following sites: </p>\n\n<p>&gt; Google &gt; Facebook &gt; Yahoo &gt; Blogger &gt; Wordpress &gt; Flickr  </p>\n\n<p>The mission for Gemsta is simple. To make a users web experience that little bit easier.  </p>\n\n<p>Using Find It a user can quickly search from single or multiple providers. Categorised in to easy sections, split between research and shopping, its intuitive design serves as a reminder to the vast resources available online. Through a simple drag and drop interface you can even create a customised zone. Having chucked in a comparison and vouchers site for good measure, not to mention an award winning interactive 3D world, featured in a â€˜Future of the Internetâ€™ article by the Times Online, there really is something for everyone.   </p>\n\n<p>Using a simple browser link called a bookmarklet, Gemsta users can save any websites, videos, or shopping to their accounts without any specialist software installed. Automatically suggesting tags, and saving relevant page info, even allows the user to search through these saves quickly. Not satisfied with only these media types, Gemsta have also set about creating two toolbars for Internet Explorer and Firefox, with image cropping and text copy features, as well as a quick search. </p>\n\n<p>Within a shared folder, Gemsta updates your friends, and everyone can view all the saves in one place. Stick your comments underneath, and strike up a conversation. Want to post it up on your Facebook, just click the logo.</p>\n\n<p>To get started with your favourites, from your browser or delicious, simply use the importer tool, and get it on to Gemsta. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[87,129],"assets/images/resized/0011/7192/117192v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[87,129],"assets/images/resized/0011/7192/117192v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[87,129],"assets/images/resized/0011/7192/117192v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"5 The Triangle","address2":"Wildwood Drive","zip_code":"WR5 2QX","city":"Worcester","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
