Chat and collaborate with multiple people at once through the easiest group messaging available.  NO text costs.</p></li>\n<li><p>FRIENDS MAP - See your 20 on a map with real-time location sharing.  Toggle location sharing on/off anytime with one easy press (RED light means OFF, GREEN light means ON)!</p></li>\n<li><p>PRIVATE COMMENTS on Facebook STREAM - View your Facebook activity in the streams tab.  Except on 20@ it&#8217;s even better!

So easy to use, everyone already knows how to use it!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Forget the noise &amp; clutter of the old social networks, and interact more with the people that really matter.  20@ lets you communicate freely without concerns about over-sharing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/8926/158926v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0015/8926/158926v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,181],"assets/images/resized/0015/8926/158926v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Home Office","address1":"122 W 26th st","address2":"Floor 4","zip_code":"10012","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
