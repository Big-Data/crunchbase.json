You can request anything you want, including experiences! All you have to do is choose a picture to represent the item you want using our image library or by uploading your own picture.</p>\n\n<p>After you choose the picture, you tell us how much you need to raise to get the item. All Things Wishful divides the image into a grid of clickable tiles based on the price you set.</p>\n\n<p>Tell your friends about your registry by sending them your unique All Things Wishful URL, and you&#8217;re ready to start receiving.</p>\n\n<p>Your friends choose an item from your registry and use our clickable tiles to let us know which portions of the items they would like to buy you.</p>\n\n<p>We collect the funds from your friends and deposit them into your Amazon Payments account; you watch your balance grow.</p>\n\n<p>With your funds, you can get what you want, when you want and from where you want. You don&#8217;t have to worry about shipping and handling charges, getting rid of packaging and returning gifts that you don&#8217;t want. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"MINA","last_name":"YOO","permalink":"mina-yoo","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"ARRY","last_name":"SHIN","permalink":"arry-shin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"MICHAEL","last_name":"REILLY","permalink":"michael-reilly-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Fenwick & West","permalink":"fenwick-west","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/6899/16899v1-max-150x150.png"],[[196,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6899/16899v1-max-250x250.png"],[[196,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6899/16899v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Mailing Address","address1":"1122 East Pike Street #978","address2":"","zip_code":"98122","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
