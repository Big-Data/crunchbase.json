Without the hardware.</p>\n\n<p>With Zapstreak’s technology embedded within a media app, Android app devs can enable user’s to push music streams, videos or images to a connected TV, adding a completely new dimension to the viewing experience at home.</p>\n\n<p>For developers, Zapstreak represents an opportunity to integrate a new and engaging way to share and view content, whilst making their app more appealing and ‘stickier’. By using Zapstreak’s SDK, developers negate the need for costly native app development, estimated at around €50K.</p>\n\n<p>Using DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance), the technology standard that allows the sharing of digital content between connected devices, media from an Android app can be listened to or viewed on a connected TV, as long as both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network. The vast majority of connected TVs being sold today include the DLNA standard.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0020/3206/203206v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/3206/203206v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0020/3206/203206v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"Bielau","permalink":"stefan-bielau","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Rutkowski","permalink":"matt-rutkowski","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"ul.
