It’s not that easy though – you loose points when you close the task after it’s due or even by moving it forward in time.\nYou can compare yourself to others and, if you’re good, own your tag in your country or even the world for example: “become the Yoda of Design in Silicon Valley“.</p>\n\n<p>Although you’re not sharing your work or tasks, you can show your friends or headhunters how much you have done lately by publishing your trophies wall. Having in mind, that you wouldn’t want to show them how much deadlines you have missed – that’s the ultimate motivation for you.</p>\n\n<p>App itself has the most important time saving functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Create a task with delegation, start date, deadline, priority, tag, or recurring task using only your keyboard and shortcuts. You don&#8217;t have to click a million times to make it real.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use folders with your files. And most of all - upload them by dragging and dropping. You can also see how much space is left at one glance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add comments and attachments to your or others&#8217; tasks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Itemz has it&#8217;s built-in trophies which you can collect by finishing tasks, doing it before the deadline, reading the tutorial, inviting people, having many tasks in a specific tag and for the million other reasons. But if you&#8217;re the manager of your team - you can create additional trophies for sitting at work after 6 PM or winning the company&#8217;s Call of Duty tournament - it&#8217;s your call.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/4808/194808v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0019/4808/194808v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0019/4808/194808v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Designer","person":{"first_name":"Kate","last_name":"Mrozek","permalink":"kate-mrozek","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/5081/195081v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/5081/195081v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/5081/195081v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Mrozek","permalink":"tom-mrozek","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Wunderlist","permalink":"wunderlist","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Producteev","permalink":"producteev","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/4705/24705v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/4705/24705v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/4705/24705v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Nozbe","permalink":"nozbe","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/3180/23180v1-max-150x150.png"],[[226,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3180/23180v1-max-250x250.png"],[[226,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3180/23180v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"basecamp","permalink":"basecamp","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Lesna 23","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Swarzedz","state_code":null,"country_code":"POL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/4805/194805v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/4805/194805v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/4805/194805v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0019/4806/194806v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0019/4806/194806v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,304],"assets/images/resized/0019/4806/194806v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/4807/194807v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/4807/194807v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/4807/194807v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sociableblog.com/2012/04/28/turning-request-signups-into-game/","title":"Turning Request Sign-Ups into a Game (Case Study)"}]}
