Adaptive Streaming is a process that adjusts the quality of a video delivered to the user based on changing network conditions to ensure the best possible viewer experience.</p>\n\n<p>Forga.com uses Adobe Flash Media Server 3.5 for streaming. Unlike HTTP streaming, Flash Media Server delivers video through RTMP protocol which is more secure, robust and even more interactive! Movies playing at Forga.com do not cache in the users browsers. RTMP streaming also enables the user to seek past the current playback point regardless of whether that particular part of the movie has been loaded or not. </p>\n\n<p>Forga uses Limelight Networks as their content distribution network. </p>\n\n<p>Available Qualities</p>\n\n<p>We encode media at 5 different qualities accommodating the most unstable internet connection ranging from 100 kbps to 700 kbps to ensure the most engaging viewing experience.</p>\n\n<p>Downloads Support</p>\n\n<p>If the user would prefer to view the movie offline, we provide them with the ability to download movies that are digitally protected using Windows Media Â® and available for offline playback.</p>\n\n<p>Features Of Forga:\nOur user experience at Forga.com is user-oriented and is tailored to be straight to the point without additional unneeded steps. We challenge ourselves to minimize the steps required for the user to achieve a desired goal on the website.
