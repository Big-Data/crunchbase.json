The platform enables advertisers and agencies to connect with ad networks and publishers in a simplified and more transparent manner.</p>\n\n<p>For advertisers and agencies managing a digital marketing campaign can be a difficult and time-consuming process.  With media planning and media buying a large portion of marketing budgets are spent before an ad is served.  Advertisers and agencies are then spending significant time consolidating and making sense of multiple reports from different channels, networks and publishers.  Ad Avengers makes this process simple.</p>\n\n<p>Publishers and networks benefit from having better and more advertisers on their sites.  Publishers and networks are ultra competitive and donâ€™t have a simple platform to attract and manage campaigns for advertisers.  Ad Avengers will enable networks and publishers to distribute their inventory in a consistent manner.</p>\n\n<p>Ad Avengers removes a great deal of the physical, manual process behind digital advertising and makes digital advertising simpler for advertisers, agencies, networks and publishers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0009/3802/93802v5-max-150x150.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0009/3802/93802v5-max-250x250.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0009/3802/93802v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Farhan","last_name":"Lalji","permalink":"farhan-lalji","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0009/3022/93022v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0009/3022/93022v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0009/3022/93022v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>James Broad / [Kulor} (http://www.flickr.com/photos/kulor/)</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London Headquarters","address1":"2ND Floor","address2":"145-157 St John Street","zip_code":"EC1V 4PY","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/28832295?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/28832295\">AdAvenger Video Draft</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/decipherlabs\">Decipher Labs</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Ad Avengers video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6864/156864v2-max-150x150.png"],[[244,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/6864/156864v2-max-250x250.png"],[[440,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/6864/156864v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6865/156865v2-max-150x150.png"],[[244,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/6865/156865v2-max-250x250.png"],[[440,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/6865/156865v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0015/6866/156866v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,175],"assets/images/resized/0015/6866/156866v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,315],"assets/images/resized/0015/6866/156866v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0015/6867/156867v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0015/6867/156867v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,448],"assets/images/resized/0015/6867/156867v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2011/01/22/seedcamp-reveals-the-18-companies-selected-for-london/","title":"Seedcamp reveals the 18 companies selected for London"}]}
