FlickLaunch allows a filmmaker to market and distribute a film directly to their audience and receive up to 70% of the revenue on Facebook. FlickLaunch will offer its secure platform for major studio distributions and Indie movie producers. Taking advantage of the social graph, FlickLaunch enables virality by allowing distribution through FB plugins such as LIKE, POST, RECOMMEND and INVITE. While the audience has an opportunity to watch a newly released movie on the producer&#8217;s fan page, the producer also has an opportunity to ride the outstanding reach of Facebook globally.</p>\n\n<p>FlickLaunch is releasing FlickMobile on iPad and iPhone in the coming months. FlickMobile seamlessly integrates streaming movie viewing on the pad with Facebook wall sharing and asynchronous chats with friends. The mobile application will also allow Indies to penetrate a 14 million+ tablet market rapidly.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0013/3756/133756v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0013/3756/133756v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,131],"assets/images/resized/0013/3756/133756v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"FlickLaunch, FlickMobile, FlickReview, FlickGenome","permalink":"flicklaunch-flickmobile-flickreview-flickgenome","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Moore","permalink":"erik-moore","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Tanner","permalink":"craig-tanner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Merket","permalink":"ryan-merket","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0002/4113/24113v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0002/4113/24113v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[422,280],"assets/images/resized/0002/4113/24113v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Steve Rassmussen / <a href=\"http://www.razpix.com\" title=\"RazPix\" rel=\"nofollow\">RazPix</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technology Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Pinaki","last_name":"Saha","permalink":"pinaki-saha","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarter","address1":"3030 Ashby Ave., Suite #200","address2":"","zip_code":"94705","city":"Berkeley","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0013/3758/133758v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0013/3758/133758v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,272],"assets/images/resized/0013/3758/133758v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://flicklaunch.com","title":"FlickLaunch"},{"external_url":"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/startup-flicklaunch-debuts-movie-distribution-187233","title":"Hollywood Reporter covers FlickLaunch"},{"external_url":"http://www.homemediamagazine.com/vod/flicklaunch-bows-indie-vod-service-facebook-23914","title":"Home Media covers FlickLaunch"}]}
