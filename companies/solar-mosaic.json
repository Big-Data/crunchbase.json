They want everyone to be able to invest directly into local clean energy projects.</p>\n\n<p>Hundreds of people from across the United States have invested thousands of dollars to finance solar projects through Mosaic&#8217;s online marketplace. All of the projects are carefully vetted to maximize impact in the form of clean energy and green jobs while minimizing risk to the investors. The beneficiaries of these solar projects have ranged from People’s Grocery, a food justice non-profit in Oakland, CA to The Murdoch Center, a vibrant community center in Flagstaff, AZ.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, Mosaic received a $2M grant from the U.S. Department of Energy and raised $3.4M from venture capital investors to bring Mosaic&#8217;s crowdfunding platform to scale.
