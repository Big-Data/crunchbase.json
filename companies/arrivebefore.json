With only an average number of social media users, the Founder and CEO could always find one friend or a couple in NYC at the same time. This despite being 20 hours by flight from home but the problem was visits were short, time at a premium and friends only identified from a status update or posting of pictures. Often this was too late to do anything about.</p>\n\n<p>After realising a gap existed in publishing your upcoming Check-in, ArriveBefore came to life through a Patent Pending method to enable experiences to be enhanced by those in your social networks.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0021/8058/218058v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0021/8058/218058v2-max-250x250.png"],[[310,100],"assets/images/resized/0021/8058/218058v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"King","permalink":"alan-king","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0022/0307/220307v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0022/0307/220307v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0022/0307/220307v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"Angel Investment","raised_amount":10000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Ozbox","permalink":"ozbox","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office - Postal","address1":"PO Box 1192","address2":"Victoria","zip_code":"3188","city":"Hampton North","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Go Live!
