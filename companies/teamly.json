Appropriately timed emails ask you to review how well you did and ask you to set priorities in advance of the next time period. Managers get a dashboard so they can see at a glance what their direct reports are working on, and can view statistics on the percentage of priorities completed. These are useful not only for day-to-day management but also for traditional periodic HR performance reviews as they provide solid evidence of performance (or lack of).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0009/2529/92529v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0009/2529/92529v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,123],"assets/images/resized/0009/2529/92529v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Allison","permalink":"scott-allison","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0009/2493/92493v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,228],"assets/images/resized/0009/2493/92493v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[297,272],"assets/images/resized/0009/2493/92493v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Robertshaw","permalink":"edward-robertshaw-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Berman","permalink":"matt-berman","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Thibaut","last_name":"Courouble","permalink":"thibaut-courouble","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/4167/94167v6-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/4167/94167v6-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/4167/94167v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Renzo","last_name":"Borgatti","permalink":"renzo-borgatti","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"SuccessFactors","permalink":"successfactors","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0000/3151/3151v5-max-150x150.png"],[[217,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/3151/3151v5-max-250x250.png"],[[217,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/3151/3151v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Rypple","permalink":"rypple","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/9056/89056v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/9056/89056v5-max-250x250.png"],[[324,85],"assets/images/resized/0008/9056/89056v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"WorkSimple","permalink":"worksimple","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/6608/66608v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/6608/66608v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,96],"assets/images/resized/0006/6608/66608v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sonar6","permalink":"sonar6","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/7996/27996v2-max-150x150.png"],[[179,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/7996/27996v2-max-250x250.png"],[[179,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/7996/27996v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Dorsey & Whitney","permalink":"dorsey-whitney","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"c/o TechHub","address2":"76-80 City Rd","zip_code":"EC1Y 2BJ","city":"LONDON","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/14297800\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/14297800\">Introduction to Teamly</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/teamly\">Teamly</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Introduction to Teamly</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/9905/129905v2-max-150x150.png"],[[247,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/9905/129905v2-max-250x250.png"],[[445,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/9905/129905v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/9906/129906v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0012/9906/129906v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0012/9906/129906v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://lifehacker.com/5655982/teamly-is-a-priority+based-project-management-tool","title":"Lifehacker review"},{"external_url":"http://webworkerdaily.com/2010/08/09/teamly-collaboration-with-priorities/","title":"GigaOm review"},{"external_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/teamly-sets-out-to-create-realtime-staff-performance-streams-for-business/","title":"Teamly at TechCrunch Disrupt"}]}
