It offers data from Twitter, Youtube, Bing, Flickr and more. </p>\n\n<p>Topics.io provides API’s services. It enables users to define their topics, and then retrieve relevant contents about them.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, search engines use “keywords” to find relevant contents. Topics.io uses a “topic centric” approach. It’s based on “keywords” too, but add context information to increase the response quality. </p>\n\n<p>Several applications, on the web, use this API: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>http://skeedy.com, a news aggregator where users can define their own topics.</li>\n<li>http://diablo-news.com, a blog web site focused on Diablo 3 video game.</li>\n<li>Some Twitter accounts are automatically populated with news. By example, @timburton<em>news and @almodovar</em>news</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This company is based in Montreal, QC, Canada, and was founded in 2011.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0017/0450/170450v2-max-150x150.png"],[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0017/0450/170450v2-max-250x250.png"],[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0017/0450/170450v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"founder","person":{"first_name":"Didier","last_name":"Rano","permalink":"didier-rano","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"founder","person":{"first_name":"Wesley","last_name":"Bouarab","permalink":"wesley-bouarab","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Gnip","permalink":"gnip","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/5747/15747v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0001/5747/15747v1-max-250x250.png"],[[306,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/5747/15747v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"DataSift","permalink":"datasift","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0010/2730/102730v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0010/2730/102730v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,113],"assets/images/resized/0010/2730/102730v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0017/0803/170803v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,229],"assets/images/resized/0017/0803/170803v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,412],"assets/images/resized/0017/0803/170803v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
