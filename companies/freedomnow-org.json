According to the United States government, an estimated 14,500-17,500 people are trafficked into the US every year. Many worldwide government concerns and NGOs have been working hard to stop human trafficking. FreedomNow.org has recently joined this community in order to fight against this global curse in a unique way.</p>\n\n<p>What is FreedomNow.org?</p>\n\n<p>FreedomNow.org is a non-profit venture started by Ethics 360, a group of companies providing services related to anti-bribery education, training and publishing for multi-nationals and their third party intermediaries.</p>\n\n<p>The principal goal of this project is to collect detailed information on known traffickers and make this available to governments, banks, anti-money laundering (AML) data providers as well as general audiences around the world.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, FreedomNow.org features a host of resources for trafficking victims and their advocates, including NGO directories categorized by country and a job board where NGOs can advertise vacant positions.</p>\n\n<p>How will FreedomNow.org work?</p>\n\n<p>FreedomNow.com is a web project based on “Wiki” technology, which gives power to any individual who has relevant information regarding human trafficking to contribute for the sake of humanity. However, due to the sensitive nature of the topic, FreedomNow.org does not give full access to publish anything immediately. FreedomNow has a team of editors who review every submission made by members and promptly publish those that are relevant and accurate.</p>\n\n<p>More than 13,000 trafficker and agent records are already available. FreedomNow editors and community members update site records on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>Join FreedomNow.org</p>\n\n<p>Take the fight against modern-day slavery to the traffickers.
