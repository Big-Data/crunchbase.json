The solution automatically identifies abnormal behaviors and signs of decline by detecting wear/non-wear patterns, activity level, and whether the user is indoors or outdoors for extended periods.  Caregivers can receive real-time alerts via smartphone, tablet, email, or text message.   </p>\n\n<p>The solution is waterproof and power optimized to last over a year without the need for recharge.  This enables the senior to wear the device and stay connected to their caregivers 24 hours/day.  QMedic provides 24-hour access to emergency call center services.  </p>\n\n<p>QMedic is a 2011 recipient of an SBIR Contract from the National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health, and a 2012 finalist for the AARP Startup Award.   The company has specialized expertise in signal processing, objective behavioral measurement, and sensor development.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0021/5451/215451v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0021/5451/215451v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,88],"assets/images/resized/0021/5451/215451v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Fahd","last_name":"Albinali","permalink":"fahd-albinali","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0013/9833/139833v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0013/9833/139833v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0013/9833/139833v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sombit","last_name":"Mishra","permalink":"sombit-mishra","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,100],"assets/images/resized/0013/6017/136017v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,100],"assets/images/resized/0013/6017/136017v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,100],"assets/images/resized/0013/6017/136017v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>EveryFit</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Nelson","permalink":"david-nelson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"33 Richdale Avenue, Suite 109","address2":"","zip_code":"02140","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0021/1966/211966v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0021/1966/211966v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[450,347],"assets/images/resized/0021/1966/211966v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0021/1967/211967v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,237],"assets/images/resized/0021/1967/211967v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,427],"assets/images/resized/0021/1967/211967v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0021/5450/215450v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0021/5450/215450v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,122],"assets/images/resized/0021/5450/215450v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://health50.org/finalists/","title":"AARP Startup Award Finalist"}]}
