Each individual team member has a personal page page where they can see their assignments and enter their time. The timesheet module is pre-populated with the scoped time for each assignment so users can just &#8216;confirm&#8217; time rather than enter it and know ahead of time what they are assigned to. Each project has a dedicated page that provides status and projected time based on real-time information. </p>\n\n<p>All the data generated is cascaded through out the system and can be accessed through an analytics module that requires no calculations. Users can generate complex company or individual reports with a few clicks.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, 10,000ft build a searchable knowledge base of projects so users can use past data to improve project planning.</p>\n\n<p>10,000ft is designed to bubble up critical information, rather than detailed tasks like most project management solutions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,130],"assets/images/resized/0022/0456/220456v2-max-150x150.png"],[[160,139],"assets/images/resized/0022/0456/220456v2-max-250x250.png"],[[160,139],"assets/images/resized/0022/0456/220456v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Girling","permalink":"rob-girling","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Martijn","last_name":"van Tilburg","permalink":"martijn-von-tilburg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/9677/199677v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[202,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/9677/199677v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,271],"assets/images/resized/0019/9677/199677v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer","person":{"first_name":"Shyam","last_name":"Habarakada","permalink":"shyam-habarakada","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Gavin","last_name":"Kelly","permalink":"gavin-kelly","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"Gil Miner","permalink":"adriana-gil-miner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Ort","permalink":"jeff-ort","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Customer Relations","person":{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"Prins","permalink":"anne-prins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Strategy","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Gelfuso","permalink":"jeff-gelfuso","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"LiquidPlanner","permalink":"liquidplanner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Harvest","permalink":"harvest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/3585/43585v2-max-150x150.png"],[[244,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/3585/43585v2-max-250x250.png"],[[244,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/3585/43585v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"225 Terry Avenue N","address2":"","zip_code":"98109","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0022/0090/220090v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0022/0090/220090v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0022/0090/220090v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0022/0091/220091v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0022/0091/220091v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0022/0091/220091v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0022/0092/220092v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0022/0092/220092v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0022/0092/220092v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670069/a-project-management-tool-built-for-some-of-the-countrys-best-design-firms","title":"A Project Management Tool Built For Some Of The Countryâ€™s Best Design Firms"},{"external_url":"http://www.geekwire.com/2012/artefact-spinoff-launches-first-product-10000ft-software-for-managing-projects-people/","title":"Artefact spinoff launches first product: 10,000ft helps manage projects, people"},{"external_url":"http://web.appstorm.net/reviews/project-management/project-management-for-the-creative-worker-10000ft/","title":"10,000ft: Project Management for the Creative Worker"}]}
