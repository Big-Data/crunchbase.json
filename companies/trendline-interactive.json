They conduct ongoing research on marketing trends and consumer behavior that provide the basis for their unbiased strategic advice to companies on how to grow their brands through better engagement with subscribers. </p>\n\n<p>What Trendline Interactive does: \nThey challenge companies to rethink what is relevant to their customers and prospects and how best to foster these relationships. Then, they help companies make relevance a reality.</p>\n\n<p>How Trendline Interactive is different:\nThere are groups that do research without practical experience, and others that do strategy without the benefit of research. Trendline Interactive combines both for a unique 360-degree approach to create pragmatic solutions that benefit companies by sparking customer engagement and improving the brandâ€™s bottom line. </p>\n\n<p>Why it matters:\nWinning the hearts and minds of customers is essential to making brands grow.  However, the convergence of media is changing the relationship between customers and brands.  To grow their customer relationships, companies need research-driven strategies and they need people who have been on the client side to help drive change.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0010/9217/109217v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/9217/109217v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,132],"assets/images/resized/0010/9217/109217v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Morgan","last_name":"Stewart","permalink":"morgan-stewart-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Chief Strategist","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Kordek","permalink":"andrew-kordek-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Strategic Services","person":{"first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Souder","permalink":"michele-souder-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sr. Digital Strategist","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Williams","permalink":"alex-williams-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/352/morgan-stewart","title":"Articles by Morgan Stewart published on MarketingProfs"},{"external_url":"http://www.imediaconnection.com/profiles/iMedia_PC_Articles.aspx?ID=10434","title":"Articles by Morgan Stewart published on iMedia Connection"},{"external_url":"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Archives.showArchive&author=1777","title":"Articles by Morgan Stewart published on MediaPost"}]}
