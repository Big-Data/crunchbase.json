The choice of two means of payment being a key aspect of the website, they decided to name it â€œSalt or Pepaâ€. In other words, they decided to make a pun: Â« Salt or Pepper / Salt or PayPal Â». - It is inspired by the LETS (Local Exchange Trading System).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When you accept Paypal, the billing is done by the minute and the advisor is free to set his own rate (between 0,1$ and 4$/minute)</li>\n<li>When you accept grains of salt as a currency, the advisor is also free to set his own rate (1, 2 or 3 grains per minute).  NB:  the only possibility to get grains of salt is to give an advice on the platform. They cannot be sold or bought.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A powerful webconferencing solution </p>\n\n<p>The web conferencing window opens with a single click (no installation needed). Advisors can share presentations (PDF, Word and PowerPoint documents) and both advisor and caller can make annotations (text, draw, geometrical shape), web page co-browsing, share whiteboard and screen, and last but not least record and playback meetings.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BitWine","permalink":"bitwineinc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/1603/1603v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1603/1603v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1603/1603v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wengo","permalink":"wengo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0006/4879/64879v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,38],"assets/images/resized/0006/4879/64879v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[359,55],"assets/images/resized/0006/4879/64879v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Skype","permalink":"skype","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,110],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-250x250.jpg"],[[315,139],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[144,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5252/125252v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5252/125252v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[433,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/5252/125252v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
