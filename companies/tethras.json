It allows even easier to maintain these localizations in future versions. </p>\n\n<p>Simply upload your resource files from your Xcode project via ZIP file upload or via SVN integration. Tethras will process your files, generate pseudo-translations for testing and provide instant quotes in over 40 languages. Following a purchase request, content proved is then sent out to a highly skilled network of human translators. </p>\n\n<p>The translators use a Tethras client app called TILT (Tethras Interactive Localization Tool) which allows for the adjustment of buttons and text objects that invariably need resizing after translation. TILT runs on Mac, Windows or Linux. It&#8217;s pretty cool</p>\n\n<p>Days, weeks or months after the app has been released in multiple languages, and a developer has just fixed a bug, or added a new feature, simply upload the latest English resource files to Tethras. The system can detect any changes made since the last delivery of localized content. Instant price quotes for existing languages, as well as any new languages added into the mix are generated. </p>\n\n<p>Tethras is all about supporting the continuous development process. Being developers too, the company has a strong understanding of the frequency at which apps are developed, released and updated as well as the time consuming nature of the localization  process. The aim of the service provided is to allow customers to do what they do best - build apps. Tethras will take care of the rest.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0013/1666/131666v2-max-150x150.png"],[[175,48],"assets/images/resized/0013/1666/131666v2-max-250x250.png"],[[175,48],"assets/images/resized/0013/1666/131666v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"farrell","permalink":"brian-farrell-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Brendan","last_name":"Clavin","permalink":"brendan-clavin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[81,81],"assets/images/resized/0013/1353/131353v2-max-150x150.png"],[[81,81],"assets/images/resized/0013/1353/131353v2-max-250x250.png"],[[81,81],"assets/images/resized/0013/1353/131353v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Farrell","permalink":"brian-farrell-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"US Office","address1":"800 W El Camino Real,","address2":"Suite 420","zip_code":"94040","city":"Mountainview","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Company Headquarters","address1":"NovaUCD,","address2":"Belfield Innovation Park","zip_code":"Dublin 4","city":"Belfield","state_code":null,"country_code":"IRL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"405\" height=\"233\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/X1W4xcPvCAY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Tethras | App Localization</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0015/4538/154538v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0015/4538/154538v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,311],"assets/images/resized/0015/4538/154538v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0015/4733/154733v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0015/4733/154733v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0015/4733/154733v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://tethras.com","title":"Tethras | App Localization"},{"external_url":"http://youtu.be/X1W4xcPvCAY","title":"Tethras | App Localization -  Youtube"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/tethras","title":"Tethras | App Localization - Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/tethras","title":"Tethras | App Localization - Facebook"}]}
