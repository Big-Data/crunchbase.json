Beside, it allows the manufacturers to communicate widely about their sustainability-aware KPIs. On a long term basis, a tendency towards the conception of more eco-friendly appliances will be revealed as well.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0009/6110/96110v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0009/6110/96110v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[280,148],"assets/images/resized/0009/6110/96110v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"HopBadge","permalink":"hopbadge","image":null},{"name":"HopScore.com","permalink":"hopscore-com","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"GoodGuide","permalink":"goodguide","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/4219/24219v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/4219/24219v3-max-250x250.png"],[[275,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/4219/24219v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Paris Office","address1":"28 rue du Chemin Vert","address2":"","zip_code":"75011","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13569831&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=c9ff23&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=0\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13569831&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=c9ff23&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>HopBadge on 3Suisses.fr</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0009/6111/96111v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0009/6111/96111v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,265],"assets/images/resized/0009/6111/96111v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0009/6112/96112v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0009/6112/96112v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0009/6112/96112v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0009/6113/96113v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0009/6113/96113v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0009/6113/96113v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.HopScore.com","title":"HopScore.com"}]}
