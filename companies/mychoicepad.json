We wanted to build something that was cool, easy to use and affordable for children and adults who struggle to communicate or those who are learning to communicate - the under 5&#8217;s. </p>\n\n<p>Being social is something we take for granted but for some people getting their message across is a little more difficult and it makes it hard to fit in, be independent and empowered. From cradle to grave, effective communication is essential for quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>So we built MyChoicePad. It&#8217;s an educational brand with an iPad app which uses Makaton symbols and sign graphics with signing videos and speech to enable children and adults with learning or communication difficulties to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>We built it in collaboration with The Makaton Charity who own the really excellent language programme with signs and symbols. You might have seen Makaton being used on CBeebies in the TV programme Something Special by Mr Tumble. A very popular character with the under 5&#8217;s.</p>\n\n<p>It is being used by families, schools and speech and language professionals across the UK and we&#8217;re keen to spread into Europe and Australia.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0013/8492/138492v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0013/8492/138492v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,136],"assets/images/resized/0013/8492/138492v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Juggler","person":{"first_name":"Zoe","last_name":"Peden","permalink":"zoe-peden","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0013/8484/138484v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,247],"assets/images/resized/0013/8484/138484v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,445],"assets/images/resized/0013/8484/138484v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Code Monkey","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jackman","permalink":"andrew-jackman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"http://youtu.be/g5Jnxq_lUgg","description":"<p>MyChoicePad promo video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/8491/138491v2-max-150x150.png"],[[192,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/8491/138491v2-max-250x250.png"],[[347,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/8491/138491v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
