ClosetRaid will be by invitation only initially to maintain a sense of community, trustworthiness and exclusivity. </p>\n\n<p>ClosetRaid will be unlike any other resale site out there because of the user interface, which will resemble a “Facebook” type layout instead of listing items like a marketplace. The layout allows users much more freedom to customize the site to their liking and really interact with other users versus the old model of posting listing after listing like other resale sites. By engaging visitors in their Closet through features like photos, Closet Graffiti (wall posts), messages and the “Want” feature, it gives depth to the visitor’s experience which will lead to longer browsing time on that person’s Closet, which in turn should lead to higher probability of a transaction. The site will also feature a “Free” option on items and gives users an opportunity to do good by donating items to local charities or just plainly give the item away for free to another user. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0018/0210/180210v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0018/0210/180210v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,158],"assets/images/resized/0018/0210/180210v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"371 State St Suite 8","address2":"","zip_code":"11217","city":"Brooklyn","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
