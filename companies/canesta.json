Such products can then react on sight to the actions or motions of individuals and objects in their field of view, gaining levels of functionality and ease of use that were simply not possible in an era when such devices were blind.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous applications are under active development by Canesta&#8217;s OEM customers and partners, including consumer electronics, PC, TV, building automation, security, robotics, automotive, and others. Such customers and partners include Hitachi, Honda, Optex, Optronic, Quanta, SMSC, and others which have yet to be announced.</p>\n\n<p>Canesta is located in Sunnyvale, CA. The company has filed in excess of fifty patents, 40 of which have been granted so far</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded in 1999 and is based in Sunnyvale,
