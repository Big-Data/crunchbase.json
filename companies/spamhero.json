After 13 years in the web hosting industry they&#8217;ve witnessed first hand the frustrations that business owners have over the cost of fighting spam, and the lackluster performance of existing solutions.</p>\n\n<p>What makes SpamHero different is that it is powered by a team of human spam-fighting technicians who are updating the filter rules several times a day.  Over 2 million rules have been compiled so far.   Unlike &#8220;robotic&#8221; algorithms that can sometimes mistake real email for spam, each rule is carefully crafted in such a way that  real email does not get blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Because SpamHero is a hosted solution, it requires no new hardware or software installed at a clientâ€™s location.   The client changes what is known as their domain&#8217;s MX record so that email flows through SpamHero&#8217;s filtering servers before it reaches the domain&#8217;s real mail server.  </p>\n\n<p>The filtering service all includes a Web 2.0 email quarantine that allows users to view the spam that is caught by the filter.</p>\n\n<p>Pricing for the service starts at $4.95 per month for domain-wide filtering, which the company founders believe is much less than similar solutions on the market.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/0077/60077v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0006/0077/60077v2-max-250x250.png"],[[390,130],"assets/images/resized/0006/0077/60077v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Curtis","last_name":"O'Reilly","permalink":"curtis-oreilly","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co- founder","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"O'Reilly","permalink":"jeremy-oreilly","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"MX Logic","permalink":"mx-logic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0005/8184/58184v1-max-150x150.png"],[[153,100],"assets/images/resized/0005/8184/58184v1-max-250x250.png"],[[153,100],"assets/images/resized/0005/8184/58184v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MX Force","permalink":"mx-force","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"SpamStopsHere","permalink":"spamstopshere","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2657 Windmill Pkwy #175","address2":"","zip_code":"89074","city":"Henderson","state_code":"NV","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/0076/60076v2-max-150x150.png"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/0076/60076v2-max-250x250.png"],[[448,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/0076/60076v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
