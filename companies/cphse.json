CPHSE have started out by building a generic information extraction tool, that can extract the information from pieces of text (emails in this case), and show them to the companies in a new top-down approach.\nInstead of reading hundreds of emails with nearly the same information, the information is grouped together, and you search, navigate and browse through the actual aggregated data, not the emails.</p>\n\n<p>Going forward, the company expects to be able to provide both a Social aspect and a Business Intelligence aspect to from the platform.</p>\n\n<p>The company lease the information extraction technology to other software companies using a SaaS solution. Primarily the companies using this, are from within the shipping industry or mail system collaboration providers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0018/0389/180389v2-max-150x150.png"],[[176,58],"assets/images/resized/0018/0389/180389v2-max-250x250.png"],[[176,58],"assets/images/resized/0018/0389/180389v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Morten","last_name":"Sondergaard","permalink":"morten-sondergaard-4","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0018/1304/181304v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0018/1304/181304v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,262],"assets/images/resized/0018/1304/181304v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0018/1305/181305v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0018/1305/181305v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,319],"assets/images/resized/0018/1305/181305v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
