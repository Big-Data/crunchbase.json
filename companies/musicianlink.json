Musicians, singers and songwriters with a high-speed Internet connection are now able to collaborate without sacrificing audio quality or accounting for latency.</p>\n\n<p>The jamLink requires a high-speed Internet connection, a web browser and headphones. There is no software to install; third party hardware or software to configure and troubleshoot; or subscription to maintain. The jamLink is equipped with an Ethernet port that connects it to the network and is controlled by software hosted by your computerâ€™s web browser. Once users log into MusicianLink.com, they can manage and initiate the jamLink sessions as easily as starting a chat session.</p>\n\n<p>MusicianLink.com is a jamLink social network. Like other social networks you can find and make friends, and connect with other musicians of similar talent and interests. Each jamLink user creates a profile and is able to search for compatible partners based on music style, instrument and ability. MusicianLink.com friends can share MP3 files, chat, and post messages. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0006/6599/66599v11-max-150x150.png"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0006/6599/66599v11-max-250x250.png"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0006/6599/66599v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"jamLink","permalink":"jamlink","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Willyard","permalink":"david-willyard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"McKenna","permalink":"sean-mckenna","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"eJamming","permalink":"ejamming","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/8576/38576v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/8576/38576v1-max-250x250.png"],[[347,83],"assets/images/resized/0003/8576/38576v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0006/6596/66596v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0006/6596/66596v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,310],"assets/images/resized/0006/6596/66596v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/6597/66597v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0006/6597/66597v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,275],"assets/images/resized/0006/6597/66597v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0006/6598/66598v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0006/6598/66598v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,294],"assets/images/resized/0006/6598/66598v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
