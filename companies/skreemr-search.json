Skreemr does not host any of their music, instead it indexes publicly accessible audio files across the internet, and plays them through their own music player. Skreemr uses a unique &#8220;AudioRank&#8221; algorithm, to place higher quality audio files towards the top of the search results. The site design is simple, slightly resembling the Google&#8217;s clean home page. Users can mouse over links to see more metadata, although you cannot create playlists.
