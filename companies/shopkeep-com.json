Backed by the industry’s best customer support, ShopKeep’s iPad app rings sales, prints receipts, and processes credit cards.  It also manages inventory, reports, and customers from anywhere and without extra hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Bridging the gap between dated retail systems and advanced cloud technology, ShopKeep® provides mass customization and alternative to common payment platforms.  ShopKeep® is a software as a service (SaaS), offering scalable pricing for all merchants, including leading unlimited support, as well as hardware to fit each store’s needs.</p>\n\n<p>ShopKeep® replaces traditional expensive point of sale terminals with an easy to use, high-end technology that stores all data in the cloud.  Because of the low up-front cost (under $1,000 for all hardware including an iPad), ShopKeep® is also a financially viable alternative to a basic cash register.</p>\n\n<p>ShopKeep® comprises two parts: (1) front-end cash register interface for iPad or Mac; and (2) a ‘BackOffice’ website where all transaction data is located and available for store owners and managers to view from any web browser.  The register front-end is synced with the BackOffice, which provides full reports and QuickBooks integration for real-time accurate reports with the click of a button.  Finally, a store owner can run their store without being stuck in it</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0007/4175/74175v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/4175/74175v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/4175/74175v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"Bennett","permalink":"amy-bennett","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Richelson","permalink":"jason-richelson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO/Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Olk","permalink":"david-olk","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Sandhya","last_name":"Rao","permalink":"sandhya-rao","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"Bennett","permalink":"amy-bennett-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Bensamoun","permalink":"jonathan-bensamoun","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Walton","permalink":"bill-walton","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Cameron","last_name":"Peek","permalink":"cameron-peek","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"MerchantOS","permalink":"merchantos","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0001/1526/11526v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/1526/11526v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[279,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/1526/11526v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Square","permalink":"square","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-150x150.png"],[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-250x250.png"],[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Vend","permalink":"vendhq","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0008/0355/80355v9-max-150x150.png"],[[178,100],"assets/images/resized/0008/0355/80355v9-max-250x250.png"],[[178,100],"assets/images/resized/0008/0355/80355v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Cashier Live","permalink":"cashier-live","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0007/6351/76351v2-max-150x150.png"],[[218,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/6351/76351v2-max-250x250.png"],[[218,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/6351/76351v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/01/17/shopkeep-raises-2-2-million-for-web-based-ipad-cash-register/","source_description":"Wall Street Journal Blog","raised_amount":2200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":17,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New York City","address1":"55 Broad Street","address2":"","zip_code":"10004","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Integrates with Shopify.com for multi channel retail!
