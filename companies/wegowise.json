The principals behind WegoWise founded the business after recognizing the need for an efficiency benchmarking and performance verification system that is quick, inexpensive, and easy-to-use.  WegoWise is web-based and accommodates multi-family buildings, single-family homes, and niche commercial applications.  The WegoWise platform automatically tracks a property’s utility consumption, adjusts for a building’s climate and construction variations, provides performance benchmarks, identifies areas of improvement, and verifies savings from building upgrades.  Analysis can be performed across an entire portfolio, within a particular development, on a specific building, and at the level of individual units.   </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0019/3479/193479v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0019/3479/193479v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,127],"assets/images/resized/0019/3479/193479v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Edwards Wildman","permalink":"edwards-wildman","image":null}},{"title":"Accounting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Alexander, Aronson, Finning","permalink":"alexander-aronson-finning","image":null}},{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Green Machine PR","permalink":"green-machine-pr","image":null}},{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"The Antenna Group","permalink":"the-antenna-group","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$1.9M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1900000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Boston Community Capital","permalink":"boston-community-capital","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Boston Office","address1":"201 South Street","address2":"Suite 616","zip_code":"02111","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,147],"assets/images/resized/0018/8062/188062v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0018/8062/188062v2-max-250x250.png"],[[420,414],"assets/images/resized/0018/8062/188062v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0018/8063/188063v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,135],"assets/images/resized/0018/8063/188063v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,244],"assets/images/resized/0018/8063/188063v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0018/8064/188064v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/8064/188064v2-max-250x250.png"],[[416,333],"assets/images/resized/0018/8064/188064v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0018/8065/188065v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,112],"assets/images/resized/0018/8065/188065v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,201],"assets/images/resized/0018/8065/188065v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0018/8066/188066v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0018/8066/188066v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,273],"assets/images/resized/0018/8066/188066v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0019/3480/193480v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0019/3480/193480v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,255],"assets/images/resized/0019/3480/193480v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
