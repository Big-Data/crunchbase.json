Fusion Ads can be integrated with mobile applications to deliver relevant advertisements over-the-air. The proprietary technology can also capture critical demographical information as users sign in to content providing sites, and organize them into a systematic database that will allow the system to dispense the most compelling advertisements to smartphone users.</p>\n\n<p>Fusion Ads has entered a Joint Venture with TheMobileGamer and has created a new product called Appchemy (http://www.appchemy.com). Appchemy has been accepted strongly in the market, with MOUs signed with regional content providers, developers and distribution partners. More than 60 games currently use the Appchemy platform.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0020/8916/208916v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0020/8916/208916v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,174],"assets/images/resized/0020/8916/208916v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Alvin","last_name":"Yap","permalink":"alvin-yap-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Chan","permalink":"nicholas-chan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8515/28515v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/8515/28515v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[242,290],"assets/images/resized/0002/8515/28515v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$50k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Chan","permalink":"nicholas-chan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8515/28515v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/8515/28515v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[242,290],"assets/images/resized/0002/8515/28515v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":{"name":"Azione Capital Pte Ltd","permalink":"azione-capital-pte-ltd","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
