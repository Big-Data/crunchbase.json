We bring educators, students and parents together to understand and master the Common Core.  Our mastery tracking of Common Core and state standards is powerful, simple, social, and real-time.  </p>\n\n<p>For teachers, our innovative and time-saving assessment tools make formative assessment simple and efficient.  They can electronically grade assessments taken on the iPod or iPad app, and correct plain-paper answer sheets in seconds by simply scanning into the system using their webcam, saving many hours each week.</p>\n\n<p>The visual tracking of standards-based performance provides teachers and administrators a real-time understanding of what students know and don&#8217;t know relative to the core.  This provides actionable data regarding which students need targeted instruction, or formal intervention.</p>\n\n<p>A powerful and intuitive parent dashboard helps parents quickly understand each core standard and what their child knows relative to each standard.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0013/4820/134820v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0013/4820/134820v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/4820/134820v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Trenton","last_name":"Goble","permalink":"trenton-goble","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Mick","last_name":"Hewitt","permalink":"mick-hewitt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Doug","last_name":"Weber","permalink":"doug-weber","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Cory","last_name":"Reid","permalink":"cory-reid","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Caldwell","permalink":"brad-caldwell","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"Knighton","permalink":"jennifer-knighton","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.25M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"Co-Founders","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.newschools.org/news/masteryconnect","source_description":"","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":5,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"NewSchools Venture Fund","permalink":"the-new-schools-venture-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0008/0795/80795v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0008/0795/80795v4-max-250x250.png"],[[400,89],"assets/images/resized/0008/0795/80795v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Learn Capital","permalink":"learn-capital","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"175 West 200 South","address2":"Suite 1004","zip_code":"84101","city":"Salt Lake City","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<video class=\"video-js\" width=\"430\" height=\"242\" preload=\"\" style=\"height: 242px;
