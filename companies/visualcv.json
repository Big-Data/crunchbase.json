A VisualCV allows professionals to easily build and manage an online career portfolio that comes alive with informational keyword pop-ups, video, pictures, and professional networking. VisualCV.com enables secure sharing of VisualCVs for networking, career advancement and business development.  </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Powered by VisualCV&#8221; is a private-label technology platform that enables organizations to privately brand and manage VisualCVs within a membership community.   &#8220;Powered by Visual CV&#8221; is available via annual license under a SaaS model that provides a faster route to market with no IT overhead.  </p>\n\n<p>Based in Reston, Virginia, the company has received investments from Heidrick &amp; Struggles (Nasdaq: HSII) and Valhalla Partners.
