The contents of any attached USB drive are automatically backed up online without the need for any user intervention or PC client software, thus ridding users of the tedious and expensive task of setting up a dedicated file server and managing the backup process.</p>\n\n<p>CTERA Networks was founded by Liran Eshel and Zohar Kaufman, seasoned entrepreneurs and software pioneers who previously led SofaWare Technologies, a Check Point company, from early incubation to a prime position in the small business network security appliance market.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0003/3171/33171v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0003/3171/33171v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0003/3171/33171v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"CloudPlug","permalink":"cloudplug","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
