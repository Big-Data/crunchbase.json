The company is located in Freiburg in Breisgau. Concentrix Solar further developed the Concentrator PV technology generated from many years of research work at Fraunhofer ISE and brought it from the laboratory to market ready products and advanced it into series production. Under the name FLATCONÂ®, we offer complete, turnkey concentrator photovoltaic power plants on the commercial level.</p>\n\n<p>For introducing the FLATCONÂ® technology into the Spanish and Portuguese markets, the subsidiary Concentrix Iberia was founded  in February 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Concentrix Solar is well equipped for further dynamic growth.</p>\n\n<p>From September 2006 until August 2008, Concentrix Solar operated a pilot production line for manufacturing its concentrator modules. In September 2008, a fully automatic production line with a production capacity of 25 MW was put in operation for this purpose. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/0748/70748v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,121],"assets/images/resized/0007/0748/70748v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,121],"assets/images/resized/0007/0748/70748v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"HansjÃ¶rg","last_name":"LerchenmÃ¼ller","permalink":"hansjrg-lerchenmller","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Karl","last_name":"Friedrich Haarburger","permalink":"karl-friedrich-haarburger","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Gombert","permalink":"andreas-gombert","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":79000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"stock","source_url":"http://cleantechbrief.com/node/1188?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cleantechbrief%2Frss+(CleanTech+Brief)","source_description":"Soitec Acquires Concentrix Solar","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":12,"acquired_day":21,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Soitec Group","permalink":"soitec-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/0744/70744v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/0744/70744v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/0744/70744v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"BÃ¶tzinger Str. 31","address2":"","zip_code":"79111 ","city":"Freiburg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0007/0747/70747v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0007/0747/70747v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0007/0747/70747v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
