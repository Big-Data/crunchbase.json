Its products include Fully Synchronous DRAM, which is designed to allow precise timing from a DRAM system; Dual Edge Clocking that is designed to allow data to be sent on the clock pulse; Variable Burst Length, which is designed to improve data transfer efficiency by allowing varying amounts of data to be sent per a memory read or write request in DRAMs and flash memory; FlexPhase technology that synchronizes data output and compensates for circuit timing errors; and Channel Equalization, which is designed to improve signal integrity and system margins by reducing inter-symbol interference in high speed parallel and serial link channels. The company also licenses its leadership architectures and chip interfaces for use in semiconductor and system products, including XDR Memory Architecture, which enables the production of DRAM; XDR2 Memory Architecture that includes DRAM micro-threading for graphics intensive applications, such as gaming and digital video; RDRAM Memory, which is used in play stations, Intel-based personal computers, televisions, and routers; and FlexIO processor bus, a high speed chip-to-chip interface, as well as provides digital logic controllers for PCI Express, DDRx memory, and other interfaces. Its products are used in computing, gaming and graphics, and consumer electronics applications, as well as in personal computers, servers, printers, video projectors, game consoles, digital TVs, set-top boxes, and mobile phones. Rambus Inc. was founded in 1990 and is headquartered in Los Altos, California.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[139,63],"assets/images/resized/0005/0195/50195v2-max-150x150.png"],[[139,63],"assets/images/resized/0005/0195/50195v2-max-250x250.png"],[[139,63],"assets/images/resized/0005/0195/50195v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Harold","last_name":"E.
