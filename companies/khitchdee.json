It&#8217;s custom designed to help us run Khitchdee. Running Khitchdee is mostly building gadgets. Using the Switch a student can build gadgets. Through it we teach students our design techniques. Teaching-learning is our first domain focus. Students design custom gadgets for themselves. Replacing their laptops with their own designs. Over time the design process simplifies, and we grow a palette of design techniques. Then we can franchise out our design techniques to franchisees who design gadgets for clients. We take their gadget designs and produce them. Slowly we grow a network of franchisees. </p>\n\n<p>The first product we are producing is a software agent that starts out in a studio. We interface with it completely through sound. We have mics in the studio for the input and speakers for corresponding sound output. This agent helps us to make simple music. To simplify our music making process, we fix the rhythm for the entire session. The agent helps us capture a tuning drone, then a percussive rhythm timing sequence. We build a synth that can shift pitch and timing. After we have stored tuning and timing loops, we are ready to make music in rhythm. As soon as we say something, our sound agent recognizes our pitch and our tempo speed. It then generates a drone at our native pitch and a rhythm pattern fixed to our tempo.  Subsequently we can make music in sync. In the session we can also make changes to the tuning and timing parameters as well as to the sound mix through the speakers. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0021/6067/216067v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0021/6067/216067v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,55],"assets/images/resized/0021/6067/216067v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Inck.exe","permalink":"inck-exe","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rohit","last_name":"Agarwal","permalink":"rohit-agarwal-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Trainee","person":{"first_name":"Deepak","last_name":"Kumar","permalink":"deepak-kumar-5","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Trainee","person":{"first_name":"Sovan","last_name":"Kumar Nayak","permalink":"sovan-kumar-nayak","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Dell","permalink":"dell","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/3510/13510v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/3510/13510v5-max-250x250.png"],[[432,432],"assets/images/resized/0001/3510/13510v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1 Bank Road","address2":"","zip_code":"211002","city":"Allahabad","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thetechpanda.com/khitchdee-a-startup-that-makes-customized-gadgets-daring-to-take-the-path-less-travelled/","title":"The Tech Panda Interview"}]}
