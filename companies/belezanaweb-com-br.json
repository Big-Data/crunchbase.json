The main points of sale that appeal to its customer base are free shipping, shop credit on first purchase and the ability of paying in installments (a practice very common in Brazil).</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2006 by Alex Serodio, son of cosmetics businessman Ademar Serodio, the company grew at a steady pace until 2010. In 2011, with the E-Commerce 2.0 Bubble in Brazil, a series of events helped bring BelezanaWeb to the heart of the country&#8217;s bustling start-up scene: firstly, two of its current partners - Lucas Mendes and Felipe Mansano - joined the team, coming from Bain &amp; Company and Goldman Sachs. A few months later, they brought the funding of Tiger Global Management and Kaszek Ventures, who made their first investment in the company in August 2011. Later on, Fernando Nawa, former IT director at Walmart.com.br, also joined BelezanaWeb as CTO.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0018/0509/180509v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0018/0509/180509v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,264],"assets/images/resized/0018/0509/180509v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alexandre","last_name":"Serodio","permalink":"alexandre-serodio","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"Mansano","permalink":"felipe-mansano","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Mendes","permalink":"lucas-mendes","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"Nawa","permalink":"fernando-nawa","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Sack's","permalink":"sacks-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Folica.com","permalink":"folica-com","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"BeautyBar.com","permalink":"beautybar-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0010/7743/107743v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0010/7743/107743v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,61],"assets/images/resized/0010/7743/107743v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"FeelUnique.com","permalink":"feelunique-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Rua Doutor Bacelar, 368","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sao Paulo","state_code":null,"country_code":"BRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://br.kekanto.com/biz/beleza-na-web-3","title":"BelezanaWeb profile on Kekanto (Brazil's Yelp)"},{"external_url":"http://www.ebit.com.br/beleza-na-web","title":"BelezanaWeb's EBIT rating"}]}
