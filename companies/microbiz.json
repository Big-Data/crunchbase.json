In March 2012, the business spun out of CAM Commerce Solutions LLC, an established vendor of retail management software.  MicroBiz is owned and led by Kevin T. Kogler, the former President of CAM Commerce.  The business is based in Menlo Park CA, with a development facility in Las Vegas NV.   MicroBiz currently markets MicroBiz Business Controller, a Windows-based point of sale software solution with well over 2,000 active users.  </p>\n\n<p>In August 2012, MicroBiz will be launching MicroBiz Online, a completely new web-based integrated point of sale/eCommerce software as a service (SaaS) targeted at local multi-channel merchants.  MicroBiz Online will combine easy to use yet feature rich web-based point of sale software with the popular Magento Community eCommerce platform.  This completely integrated solution will enable local multi-channel retailers to operate their retail stores and eCommerce sites with a single Cloud-based management system â€“ including unified product records, customer records, inventory management and reporting. </p>\n\n<p>MicroBiz Online point of sale will allow any of the 100,000+ merchants running a Magento Community eCommerce site the ability to seamlessly &#8216;plug in&#8217;  their offline brick and mortar store with their online operations without the need for any custom integration or middleware.  This tight integration eliminates the need to do double data entry or manage two sets of customer or inventory records.  It will also customers go leverage the power of the Magento Connect Community and open source technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The product will be offered on a subscription basis, with no license fee upfront and a monthly subscription fee.  </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Kogler","permalink":"kevin-kogler","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"MerchantOS","permalink":"merchantos","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0001/1526/11526v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/1526/11526v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[279,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/1526/11526v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ERPLY","permalink":"erply","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0006/0817/60817v2-max-150x150.png"],[[167,77],"assets/images/resized/0006/0817/60817v2-max-250x250.png"],[[167,77],"assets/images/resized/0006/0817/60817v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Cashier Live","permalink":"cashier-live","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0007/6351/76351v2-max-150x150.png"],[[218,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/6351/76351v2-max-250x250.png"],[[218,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/6351/76351v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ShopKeep.com","permalink":"shopkeep-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0007/4175/74175v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/4175/74175v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/4175/74175v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"POSLavu","permalink":"poslavu","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0012/8090/128090v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[151,75],"assets/images/resized/0012/8090/128090v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[151,75],"assets/images/resized/0012/8090/128090v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Development Center","address1":"285 E.
