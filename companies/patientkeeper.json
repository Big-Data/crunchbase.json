Since then, PatientKeeper has grown to become the leading physician information system provider.</p>\n\n<p>And for good reason.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1998, we&#8217;ve helped healthcare organizations cost-effectively deliver information where it&#8217;s needed most to enhance patient care and safety, reduce costs, improve staff productivity and increase revenue.</p>\n\n<p>We offer the industry&#8217;s only suite of applications that support physicians throughout their entire day â€” enabling them to review electronic patient records&#8230;write prescriptions&#8230;enter charges&#8230;dictate notes&#8230;document encounters&#8230;place orders&#8230;even consult with other caregivers â€” wherever they are. Our software addresses physician needs across virtually any device â€” ranging from handhelds to Smartphones to tablets, to laptops to desktop computers, so that whether they&#8217;re reviewing test results in their office, in the car or at the bedside, they&#8217;re covered.</p>\n\n<p>PatientKeeper customers can start with just a single application and add new capabilities as needed â€” with PatientKeeper all our applications are tightly integrated with each other. And because our platform integrates with existing healthcare systems, there&#8217;s no need to replace legacy systems.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0003/1129/31129v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0003/1129/31129v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[256,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/1129/31129v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"S.
