It is developing the partially reusable launch vehicles Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. Originally based in El Segundo, SpaceX now operates out of Hawthorne, California, USA.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX was founded in June 2002 by Musk who had invested $100 million of his own money in the company as of March 2006. In January 2005, SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX had 160 employees in November 2005, and more than 500 by July 2008. The launch crew in the Marshall Islands has 25 people, 6 in mission control. This small number, compared to similar space launch companies, is part of cost reduction. Musk sees other space-launch services&#8217; high prices as supporting unnecessary bureaucracy. He&#8217;s stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space by a factor of ten.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk stated after the failure of the third Falcon 1 flight attempt, &#8220;As a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit, SpaceX recently accepted a significant investment. Combined with our existing cash reserves, that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching Falcon 1 and develop Falcon 9 and Dragon&#8221;; on August 4, SpaceX released further details; they had accepted a USD$20 million equity investment from the Founder&#8217;s Fund.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2002, the SpaceX team now numbers over 500, located primarily in Hawthorne, California, with four additional locations: SpaceX&#8217;s Texas Test Facility in McGregor near Waco; offices in Washington DC; and launch facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-150x150.png"],[[221,30],"assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-250x250.png"],[[221,30],"assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Elon","last_name":"Musk","permalink":"elon-musk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/5849/25849v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0002/5849/25849v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,232],"assets/images/resized/0002/5849/25849v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elon<em>Musk</em>in<em>Mission</em>Control_at_SpaceX.jpg</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Bret","last_name":"Johnsen","permalink":"bret-johnsen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Gwynne","last_name":"Shotwell","permalink":"gwynne-shotwell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Jurvetson","permalink":"steve-jurvetson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,148],"assets/images/resized/0003/8057/38057v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,148],"assets/images/resized/0003/8057/38057v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,148],"assets/images/resized/0003/8057/38057v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Kimbal","last_name":"Musk","permalink":"kimbal-musk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0004/6217/46217v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,244],"assets/images/resized/0004/6217/46217v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,292],"assets/images/resized/0004/6217/46217v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>lauriesmithphoto.com</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"XCOR
