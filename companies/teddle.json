Our platform gives them free access to the tools that they need to manage their business professionally. These include a simple place to manage their customers, assess their business performance, and through our booking engine manage their diary. We offer our service providers a profile page that acts as their shop window to the local community.</p>\n\n<p>With traditional hyperlocal listing sites the provider lists their services and then rarely returns and there is no ongoing reason for them to be engaged. Teddle is different, it becomes the day to day management tool for these small businesses meaning they are constantly interacting with Teddle making it an active local community hub. Teddle includes a review section, but the main instrument of trust is the Teddle reputation score. This is based on good behaviour on the site and also repeat bookings.</p>\n\n<p>Teddle is rapidly growing across London and we will be adding even more features to help small businesses such as online payment and invoicing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0019/9230/199230v2-max-150x150.png"],[[155,60],"assets/images/resized/0019/9230/199230v2-max-250x250.png"],[[155,60],"assets/images/resized/0019/9230/199230v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Depledge","permalink":"alex-depledge","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jules","last_name":"Coleman","permalink":"jules-coleman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/9229/199229v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/9229/199229v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/9229/199229v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ton","last_name":"Nimmo","permalink":"ton-nimmo","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$23k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/04/17/meet-the-teams-working-with-springboard-for-its-london-accelerator-program/","source_description":"Springboard","raised_amount":23000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":2,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Teddle Headquarters","address1":"Google Campus","address2":"Old Street","zip_code":"EC2A 4BX","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0019/8813/198813v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0019/8813/198813v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0019/8813/198813v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
