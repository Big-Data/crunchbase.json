To add a bottle to the E-Cellar, users simply search CorkSavvyâ€™s database, find the wine they are looking for, and click â€œchoose this bottle;â€ or they can quickly fill out an online form to add a bottle manually. Whatâ€™s more, wine lovers can upload photos of their bottles and write entries in a private Wine Journal to record the occasion or meal in which they enjoyed a bottle in their E-Cellar.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Savvy Reporter: The editors at CorkSavvy, led by Editorial Director Jill Sloane, compose original feature articles about wine (in the section titled â€œOur Savvy Reporterâ€), recommend a great bottle every week (â€œJillâ€™s Wine of the Weekâ€), conduct interviews with winemakers and sommeliers, offer wine-and-food-pairing suggestions, and respond to questions from readers (in the already popular â€œAsk CorkSavvyâ€ column). Every week, these stories and tips are also sent to mailing list subscribers as part of the CorkSavvy Newsletter.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Wine News: CorkSavvyâ€™s editorial team compiles the best wine-related articles and news items from around the world and posts a daily list of links to keep visitors in the know.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Restaurant Wine Lists: For wine enthusiasts looking to enjoy a bottle at a restaurant in their own city or while traveling, CorkSavvy has, for the first time on the web, made the wine lists of <em>#</em> restaurants around the world available in one place. In the â€œRestaurant Wine Listsâ€ section, users can search by name and location, find a restaurant, and then simply click â€œViewâ€ to be directed to the wine list on the restaurantâ€™s own web site (thus ensuring that the information is as up-to-date as possible).</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Global Winery Directory: With the Global Winery Directory, users can search the worldâ€™s wineries by name, country, region, and more. Each wineryâ€™s profile includes contact information, a link to the web site, a list of wines produced, and special features like â€œCertified Organic.â€ </p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Bottle Search: Getting more granular than the Global Winery Directory, the Bottle Search feature gives users access to detailed information on individual bottles of wine (for example, through the Winery Directory you might look up and learn about Cakebread Cellars, and in the Bottle Search you might search for Cakebreadâ€™s 2002 Merlot). In addition to finding the vintage, region, and grapes for each bottle, users can add bottles to their E-Cellar with the click of a button (specifically, the â€œAdd to Cellarâ€ button).</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Events Calendar: Since getting savvy about wine also requires oenophiles to step away from the keyboard and taste some juice, CorkSavvy offers a calendar of noteworthy wine-related events around the world.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Mobile Capabilities and Facebook: CorkSavvyâ€™s robust collection of features is available to wine lovers who are on the move, tooâ€”by downloading the mobile version of CorkSavvy, users can access all of the siteâ€™s content, including the E-Cellar application, from anywhere. In fact, users can even snap a photo of a bottle with an iPhone or other Smartphone, email it to CorkSavvy, and then it will be available for use in their E-Cellar. And recognizing the social function of wine, CorkSavvy has created a Facebook application that allows users to update and share the contents of their E-Cellars from right within Facebook. In the short time that the CorkSavvy Facebook application has been available, more than 5,000 Facebook users have downloaded it.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Editorial Director","person":{"first_name":"Jill","last_name":"Sloane","permalink":"jill-sloane","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"WineLog.net","permalink":"winelog-net","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/1729/1729v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1729/1729v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1729/1729v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Snooth Media","permalink":"snooth","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/0409/409v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/0409/409v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/0409/409v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"application development, marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"4elbows, LLC","permalink":"4elbows-llc","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
