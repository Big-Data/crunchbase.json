All of them are mostly powered by non-renewable polluting â€œbrownâ€ electricity, which is one of the major causes of global warming. </p>\n\n<p>On your behalf, Greenscroll invests into green renewable energy projects, thus increasing the supply of green energy and therefore decreasing demand for polluting non-renewable sources. In other words, Greenscroll helps pump green energy into the grid to power websites.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, your web presence becomes environmentally friendly, while your footprint is virtually reduced to zero â€” and visitors will recognize that fact by the Greenscroll certificate on your site.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/6177/56177v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0005/6177/56177v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[255,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/6177/56177v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Communications Scroller","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Carson","permalink":"john-carson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/6196/56196v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/6196/56196v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[344,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/6196/56196v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Chief Scroller","person":{"first_name":"Nikolai","last_name":"Bratkovski","permalink":"nikolai-bratkovski","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/6915/56915v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/6915/56915v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/6915/56915v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Tech Scroller","person":{"first_name":"Sasha","last_name":"Baksht","permalink":"sasha-bakcht","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"CO2Stats","permalink":"co2stats","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/3665/23665v3-max-150x150.png"],[[246,74],"assets/images/resized/0002/3665/23665v3-max-250x250.png"],[[246,74],"assets/images/resized/0002/3665/23665v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"121 Limestone Cres.","address2":"","zip_code":"M3J 2R1","city":"Toronto","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":43.7800889,"longitude":-79.4886401}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0005/6175/56175v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,222],"assets/images/resized/0005/6175/56175v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,400],"assets/images/resized/0005/6175/56175v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0005/6176/56176v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,225],"assets/images/resized/0005/6176/56176v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,405],"assets/images/resized/0005/6176/56176v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/08/greenscroll-and-shrinking-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet.php","title":"TreeHugger"},{"external_url":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/aug/10/greenscroll-website-carbon-offset","title":"The Guardian.co.uk"}]}
