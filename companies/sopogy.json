Our products include SopoFlare, SopoNova, SopoHelios, SopoTitan, SopoLite, and the SopoSoft operating system.  We sell to original equipment manufacturers who use our products to enhance theirs, the Independent Power Producers who use our systems to generate base load energy, the Oil &amp; Gas industry who use our technologies to generate fossil fuel free solar steam and the Commercial &amp; Industrial sector who use our solutions as an energy efficiency alternative.    </p>\n\n<p>In nearly all of our thermal energy markets, Sopogy&#8217;s MicroCSP systems have the shortest paybacks of all other commercialized solar options.  This is achieved thru our patented concentrating technology using mirrors with optics. Our technology platform enables us to produce a low cost but highly efficient solar collector.  We combine that with our low cost thermal storage solution and plant software which enable low cost installation.  Low costs with high efficiencies equal low paybacks. </p>\n\n<p>MicroCSP technologies are used to create Process Heat, Solar Air Conditioning or Electrical Power and can be ground or rooftop mounted opening an entirely new market for CSP systems.   For more information on the technology visit our How It Works page. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/0159/100159v2-max-150x150.png"],[[153,46],"assets/images/resized/0010/0159/100159v2-max-250x250.png"],[[153,46],"assets/images/resized/0010/0159/100159v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Darren","last_name":"Kimura","permalink":"darren-kimura-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Lobdell","permalink":"craig-lobdell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Corporate Accounts","person":{"first_name":"Brody","last_name":"McMurtry","permalink":"brody-mcmurtry","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO, VP Administration","person":{"first_name":"Tsurumi","last_name":"Hamasu","permalink":"tsurumi-hamasu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Finance","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Shimada","permalink":"ken-shimada","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Loo","permalink":"michael-loo","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Manufacturing","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Norvelle","permalink":"jim-norvelle","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP","person":{"first_name":"Tal","last_name":"Ziv","permalink":"tal-ziv-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Terry","last_name":"Revnak","permalink":"terry-revnak","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$17.4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2002,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":5,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Darren","last_name":"T.
