RFML is so powerful that Red Foundry&#8217;s own modules are built using it. And during development, stakeholders can experience apps live on actual hardware, something unavailable with any other solution.</p>\n\n<p>Deploy apps to the app store with one click (pending Apple&#8217;s approval, of course), and then manage them with a comprehensive suite of analytics, push notification, and other tools. Altogether, it&#8217;s a comprehensive and flexible platform for creating and managing any sort of mobile app. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/8789/108789v1-max-150x150.png"],[[199,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/8789/108789v1-max-250x250.png"],[[199,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/8789/108789v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Newman","permalink":"andrew-newman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Heising","permalink":"jim-heising","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & COO","person":{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"Franczyk","permalink":"ron-franczyk","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"Dwyer","permalink":"joe-dwyer","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Dwyer","permalink":"joseph-dwyer","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2010/11/03/red-foundry-lands-1-1m-to-let-anyone-make-mobile-apps-like-pros/","source_description":"Red Foundry lands $1.1M to let anyone make mobile apps like a pro","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":3,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"500\" height=\"306\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Vd_2Z711Pc0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Vd_2Z711Pc0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"500\" height=\"306\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Red Foundry intro</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/11997394\" width=\"400\" height=\"405\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/11997394\">Red Foundry Radio</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/codis\">Jim Heising</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Red Foundry radio app</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/15412384\" width=\"400\" height=\"490\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15412384\">More LiveMag from Red Foundry</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/codis\">Jim Heising</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Red Foundry livemagazine app</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
