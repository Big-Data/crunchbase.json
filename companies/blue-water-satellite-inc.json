Using satellite data obtained in 30m x 30m resolution, BWSI provides the equivalent of 4.6 samples per surface acre of a body of water, at a rate much more cost-effective and much more thorough than lab analysis of water samples or instrument monitoring.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/8909/158909v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,214],"assets/images/resized/0015/8909/158909v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[209,214],"assets/images/resized/0015/8909/158909v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Total Phosphorous Analysis of Water","permalink":"total-phosphorous-analysis-of-water","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Milt","last_name":"Baker","permalink":"milt-baker-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"440 East Poe Rd.","address2":"","zip_code":"43402","city":"Bowling Green","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/8908/158908v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/8908/158908v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[447,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/8908/158908v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.BlueWaterSatellite.com","title":"Home Page"}]}
