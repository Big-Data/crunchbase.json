There&#8217;s nothing to clip, nothing to print.</p>\n\n<p>Providing exclusive eCoupons redeemable at over 24,000 grocery and drug stores throughout the country, SavingStar&#8217;s eCoupons are linked to customers&#8217; loyalty cards and offer a more convenient and eco-friendly way to save on groceries than paper grocery coupons. SavingStar automatically adds the value of each eCoupon redeemed into users&#8217; SavingStar accounts, enabling them to pick their payout from cash to gift cards to charity donations.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to founding SavingStar, CEO David Rochon and President Michael Libenson built the grocery segment for Upromise.com enabling eCoupons for its 13 million members who save for college. SavingStarâ€™s founding team spun off from Upromise in 2010, and the company now also powers Upromise&#8217;s Grocery eCoupons.</p>\n\n<p>SavingStar is based in Waltham,
