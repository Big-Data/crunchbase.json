GooodJob believes that no company should have to settle and that introducing effective motivation tactics and social media tools spurs total employee involvement and maximizes participation.  </p>\n\n<p>We enable companies to engage and motivate employees in a smart way which recognizes and rewards all of their referral efforts, not just the end-results. This promotes company-wide enthusiasm and drives long-term commitment. And our sophisticated social media tools help companies securely tap into employees&#8217; extensive Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter networks without compromising their privacy. This multiplies access to passive candidates, and spreads companies&#8217; employer branding messages to a broader audience.</p>\n\n<p>In short, GooodJob benefits organizations by significantly increasing their ROI, broadening their reach to relevant candidates, helping them maintain a strong social media presence, and introducing innovative developments to employees, candidates and management.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0018/5015/185015v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0018/5015/185015v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0018/5015/185015v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Assaf","last_name":"Eisenstein","permalink":"assaf-eisenstein","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Yaniv","last_name":"Sharon","permalink":"yaniv-sharon","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Laurie","last_name":"Spieler","permalink":"laurie-spieler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Sigal","last_name":"Srur","permalink":"sigal-srur","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Gigi","last_name":"Levy","permalink":"gigi-levy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0004/7144/47144v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0004/7144/47144v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0004/7144/47144v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Gigi Levy</p>"}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"We're proud to announce that GooodJob has been chosen as a finalist in the first-ever startup competition at the Recruiting Innovation Summit on May 17, 2012 – with a chance to win the grand prize of $10,000!\r\n\r\nOut of almost 50 companies which applied we","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":24,"source_url":"http://recruitinginnovationsummit.com/mv2012/#startup-competition","source_text":null,"source_description":"Finalist in Recruiting Innovation Summit Startup Competition","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"GooodJob","permalink":"gooodjob"}},{"description":"We're thrilled to announce that GooodJob has won second place in the startup competition at the Recruiting Innovation Summit!","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":17,"source_url":"http://www.personneltoday.com/blogs/press-release-service/2012/05/gooodjob-wins-second-place-in-international-startup-competition.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"GooodJob Wins Second Place in International Startup Competition","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"GooodJob","permalink":"gooodjob"}},{"description":"GooodJob has released a free Facebook career tab which enables organizations to reach top talent directly from their Facebook pages.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":4,"source_url":"http://apps.facebook.com/freecareertab","source_text":null,"source_description":"GooodJob Releases Free Facebook Career Tab","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"GooodJob","permalink":"gooodjob"}},{"description":"GooodJob is a finalist in the iHR 2012 tech startup competition to be held at the HR Tech Europe Conference.
