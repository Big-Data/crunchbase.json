The organizations then develop short proposals explaining how they will utilize the products. Corporations and individuals in turn fund the most promising proposals in order to make them a reality.  </p>\n\n<p>Kopernik&#8217;s goal is to accelerate development through â€˜leapfroggingâ€™ or skipping inferior, less-efficient technologies and practices, and moving directly to more advanced ones. Kopernik&#8217;s co-founders are former UN workers.  </p>\n\n<p>Kopernik&#8217;s model is similar to DonorsChoose.org with a focus on technology for developing countries. \nÂ </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0007/8793/78793v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0007/8793/78793v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,238],"assets/images/resized/0007/8793/78793v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ewa","last_name":"Wojkowska","permalink":"ewa-wojkowska","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,109],"assets/images/resized/0011/6684/116684v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[243,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/6684/116684v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[243,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/6684/116684v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Toshi","last_name":"Nakamura","permalink":"toshi-nakamura","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,109],"assets/images/resized/0011/6682/116682v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[243,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/6682/116682v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[243,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/6682/116682v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer","person":{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"Wijaya","permalink":"irene-widjaya","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0011/6685/116685v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[233,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/6685/116685v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[233,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/6685/116685v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"44 Butler Place","address2":"APT 6C","zip_code":"11238","city":"Brooklyn","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0007/8792/78792v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,134],"assets/images/resized/0007/8792/78792v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,242],"assets/images/resized/0007/8792/78792v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.gizmag.com/kopernik-technology-charity-ngo/14329/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2010/02/25/kopernik/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+brainpickings/rss+(Brain+Pickings)","title":""}]}
