Gnzo released the free iPhone app &#8220;Gnzo&#8221; in February 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Our company was founded by Toshikazu Shinohara as Gunzoo, Inc. in February 2010. At &#8220;TechCrunch DISRUPT San Francisco&#8221; in October the same year, Gnzo revealed products based on &#8220;fabric video&#8221; which is the core technology of Gnzo.</p>\n\n<p>Using the &#8220;fabric video&#8221; technology, although many videos are playing simultaneously, it is in fact using just one single bitstream. By combining multiple bitstreams of videos into one bitstream server-side, it becomes possible to simultaneously play multiple numbers of videos within a much narrower bandwidth. The adoption of H.264/AVC international standard also makes it possible to experience this new visual expression and viewing style on many devices. The user can play many videos at once on a single screen without relying on the device. In addition, it allows users to interact with video by zooming in and out freely and through video wall context navigation. </p>\n\n<p>The company changed its name to Gnzo Inc. in January 2012, and released its first iPhone app &#8220;Gnzo&#8221; in February the same year.</p>\n\n<p>The main feature of iPhone app &#8220;Gnzo&#8221; lies in the use of the core technology of fabric video which allows lining up many videos and playing them on the same screen at once. Users can easily upload Six-Second Videos shot with iPhone and share them with others. Other functions especially added for this application include Clipping videos that catch one&#8217;s interest and viewing them simultaneously on a single screen, assemble videos by keywords, tags, or by user name and viewing them simultaneously on a single screen, and submitting the uploaded videos to Twitter or Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>With the launch of the consumer-oriented iPhone application &#8220;Gnzo&#8221; as a starting point, Gnzo Inc. is also planning to develop business-oriented platforms and services within the year 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0010/3131/103131v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0010/3131/103131v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,128],"assets/images/resized/0010/3131/103131v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Toshikazu","last_name":"Shinohara","permalink":"toshikazu-shinohara","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.15M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Yokohama-city","state_code":null,"country_code":"JPN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"236.25\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/guIKQKTGgBs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Gnzo_Vision</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"236.25\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eZQUSuZnjMo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Gnzo - Official launch video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0021/3964/213964v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0021/3964/213964v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,162],"assets/images/resized/0021/3964/213964v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0021/3965/213965v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0021/3965/213965v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0021/3965/213965v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/fabric-video-want-to-change-the-way-you-search-for-videos/","title":"Fabric Video Wants To Change The Way You Search For Videos"},{"external_url":"http://videos.tf1.fr/infos/plein-ecran/lci-plein-ecran-du-4-decembre-2010-6176132.html","title":"http://videos.tf1.fr/infos/plein-ecran/lci-plein-ecran-du-4-decembre-2010-6176132.html"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/28/gnzo/","title":"Gnzo Is Instagram For Video And A Flashy Multi-Video Viewer In One"}]}
