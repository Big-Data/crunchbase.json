Together with an experienced and driven team of people she managed to start a new organic food manufacturer specialized in the development and production of fresh and healthy organic food and drink products for babies, young children and (senior) adults. </p>\n\n<p>We innovate by developing new technology and processes to create the best tasting healthy food products, which can enable millions of people to grow and stay healthy. Besides the successful development of the most sustainable cooking process, we managed to develop new processing and packaging technologies together with our selected partners, which results in better quality fresh (chilled) produce with a longer shelf life and more convenience for the consumer.</p>\n\n<p>Our international consumer brands will be launched in Europe late 2012 and our products will be sold via all At-Home, Out-of-Home and online channels.</p>\n\n<p>www.offg.eu</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0020/4461/204461v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0020/4461/204461v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,152],"assets/images/resized/0020/4461/204461v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marie-Anne","last_name":"Zomer","permalink":"marie-anne-zomer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Patrick W.","last_name":"Driessen","permalink":"patrick-driessen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/4460/204460v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/4460/204460v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/4460/204460v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Patrick Driessen</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Wolter","last_name":"Snijder","permalink":"wolter-snijder","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Zwolle","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.offg.eu","title":"OFFG website"}]}
