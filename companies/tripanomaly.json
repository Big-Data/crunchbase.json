When we first set out to start TripAnomaly we had one thought in mind, to revolutionize the way people travel by helping them make better decisions on which airlines to fly with. Now, we’ve made it easy for you not only to fly with the best airline but to quickly start earning air miles within minutes of registering on TripAnomaly.</p>\n\n<p>We also offer an advanced flight reliability and standardized ranking system. It looks at factors such as how often a flight is delayed, the severity of the delay, how often the flight has been canceled, diverted, and more. It then compares that score to both flights operating the same city pair route as well as all flights operating across the country. The final score is in relation to all other flights. A TripAnomaly score of “10″ means that this flight has earned our trust. A flight with a score of “1″ should be avoided whenever possible.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Wilkinson","last_name":"Egwu","permalink":"wilkinson-egwu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Xiao","last_name":"Wen Lin","permalink":"xiao-wen-lin","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Expedia.com","permalink":"expedia-com","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Orbitz.com","permalink":"orbitz-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
