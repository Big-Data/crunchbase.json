Job Board Reviews was born out of necessity.</p>\n\n<p>Searching for a job is a very stressful endeavor. There are so many job boards out there â€“ how do you know where to start and where NOT to waste your time. The creators of JBRâ€™s were tired of searching through so many job sites seeing the same exact jobs and paying to surface candidates from job boards that were simply â€œstealingâ€ from other job sites. JBR is designed to help both job seekers and employers find the best possible job boards for their needs in every industry and position. We try to help solve the problem so many job seekers have of applying to jobs and never hearing a response and avoid employers wasting A LOT of time and money posting open positions that are never seen and never filled.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0007/4672/74672v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/4672/74672v6-max-250x250.png"],[[355,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/4672/74672v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
