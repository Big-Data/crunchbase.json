We provide millions of women the ability to rent designer dresses, accessories and other essentials for a fraction of the retail price, allowing them to look, and more importantly, feel, beautiful for all of their special occasions. A goal of the company is to make rental a significant part of the retail industry – our belief is that retail does not just have to be in the business of selling products but rather using products to deliver aspirational experiences. We will be expanding into new categories and countries in the short-term. Our platform is a much needed customer acquisition channel for the brand partners we work with, providing them access to a younger customer and important data. </p>\n\n<p>Launched in November 2009, Rent the Runway has grown to be the leader in the global fashion rental space and is known as a “Netflix for Fashion.” We are backed by some of the top venture capitalists in the world including Kleiner Perkins, Highland Capital and Bain Capital Ventures. We&#8217;ve been recognized by The Today Show, Fortune, Fast Company, The New York Times, and Tech Crunch as one of the most innovative businesses in the U.S. Our team is filled with passionate go-getters who are always dreaming big, implementing their ideas, delivering an incredible experience to our customers and creating a fun, dynamic culture.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/8288/78288v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0007/8288/78288v1-max-250x250.png"],[[314,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/8288/78288v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder
