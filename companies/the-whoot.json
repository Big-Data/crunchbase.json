The Whoot provides its users with the answer to the question “What is everyone doing tonight?” </p>\n\n<p>On The Whoot users create posts which detail what they are doing (or what they would like to do) that night. Each post fits into one of four categories; Working, Staying in, Relaxing Out or Partying. Throughout the day users are able to consult a large feed containing the posts of the friends that they follow.</p>\n\n<p>The Whoot allows users to &#8220;Loop In&#8221; with friends, essentially indicating to those friends that the user desires to be kept &#8220;In-the Loop&#8221; in regards to what that friend ends up doing later on that night. </p>\n\n<p>The Whoot has mobile applications for the iPhone and Android platforms and is also available online.</p>\n\n<p>The Whoot was founded by Ryan Coyne, Marc MacLeod and  William Quartner in January of 2012 (launched publicly in February 2012). </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1780/171780v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1780/171780v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1780/171780v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"MacLeod","permalink":"marc-macleod","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Coyne","permalink":"ryan-coyne-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/2575/172575v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/2575/172575v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[214,370],"assets/images/resized/0017/2575/172575v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Will","last_name":"Quartner","permalink":"will-quartner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"McCormick","permalink":"matt-mccormick","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"20 Valley Stream Parkway","address2":"","zip_code":"19355","city":"Malvern","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M2pSx9sBT94\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/36704931?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36704931\">What is The Whoot?</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user10421814\">The Whoot</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>What is The Whoot?</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Nrr46p3Dvxo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Interview with Co-Founder Ryan Coyne</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1776/171776v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1776/171776v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1776/171776v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[79,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1777/171777v2-max-150x150.png"],[[133,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1777/171777v2-max-250x250.png"],[[239,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1777/171777v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1778/171778v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1778/171778v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1778/171778v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0017/1779/171779v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0017/1779/171779v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0017/1779/171779v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
