And in the meantime, to entertain the masses on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>All site members (the &#8216;Kwipsters&#8217;) start out at the bottom, as unproven talents. As they begin posting kwips, they start ascending the Kwipster leaderboard and earning badges along the way, depending on how funny their kwips are rated.\nEvery Kwipster starts at Level 0 (Class Clown) and has the chance of rising to the top to Level 20 (Late Night Legend)&#8230;or dropping through the floor to Level -1 (Comic Sans).</p>\n\n<p>Kwipster is not just for funny people; it&#8217;s also for the &#8216;less&#8217; funny people who like them. People who enjoy hearing jokes on all the latest news and the types of humor they see on their favorite late night talk shows. Kwipster provides them with a new, real-time outlet to make them laugh at any time of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Kwipster is operated by a team of veteran web and entertainment professionals Los Angeles, California. </p>\n\n<p>Visit the website: \nhttp://www.kwipster.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0012/5355/125355v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0012/5355/125355v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[369,117],"assets/images/resized/0012/5355/125355v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Contact Address","address1":"P.O.
