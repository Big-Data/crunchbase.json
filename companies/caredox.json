Its first product was MotherKnows, a subscription-based service that is fast, simple and easy to use.

Parents can view complete medical history via the web or mobile and share this information easily with any medical provider or caregiver.</p>\n\n<p>CareDox&#8217;s next product is a brand new health information management tool for schools, camps and day cares that replaces the need for parents to fill out paper health forms. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Hesky","last_name":"Kutscher","permalink":"hesky-kutscher","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6617/146617v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6617/146617v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6617/146617v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Sorensen","permalink":"paul-sorensen","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Goff","permalink":"greg-goff","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"Guerrero","permalink":"francisco-guerrero","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/2991/212991v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[176,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/2991/212991v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,312],"assets/images/resized/0021/2991/212991v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.shopinterest.co/about\" title=\"ShopInterest\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShopInterest</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Mohammad","last_name":"Shahangian","permalink":"mohammad-shahangian","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6619/146619v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6619/146619v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6619/146619v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.6M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":1000,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"299 S California Ave","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"94306","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
