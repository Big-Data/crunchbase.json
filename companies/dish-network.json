The corporate office is based in the Meridian Complex located in Englewood, Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>DISH Network, a publicly traded Fortune 200 company, is the media and entertainment arm of its former parent company, EchoStar Communications Corporation, founded in 1980 by Charlie Ergen, Candy Ergen and Jim DeFranco.</p>\n\n<p>The two companies officially split in 2008 - EchoStar becoming the source for the technology DISH Network uses to offer TV services - and Charlie Ergen remained at the helm of both entities.</p>\n\n<p>DISH Network is known as the value leader among all television providers. The company has a reputation for keeping costs low internally in order to pass savings on to subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>An enterprise-wide motto is to &#8220;spend money like it&#8217;s your own.&#8221; Following that mantra, DISH Network chooses to make careful investments. The company is notorious for negotiating fair contracts with programmers to ensure the best quality programming for customers at the greatest value. Additionally, DISH Network focuses on improving customer service, an investment that has paid off as DISH Network is first in Customer Satisfaction among all cable and satellite providers according to the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey results for the country&#8217;s largest cable and satellite TV providers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/0076/120076v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[98,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/0076/120076v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[98,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/0076/120076v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Charlie","last_name":"Ergen","permalink":"charlie-ergen","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":228000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/06/dish-wins-bankruptcy-auction-buys-blockbuster-assets-for-228m-in-cash/","source_description":"DISH Wins Bankruptcy Auction, Buys Blockbuster Assets For $228M In Cash","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":6,"company":{"name":"Blockbuster","permalink":"blockbuster-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0005/6515/56515v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,153],"assets/images/resized/0005/6515/56515v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,245],"assets/images/resized/0005/6515/56515v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Dish Network Buys Bankupt Satellite Company DBSD ","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-dish-network-buys-bankupt-satellite-company-dbsd/","source_text":"","source_description":"Dish Network Buys Bankupt Satellite Company DBSD ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Dish Network","permalink":"dish-network"}},{"description":"DISH Network Corporation (DISH) has announced that it was chosen as the winning bidder for largely all of the assets of Blockbuster, Inc (BLOAQ) in the bankruptcy court auction.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":6,"source_url":"http://www.theamericandishtv.com/blog/dish-network-acquires-blockbuster-inc/","source_text":null,"source_description":"DISH Network to Acquire Blockbuster Inc.
