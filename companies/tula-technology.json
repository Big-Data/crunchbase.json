This significant improvement in fuel efficiency is achieved through two mechanisms: by operating each cylinder primarily at its optimal efficiency point, and by firing only as many cylinders as needed to provide the driverâ€™s requested level of power and torque. Tula is able to implement a solution that would not have been possible prior to the combination of digital technology and Tula&#8217;s algorithmic breakthrough.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0013/9987/139987v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0013/9987/139987v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[271,96],"assets/images/resized/0013/9987/139987v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Chairman & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Adya","last_name":"S.
