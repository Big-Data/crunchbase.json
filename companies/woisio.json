That is a pretty bumpy ride with many stops-and-gos and we usually get lost in that jungle. The beasts in this jungle are Youtube, Tumblr, soundcloud and the like. At the other end of the spectrum, there is the old media experience defined by TV, radio and magazines/newspapers where the content comes to you through a tightly managed ecosystem where the end user have no direct say. </p>\n\n<p>We, at woisio, think, there is a significant market that is between these 2 media consumption experience. And the answer to this challenge is not in a cool technology but rather, in the human essence that is defined by 4 keywords: Simple, Fair, Fun and Social. </p>\n\n<p>For viewers, woisio is simply the TV, radio and the magazines glued together where people collectively pick what is on and what is not. Our mission is to build a user experience (rather than a product, i.e. video/blog/audio platform) that is based on the 4 fundamental attributes above. </p>\n\n<p>For more details, please go to: \nhttp://woisio.com\nhttp://woisio.com/watching/us#!/content/50970180e4b09f16889b7585  (Woisio video - aired on Woisio US Stage on Nov 6th, 1:45pm)</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/9361/209361v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/9361/209361v2-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/9361/209361v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"woisio","permalink":"woisio","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mujdat","last_name":"Ayoguz","permalink":"mujdat-ayoguz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Murat","last_name":"Zeren","permalink":"murat-zeren","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$800k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Hamit","last_name":"Hamutcu","permalink":"hamit-hamutcu","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Orkun","last_name":"Oguz","permalink":"orkun-oguz","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"R&D Center","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Istanbul","state_code":null,"country_code":"TUR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launched public beta in the US","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"http://www.cnbc.com/id/49788698","source_text":null,"source_description":"Woisio Rolls Out Public Beta Launch with Nationwide Talent Contest: I-GotTalent, I-Say & I-MakeFilms ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Woisio","permalink":"woisio"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/50561693?badge=0\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":"<p>How woisio works - Tim and Jenna explains </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0022/1247/221247v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,143],"assets/images/resized/0022/1247/221247v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,257],"assets/images/resized/0022/1247/221247v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0022/1249/221249v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0022/1249/221249v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,257],"assets/images/resized/0022/1249/221249v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0022/1250/221250v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,143],"assets/images/resized/0022/1250/221250v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,258],"assets/images/resized/0022/1250/221250v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0022/1251/221251v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0022/1251/221251v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,256],"assets/images/resized/0022/1251/221251v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0022/1252/221252v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0022/1252/221252v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0022/1252/221252v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0022/1253/221253v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0022/1253/221253v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0022/1253/221253v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://gigaom.com/video/woisio-closed-beta/","title":"GigaOm Article on Woisio"},{"external_url":"http://www.cnbc.com/id/49639412","title":"Woisio rolls out Public Beta with a Nationwide Talent contest"},{"external_url":"http://woisio.com/watching/us#!/content/50970180e4b09f16889b7585","title":"Woisio - What it is about"}]}
