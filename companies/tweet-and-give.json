Every page on the site displays small banner ads that are paid for by corporate sponsors. TweetAndGive donates a minimum of 80% of the siteâ€™s gross ad revenue to a select group of charities, including the Humane Society, Doctors Without Borders, and the Innocence Project. Users choose which among the selected charities to support, and support is as simple as logging in and Tweeting to drive ad revenue.</p>\n\n<p>TweetAndGive users are encouraged to invite others to use the app. All of a userâ€™s Twitter followers who use the app are automatically part of the userâ€™s Giving Group, with the Groupâ€™s total donations displayed to the user. A â€œTop 10 Giving Groupsâ€ leader board challenges users to build their Giving Groups and watch their donation totals rise. Displaying Giving Group donation totals gives the user a glimpse into how TweetAndGive harnesses the power of a large social network and channels its activity into creating a positive impact on the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0012/0864/120864v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/0864/120864v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,96],"assets/images/resized/0012/0864/120864v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Leisawitz","permalink":"scott-leisawitz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://tweetandgive.org/press/tweetandgive-pressrelease-02-01-2011.pdf","title":"Press Release 2011-01-01"}]}
