Vaultive is currently recruiting top sales engineers, software engineers, web developers, and QA engineers. </p>\n\n<p>Vaultive&#8217;s cloud data encryption solutions empower organizations to realize the cost savings, enhanced productivity and operational efficiencies of cloud computing while maintaining the data security, control and compliance advantages of on-premise computing. Vaultive enables this through the deployment of patent-pending data-in-use encryption technology that eliminates the data security, privacy, residency and regulatory compliance concerns associated with cloud deployment. The companyâ€™s core technology enables encrypted data to be searched, indexed, sorted and otherwise processed within a cloud application without first having to be decrypted. Vaultive also enables a customer to encrypt data-at-rest within the cloud environment while enterprise IT retains control of the encryption keys. This breakthrough patent-pending technology can be applied to a broad spectrum of cloud applications without compromising functionality, performance, or changing the end-user experience.</p>\n\n<p>Specialties: Cloud Security, Cloud Data Encryption, Cloud Data Protection, Cloud Data Protection for Hosted Exchange
