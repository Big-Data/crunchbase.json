This platform will enable the development of three or more products that address various market needs in the overall market for lung disorders.</p>\n\n<p>A deficiency of Surfactant Protein D (SP-D) within the lungs is a major contributor to certain lung disorders. SP-D, a naturally occurring protein, is known to provide a key role in proper lung function and in protection against pulmonary infection and inflammation. The initial products for development are based on recombinant human surfactant protein D (rhSP-D), and include two products for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and one product for the treatment of pulmonary infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ultimately, we believe that rhSP-D can be used to treat other pulmonary infections and inflammation as well.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0013/7809/137809v1-max-150x150.png"],[[240,114],"assets/images/resized/0013/7809/137809v1-max-250x250.png"],[[240,114],"assets/images/resized/0013/7809/137809v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"E.
