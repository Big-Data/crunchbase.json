Drop the Chalk caters to the standards, culture and curriculum of each specific school&#8211;creating a customized student data management system for each customer.</p>\n\n<p>Kickboard, Drop the Chalk&#8217;s first product, allows teachers to make notes about their students throughout the day, noting, for example, discipline problems, difficulty in grasping key concepts, and positive behavior as well. They can also view their colleagues&#8217; observations about the same kids. The software then analyzes the data and searches for patterns that help teachers improve student performance. It also includes a points-based system to help teachers determine which students qualify for rewards, and which ones should, say, get detention. A student/parent portal is currently in development. </p>\n\n<p>Kickboard is currently running in 15 New Orleans charter schools. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0016/4266/164266v2-max-150x150.png"],[[186,119],"assets/images/resized/0016/4266/164266v2-max-250x250.png"],[[186,119],"assets/images/resized/0016/4266/164266v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"Schnidman Medbery","permalink":"jennifer-schnidman-medbery","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Wireless Generation","permalink":"wireless-generation","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0011/2363/112363v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0011/2363/112363v1-max-250x250.png"],[[272,60],"assets/images/resized/0011/2363/112363v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$100k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/207584","source_description":" Drop the Chalk: Changing the Way Teachers Teach","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"First Light Ventures","permalink":"first-light","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0016/6716/166716v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0016/6716/166716v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,207],"assets/images/resized/0016/6716/166716v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/207584","title":" Drop the Chalk: Changing the Way Teachers Teach"},{"external_url":"http://www.inc.com/30under30/2011/profile-jennifer-schnidman-medbery-founder-of-drop-the-chalk.html","title":"Jennifer Schnidman Medbery, Founder of Drop the Chalk"}]}
