We aim to create a solution that not only works within your budget, but that follows new trends and technologies, offering the prefect balance of creativity and functionality.</p>\n\n<p>You can spend a lot of money working with a large corporation employed by a generation that was raised on old standards, design, and development principles and â€œfeel comfortableâ€ because theyâ€™ve been in business longer, or they have a large office, or a lot of fake awardsâ€¦.</p>\n\n<p>You can spend a very small amount of money and get your website built by a company based out of the country or by your nephew whoâ€™s in college and knows how to build you a myspace page. This may make you feel like youâ€™re getting a â€œgreat dealâ€ because itâ€™s so cheap, but you get what you pay forâ€¦.</p>\n\n<p>Our business is far from either of these principles. We were the guys making websites for our family and friends in college and we were also working for â€œthe manâ€ and big corporations, and we realized that neither were of the caliber that we wanted. So we went out to change the web. We are young, and we are bold, but weâ€™re also very good. We could program in our sleep (not joking, we often dream in code.. itâ€™s scary) and we donâ€™t produce work that we donâ€™t like. If you work with us, weâ€™re not going to just be your designers or developers. Weâ€™re going to be your friends that you can call night or day and ask for favors. Weâ€™re the friend that will make suggestions and be honest and forward with you. Weâ€™ll be the friend that you can trust, chat with, and get advice from. So if youâ€™re looking for just a plain website, call the other guys, we donâ€™t mind.. honestly. But if youâ€™re looking for more, call us, and letâ€™s change your business together!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/2854/102854v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/2854/102854v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0010/2854/102854v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Clayton","last_name":"McIlrath","permalink":"clayton-mcilrath","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main US Office","address1":"1609 Parkside Cir","address2":"","zip_code":"80026","city":"Lafayette","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
