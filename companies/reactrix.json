Their technology was created to give consumers more control over their media experience. They launched in 2002 using their gesture-based technology for special events and trade shows.</p>\n\n<p>Today they run the Reactrix STEPscape™ Media Network in more than 186 malls and theatres. Reactrix&#8217; &#8220;A-list&#8221; advertisers span a diverse range of leading brands including Coca-Cola, Sony Pictures, Subway, Mars, Hilton Hotels, AT&amp;T, Xbox, RIM, T-Mobile, Wachovia, Universal Studios, Visa, Paramount Pictures, New Line Cinema and eBay among many others. They recently announced a strategic partnership with National CineMedia, the largest digital in-theatre network, expanding the STEPscape Media Network to AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark USA Inc. (NYSE: CNK) and Regal Entertainment Group (NYSE: RGC), the three largest theatre operators in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>They launched theirr newest media technology, WAVEscape™, at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in a strategic alliance with Samsung. WAVEscape features Wii-like functionality in a digital signage solution. The first WAVEscape Media Network will launch in Hilton Hotels in late 2008. Additional WAVEscape Media Networks will be launching in 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Reactrix&#8217; STEPscape and WAVEscape products feature proprietary, patented interactive display technology and their global patents have priority dates back to 2001.\nReactrix has also created the Reactrix Media Center™ — a digital signage management product that allows outside companies to operate secure out-of-home media networks efficiently and effectively. The Reactrix Media Center is a proven, scalable media and network management platform and offers the same &#8220;unplug and play&#8221; wireless solution that runs the STEPscape Media Network.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently, they launched the Reactrix Spectacular division to develop, create and produce one-of-a-kind, larger-than-life installations for clients featuring their projection and gesture-based technology.</p>\n\n<p>Innovation and engagement are the keys to Reactrix and the foundation of their effective advertising medium. But most importantly, they pride ourselves on a company culture that ensures an innovative and engaging environment for each and every employee.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0022/2129/222129v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0022/2129/222129v1-max-250x250.png"],[[260,52],"assets/images/resized/0022/2129/222129v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
