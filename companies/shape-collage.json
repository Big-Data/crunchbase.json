These collage images can be used in any digital setting, such as on blogs or as desktop wallpapers, or be printed for posters and scrapbook uses.</p>\n\n<p>The Shape Collage desktop software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.</p>\n\n<p>Shape Collage Online is a web application that uses the Shape Collage technology to create collages using photos on the web.  These collages also serve as an image browsing tool because the individual photos in the online collages can be enlarged by clicking on them.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/5746/65746v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/5746/65746v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,256],"assets/images/resized/0006/5746/65746v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Cheung","permalink":"vincent-cheung","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0006/5816/65816v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0006/5816/65816v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[403,402],"assets/images/resized/0006/5816/65816v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Wu","permalink":"mike-wu","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2110/202110v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[184,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2110/202110v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[332,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2110/202110v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Mike Wu</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Ovey","last_name":"Yeung","permalink":"ovey-yeung","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"UX/UI Designer","person":{"first_name":"Jordan","last_name":"Borth","permalink":"jordan-borth","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Software Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Lancaster","permalink":"chris-lancaster","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Picasa","permalink":"picasa","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Collagr","permalink":"collagr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/0103/103v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/0103/103v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0000/0103/103v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wondershare Software","permalink":"wondershare-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/2072/52072v2-max-150x150.png"],[[155,155],"assets/images/resized/0005/2072/52072v2-max-250x250.png"],[[155,155],"assets/images/resized/0005/2072/52072v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Picture2Life","permalink":"picture2life","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/8770/18770v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/8770/18770v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/8770/18770v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"AutoCollage","permalink":"autocollage","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Photovisi","permalink":"photovisi","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Growlab Ventures ","permalink":"growlab-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0013/6711/136711v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,72],"assets/images/resized/0013/6711/136711v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[209,72],"assets/images/resized/0013/6711/136711v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Vancouver","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/iMrSkUzg7ws&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/iMrSkUzg7ws&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Shape Collage Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0006/5745/65745v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0006/5745/65745v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,266],"assets/images/resized/0006/5745/65745v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.macworld.com/article/140306/2009/06/shape_collage.html","title":"Macworld Review"},{"external_url":"http://lifehacker.com/5156027/shape-collage-is-a-seriously-fun-photo-collage-application","title":"Lifehacker Review"},{"external_url":"http://www.labnol.org/software/create-high-resolution-picture-collages-posters/7426/","title":"Digital Inspiration Review"}]}
