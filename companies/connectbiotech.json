CB is comprised of institutional investors, venture capitalists, sell side analysts, investment bankers and company management.   Members can track upcoming events and conferences, while leveraging CBâ€™s platform for business development, due-diligence, and investor relations purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Key features:\nÂ·         Conference Connect\nList of companies attending a conference / event, either to present or attend.   Companies will be automatically added to events as they are announced, but company members can manually add themselves to any conference. CB members will not only be able to see the full list of companies presenting or attending, but will also be able to directly request meetings with company representatives who are members of the site. This feature can assist with business development, investor outreach, and relationship building.</p>\n\n<p>Â·         Track-It\nIf you are interested in a particular company use this feature to help you follow which conferences they will be at. Track-It will send you a real time update when a company is added to a conference. You will then be able to request a meeting with attending company representatives.</p>\n\n<p>Â·         Event Calendar\nThis is a comprehensive list of upcoming events.  CB members also have the ability to make additions, including R&amp;D or Analyst Dayâ€™s, Annual Meetings, and scientific presentations. Members can also link documents to these events, such as a corporate presentation, company factsheet or posters.</p>\n\n<p>Â·         Company Database Search \nSearch our database of companies for general information.  CB currently has information on over 18,000 companies.</p>\n\n<p>Â·         Trip Locator\nMembers can join events, and manually add trips, to discover business opportunities with fellow colleagues traveling to the same conference or city. When you RSVP to a conference, or add your trip to the CB network, the system will inform you of anyone within your network that will be in that particular city. Additionally, under the â€œNew Business Opportunityâ€ tab, you can find others outside your direct network in the same city as you.</p>\n\n<p>Â·         Daily News &amp; Blogs &amp; Twitter\nWe have several providers giving CB unique daily content for the site.  </p>\n\n<p>Â·         Task Control / Personal Notes\nAdd a personal note to virtually any entry within ConnectBiotech. Throughout the site, you will find notepad icons to help keep track of your thoughts, ideas and comments. In Personal Notes, all entries are completely private and only viewable by you. Whether you want to remind yourself to attend an event next year or to contact a new CB connection, your Personal Notes are a great resource to keep all your thoughts in one easy-to-use location.</p>\n\n<p>Â·         Job Listings\nPost your own and search listings from other CB members.  </p>\n\n<p>Â·         Special Member Benefits\nSpecial deals for ConnectBiotech members only, including subscriptions to business services, reduced conference participation costs, reduced hotel rates, and other deals for business executives.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0012/9307/129307v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/9307/129307v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,117],"assets/images/resized/0012/9307/129307v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Fechtner","permalink":"thomas-fechtner","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Biomindshare","permalink":"biomindshare","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"PR & IR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"The Trout Group","permalink":"the-trout-group","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"740 Broadway","address2":"9th Floor","zip_code":"10003","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0012/9305/129305v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0012/9305/129305v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,256],"assets/images/resized/0012/9305/129305v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0012/9306/129306v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,236],"assets/images/resized/0012/9306/129306v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,425],"assets/images/resized/0012/9306/129306v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
