Since founding NewTek in 1985, Tim Jenison has led the way in the design of a series of groundbreaking products, and continues to guide the company in pioneering innovative and affordable tools for computer-generated animation, video, and film special effects.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, NewTek has been a driving force in pushing the edge of video and 3D graphics technology, while redefining price, performance, and ease of use. NewTek is perhaps best known in the film and video industry, as the company that created the desktop video market segment in 1990, with the introduction of its wildly successful product, the Amiga Video ToasterÂ®. In 1993, NewTek, its founder, Tim Jenison, and this revolutionary product were presented with an EmmyÂ® Award for Technical Achievement. In 2003, NewTek was again presented with an Emmy for LightWave 3DÂ®&#8217;s seminal role in the revolution of CGI visual effects, over the preceding decade. NewTek has built its success on the concept of providing powerful, intuitive products at prices that are very affordable. In late 2001, NewTek once again redefined video editing with the release of the powerful Video ToasterÂ® [2], the next-generation Video ToasterÂ®, running on the Windows 2000 platform.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0009/1320/91320v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/1320/91320v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0009/1320/91320v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"5131 Beckwith Blvd.","address2":"","zip_code":"78249","city":"San Antonio","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"NewTek launches TriCaster during DEMO@15","stoned_year":2005,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":13,"source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newtek-announces-portable-live-production-suite-at-demo-show-54052162.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"NewTek Announces Portable Live Production Suite at DEMO Show","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"NewTek","permalink":"newtek"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/goRrgeXRYAI%2Em4v\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"240\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally published <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2010/06/multiple-streaming-of-live-events-made-possible-with-tricaster-single-streaming-is-so-2007.html\" title=\"on Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">on Beet.TV</a></p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/goRrg4PwIwI.x?p=1\" width=\"370\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#goRrg4PwIwI\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2012/10/newtek.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
