Entellus is based in Maple Grove, MN and markets products throughout the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Entellus Medical works closely with leading researchers and clinicians to develop solutions that benefit patients, physicians, and payers. Entellus provides a simple, direct and effective treatment for Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) that is less invasive, reduces pain and bleeding, shortens recovery time, and eliminates the need for general anesthesia.</p>\n\n<p>Entellus recently introduced FinESSâ„¢ Sinus Treatment, a simple and direct approach to effectively treat patients with CRS. FinESS can be performed under local anesthesia, with or without light sedation, and remodels the maxillary ostium and the ethmoid infundibulum using a micro endoscope and a small balloon catheter. Unlike sinus surgery techniques, FinESS does not require the removal of delicate bone or sinus tissue, resulting in shorter treatment time with very little pain or bleeding. Recovery time is usually one to two days with many patients resuming normal activity within a day.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0006/6593/66593v1-max-150x150.png"],[[151,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6593/66593v1-max-250x250.png"],[[151,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6593/66593v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$92M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://news.morningstar.com/newsnet/ViewNews.aspx?article=/BW/20091117005641_univ.xml","source_description":"MorningStar","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Essex
