A task is assigned to a user bei using @mentions. </p>\n\n<p>People that are not already TheDeadline users are invited automatically. </p>\n\n<p>New tasks and any changes are immediately pushed to all co-workers in realtime. </p>\n\n<p>TheDeadline is versioning all task-data to enable the user to trace all changes that were made to a task, including text, state and due-date changes. </p>\n\n<p>To support the user in keeping in overview over a large number of task that are shared with a larger team, TheDeadline provides a Newsfeed with important information about the ongoing state of the users own and delegated tasks. What is &#8220;important&#8221; is analyzed by an integrated rule-based expert system to create non-annoying, meaningful messages. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0014/9657/149657v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0014/9657/149657v2-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0014/9657/149657v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Software Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Robin","last_name":"Brandt","permalink":"robin-brandt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Software Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"Gutsfeld","permalink":"sebastian-gutsfeld","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
