We love our moms and pops, but we also squirm when we see them adjusting to the lives of digital immigrants. We squirm even more when we see some otherwise awesome companies, both big and small, look like our parents using Facebook. So, we&#8217;re here to help. (Just please don&#8217;t ask us to fix any printers.) Our goal: to provide you with native insights that will help companies thrive in the brave new digital world.</p>\n\n<p>Our largest area of business is our work as a full-service\ndigital agency. We develop concepts, shape them into\nstrategies, and then break them down and execute each\ntactic with professional attention to detail. We&#8217;re both an\nagency resource for full-spectrum advertising firms looking\nfor help in the digital space, and an independent provider of\nstrategy and implementations directly for our clients.</p>\n\n<p>Not every business is looking for a huge campaign or\nmobile development, and we know that. For the small\nbusiness owner who is great at what she does, but doesn&#8217;t\nhave time to master the tools of social media, we are here to\nhelp. Our popular Digital Immigration program is designed\nto empower small and medium size businesses to make the\nmost out of the social web. With our friendly and\nstraightforward consulting, any small business can be a social\nsuperstar.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/8572/158572v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/8572/158572v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/8572/158572v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Marketing Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Jacobs","permalink":"jonathan-jacobs","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Guttmann","permalink":"benjamin-guttmann","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Vlad","last_name":"Lackovic","permalink":"vlad-lackovic","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Guttbinder","permalink":"steve-guttbinder","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"53 Old Route 22","address2":"","zip_code":"10504","city":"Armonk","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
