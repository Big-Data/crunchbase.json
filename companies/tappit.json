So, as opposed to providing 75% discount on a Pedicure in Pontypool or a 2-for-1 Massage and Facial in Felixstowe, Tappit provides local information that is directly relevant to the user’s location. It allows retailers, restaurateurs and other merchants / service providers to  provide up-to-the-minute information about what&#8217;s happening where they are. </p>\n\n<p>A Tappit Geofence can be created around any city, town or village - or indeed a single shop or venue.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not just retail, leisure and entertainment - but also local history information, art galleries, museums, amateur sports, cultural events, and special interest clubs, you name it.</p>\n\n<p>Tappit provides local retailers and merchants with a means of advertising with pin-point accuracy and helps them compete locally with national brands for consumer mind-share. If they want to promote a Daily Deal, that’s great too and the good news is – they get the full value, there’s no voucher vulture to pay commission to.</p>\n\n<p>Tappit helps revitalise the high street by providing a dynamic focus and local ‘buzz&#8217; that is about &#8220;my location&#8221; – it creates a sense of belonging to a community.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"MD & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Sloan","permalink":"tom-sloan-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technology Wizard","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Osborne","permalink":"matt-osborne","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£50k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Sloan","permalink":"tom-sloan","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Development ","address1":"Friary Lane","address2":"","zip_code":"PO19 1UF","city":"Chichester","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[90,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2532/202532v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2532/202532v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[270,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2532/202532v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
