We believe that we are the leading provider of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States and that our Green Dot Network is the leading prepaid reload network in the United States. We sell our cards and offer our reload services nationwide at approximately 50,000 retail store locations, which provide consumers convenient access to our products and services. Our technology platform, Green PlaNET, provides essential functionality, including point-of-sale connectivity and interoperability with Visa, MasterCard and other payment or funds transfer networks, and compliance and other capabilities to our Green Dot Network, enabling real-time transactions in a secure environment. The combination of our innovative products, broad retail distribution and proprietary technology creates powerful network effects, which we believe enhance the value we deliver to our customers, retail distributors and other participants in our network.</p>\n\n<p>We were an early pioneer in the development of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, or GPR cards, and associated reload services, which collectively we refer to as prepaid financial services. GPR cards are designed for general spending purposes and can be used anywhere the cardsâ€™ applicable payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, is accepted, but, unlike gift cards, can be reloaded with additional funds for ongoing, long-term use. Our GPR cards are issued as Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards and are accepted worldwide by merchants and other businesses belonging to the applicable payment network, including for bill payments, online shopping, everyday store purchases and ATM withdrawals. We believe that we are the leading provider of GPR cards in the United States based on the 3.4 million active cards in our portfolio as of March 31, 2010, which we define as cards that have had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period.</p>\n\n<p>We have built strong distribution and marketing relationships with many significant retail chains, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, 7-Eleven, Kroger, K-Mart, Meijer and Radio Shack. These retail chains provide consumers with convenient locations to purchase and reload our cards. In addition, any holder of a GPR card issued by a member of our reload network may reload that card at any one of those locations. Currently, there are over 100 third-party prepaid card programs that use our nationwide reload network to facilitate reloading by their cardholders. In 2009, we entered into an agreement with PayPal whereby its customers can add funds to any new or existing PayPal account through our reload network at all retail locations where we sell our products and services, but to date we have not generated significant operating revenues from our relationship with PayPal. In fiscal 2009, the gross dollar volume loaded to our GPR card and reload products was $4.7 billion, an increase of 67% over fiscal 2008.</p>\n\n<p>We have developed a business model with powerful network effects. Growth in the number of our product and service offerings or our network participants, which include consumers, retail distributors and businesses that accept reloads or payments through the Green Dot Network, enhances the value we deliver to all network participants. Our technology platform, Green PlaNET, enables network participants to communicate and complete transactions rapidly and securely through our reload network or third-party payment or funds transfer networks, and is a central component of our network-based business model.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/5301/65301v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[152,152],"assets/images/resized/0006/5301/65301v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[152,152],"assets/images/resized/0006/5301/65301v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder
