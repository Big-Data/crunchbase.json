A message was left on the homepage saying:</p>\n\n<p>Greetings Everyone,</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Tallyzip has lost its technical contributors and has been unable to keep up with the demands of its customers.</p>\n\n<p>In light of those events, Tallyzip will no longer be accepting new registrations and will be ceasing all operations by February 29, 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the company&#8217;s struggles, I personally maintain a strong commitment to Tallyzip&#8217;s vision. So while Tallyzip&#8217;s story has ended, the goal of delivering an easy-to-use, all-in-one, small business solution that connects your day-to-day business functions in a smart and affordable way continues.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize for any inconvenience that this cancellation of services has caused and sincerely thank you for your interest.</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes,\nNathan Pearson</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0015/5706/155706v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0015/5706/155706v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0015/5706/155706v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSRqjZ6_KJs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Tallyzip introduction</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
