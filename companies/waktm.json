Slowly but surely, the rigours of rationality and certainty, were replaced by the illusions &amp; delusions of literature &amp; art, and I fell in love with dreamers &amp; romantics like Ray Bradbury &amp; Anne Rice, leading me to a more positive, more beautiful appreciation of life.\nQuestions as to the nature of consciousness, and the future of Humanity led me (like Asimov and others in the great pantheon of Science Fiction), to write a book based in the future, that wondered how Mankind might progress. My Theology background, and my fascination &amp; indignation as to the horrors of fanaticism &amp; religious fundamentalism, meant that these themes crept into the book as well. The title of the book &amp; main character came (literally) from a dream I had in August 2006. The title was intended both as a description of the characters in the book, whose knowledge gets them into terrible trouble, and also as a description of Mankind, and how knowing, learning and progressing (too much?) leads us inevitably to keep reaching, searching, and growing towards a destiny that none of us can really know, or guarantee. We all know too much&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Rupert Cheek studied music to post graduate level in London majoring in piano and composition. He studied composition for TV &amp; Film at Kingston University and has scored music for a film produced at the London Film Academy.  As a pianist he traveled from London to Berlin and Edinburgh as part of international arts event &#8220;transit station&#8221; where he collaborated with other musicians, dancers and performers.</p>\n\n<p>Elizabeth Weiss-Stenger,  the Virtual World consultant, runs &#8220;Mark-IT Virtual&#8221; (May 2008-, Orlando, Florida), which crosses the borders between Virtual &amp; Physical Life.
