Twelve of these are linked to each other via a navigation bar at the top of each site; apart from &#8220;I Can Has Cheezburger&#8221;, these are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;I Has a Hotdog&#8221;, which follows the same themes as ICHC but predominantly features dogs</li>\n<li>&#8220;ROFLrazzi&#8221;, making fun of celebrities in general and showing pictures of funny things in show business.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Totally Looks Like&#8221;, which matches celebrities and famous people with humorous animals, other people, cartoons, and others.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Pundit Kitchen&#8221;, which pokes fun at news, politics, and politicians.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Up Next in Sports&#8221;, highlighting images of various sports, many of which are taken out of context or featuring innuendo unintended by the photographer and athletes.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Graph Jam&#8221;, a blog for humorous office graphs such as line graphs, Venn diagrams, bar graphs and pie charts.</li>\n<li>&#8220;There I Fixed It&#8221;, showing pictures of kludges.</li>\n<li>&#8220;FAIL Blog&#8221;, containing pictures and videos of blatant stupidity or incompetence with captions involving the terms &#8220;Fail&#8221; and &#8220;Epic Fail&#8221; prominently, and sometimes</li>\n<li>&#8220;Win&#8221; when the word &#8220;fail&#8221; is incorporated with said stupidity. &#8220;Owned&#8221; and</li>\n<li>&#8220;Pwned&#8221; have been used periodically, but the site itself no longer advertises its support of these images, as they are no longer featured prominently.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Failbook&#8221;, featuring failures from social networking sites, mostly Facebook.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Engrish Funny&#8221;, supplying pictures of humorous foreign translation errors known as &#8220;Engrish.&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Learn From My Fail&#8221;, featuring moments of blatant stupidity and incompetence in the form of words as written by the submitter.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Hawtness&#8221;, showing women in bizarre poses and situations.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Art of Trolling&#8221;, showing humorous screenshots from sites such as ChatRoulette and Omegle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Apart from these sites, other sites exist from the makers of &#8220;I Can Has Cheezburger&#8221;, which can be found at http://cheezburger.com/sites. As of June, 2010, the Cheezburger Network has 53 sites; launching new sites is a regular project although about 20% of new sites end in failure. One famous example is a Cheezburger site named &#8220;Tofulator&#8221;, which was a site in which videos are captioned, has not been updated since September 2009. No submissions have been entered as well; this might be because the majority of the videos come from Youtube, and Youtube had launched the feature of captioning a user&#8217;s video as of late 2009. Another example is &#8220;Probably Bad News&#8221;, which depicted funny mistakes in newspapers, but was merged with FAIL Blog.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/8016/118016v3-max-150x150.png"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/8016/118016v3-max-250x250.png"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/8016/118016v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Senoff","permalink":"robert-m-senoff","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder, icanhascheezburger.com","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Nakagawa","permalink":"eric-nakagawa","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/8733/188733v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/8733/188733v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/8733/188733v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Revenue Officer","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Sawicki","permalink":"todd-sawicki","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$32M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://mashable.com/2011/01/18/cheezburger-funding/","source_description":"","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Foundry Group","permalink":"foundry-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[164,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[164,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Madrona Venture Group","permalink":"madrona-venture-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0013/1150/131150v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,102],"assets/images/resized/0013/1150/131150v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,102],"assets/images/resized/0013/1150/131150v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Avalon Ventures","permalink":"avalon-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/2500/22500v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2500/22500v1-max-250x250.png"],[[280,72],"assets/images/resized/0002/2500/22500v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SoftBank Capital","permalink":"softbank-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3955/3955v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/3955/3955v3-max-250x250.png"],[[358,86],"assets/images/resized/0000/3955/3955v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.privco.com/private-company/cheezburger-network","source_description":"PrivCo.com - Private Company Financial Data Authority","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Various","last_name":"Private Investors","permalink":"various-private-investors","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Clear Fir Partners","permalink":"clear-fir-partners","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
