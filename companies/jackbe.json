At the demand of its customers, JackBe centered its product offering around an enterprise mashup server that supports the user-driven ad-hoc integration of data. </p>\n\n<p>Other Ajax/RIA frameworks, portals, SOAs and other enterprise applications can consume mashups built and managed with JackBe&#8217;s mashup software.  JackBe users can create many types of mashups which can be shared with co-workers through spreadsheets, portals, and mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>Companies with competing products include IBM and mashup tools provided by online service providers such as Google and Yahoo.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/1429/1429v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,97],"assets/images/resized/0000/1429/1429v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[201,97],"assets/images/resized/0000/1429/1429v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Presto","permalink":"presto","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO
