Many of these videos have\r\nhad over 25 millions views. However, until today there has been no easy way for a\r\nperson viewing a music video to simply click on the video and purchase the song or a\r\nringtone from the video. Soundflavor and Veeple have created a simple way for\r\nmusicians to place interactive actions into their music videos and directly link to a\r\npurchase. Further, the in-stream interactions, what Veeple calls VeeSpots, also allow\r\nviewers to click to a musicianâ€™s web site, iTunes, eBay, MySpace or Facebook.\r\nâ€œThe people at Soundflavor are excited to have this cool, new functionality for our\r\ncommunity, said Steve Skrzyniarz, Soundflavorâ€™s CEO and Founder. Steve continued,\r\nâ€œThis will let people click directly from a video to our site where they can purchase the\r\nsong or a ringtone, or find music playlists that match user preferences.â€\r\nâ€œWe hope this new capability will help bring together the community of musicians and\r\ntheir listeners in such a way that many more people will purchase the music they listen to\r\non-line. To be able to go from a music video to music purchase is really cool,â€ said Scott\r\nBroomfield, Veepleâ€™s CEO and Co-Founder.\r\nAbout Soundflavor\r\nSoundflavor, Inc. is a digital music company providing industry-leading music search and\r\ndiscovery products to both music professionals and consumers.
