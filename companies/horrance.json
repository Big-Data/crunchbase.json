It interfaces with current popular social media sites and offers scope for users to socially interact at each and every stage.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a site where you can purchase a real insurance policy to safeguard a â€˜Twilightâ€™ obsessed friend against attack from Vampires, or insure your sci-fi geek-sister from Alien Invasion. But the upfront sales and creative policies are just the beginning. Please allow us to explain.</p>\n\n<p>Horrance.com taps into the continually escalating popularity of virtual gifting that is currently sweeping across social media platforms. An insurance policy is purchased and then a humorous update is posted on the receiverâ€™s social media stream, inviting friends to the site by clicking the â€˜I want it too!â€™ link.</p>\n\n<p>We know from research that our core demographic likes to get socially involved. Horrance.com invites just that. â€˜I Have an Ideaâ€™ allows creative users to write their own policies and enter them into an online vote, where other community members viciously and deliciously debate, deciding on the best â€“ with a chance to have them published by Horrance.com.  The built-in blog encourages further discussion and interaction, so we are able to draw in customers and give them the opportunity to become part of a community.</p>\n\n<p>The young social media user is constantly hunting for new and accessible ways to interact and impress their friends without straying too far from the comfort zone of their smart phone or laptop. Research shows that once key â€˜influencersâ€™ within social groups become involved, the rest of the demographic will follow.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside this, the horror-lite genre is very much in vogue, based on current literature and cinematic trends. Horrance.com plays on this, with an edgy aesthetic a large dollop of humour and the fear of the irrational.</p>\n\n<p>Horrance.com offers something wholly unique while operating on social media platforms that are already established and heavily utilised by our core demographic. However, we do not see the potential as restrictive. The policies are also available in paper form and on attractive t-shirts, further expanding the customer base into the 25 and over bracket.</p>\n\n<p>Also, with the â€˜wildfireâ€™ spread of social trends promoted by groups on sites such as Facebook, it means that advertising expenditure doesnâ€™t need to break the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Horns &amp; Hooves Insurance â€“ Real insurance against incredible risks!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2702/152702v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[227,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/2702/152702v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[236,259],"assets/images/resized/0015/2702/152702v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Smorodnikova","permalink":"jane-smorodnikova","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0313/100313v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/0313/100313v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,262],"assets/images/resized/0010/0313/100313v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$30k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://gurnardperch.com","source_description":"Gurnard Perch Sophisticated Technologies","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[127,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2701/152701v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[211,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/2701/152701v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[381,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/2701/152701v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
