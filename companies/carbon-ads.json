These Circles are made up from hand-picked publishers; companies, websites, apps, and creative professionals within the same niche, selected for their quality content and engaged audiences. Publishers are brought together in order to build readerships with specific interests so that Carbonâ€™s ads can be targeted with relevance. </p>\n\n<p>The network is the latest venture from branded business development company Fuel Brand Inc. and its founders Joshua Smibert and Adelle Charles.
