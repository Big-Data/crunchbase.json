An entity could be a web site, a cookbook, a hotel room, a celebrity, a restaurant, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Hunch creates a taste profile by asking them a series of questions which range from serious to profound and subsequently can make recommendations personalized to that user, which live in &#8220;topics&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Topics vary widely, from entertaining subjects like &#8216;Which superhero would you be&#8217; to more conventional questions like &#8216;Should I Switch to A Mac?&#8217;  The system then uses the answers to these questions to offer the user a suggested solution, a &#8220;hunch&#8221; of what the user would
