The goal is to help people find the best (and avoid the worst) places to live or travel to. </p>\n\n<p>AreaVibes offers demographic data and scores for more than 20,000 cities and neighborhoods. After entering your desired location on areavibes.com, the overall score will be calculated out of 100 using an algorithm that takes into account the following categories: cost of living, crime, education, employment, health, housing, local businesses, transportation, weather and user reviews. Additional demographic data and statistics are also available for each category. </p>\n\n<p>Through detailed demographic data, user reviews and a unique scoring system, AreaVibes provides useful information for homebuyers, travelers or people looking to conduct a quality check on their own area. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0014/2570/142570v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,57],"assets/images/resized/0014/2570/142570v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[217,57],"assets/images/resized/0014/2570/142570v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Russo","permalink":"jon-russo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[49,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/2817/142817v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[49,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/2817/142817v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[49,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/2817/142817v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"CityData","permalink":"citydata","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"StreetAdvisor","permalink":"streetadvisor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/1649/21649v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/1649/21649v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,118],"assets/images/resized/0002/1649/21649v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0014/2569/142569v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0014/2569/142569v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0014/2569/142569v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
