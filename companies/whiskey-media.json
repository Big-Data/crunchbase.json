To date, they have built sites about video games, <a href=\"/product/comicvine\" title=\"comic books\" rel=\"nofollow\">comic books</a>, <a href=\"/product/animevice\" title=\"anime\" rel=\"nofollow\">anime</a> and politics. The company builds sites that are &#8220;Whiskey Powered&#8221;, which refers to the proprietary publishing layer they have built on top of the python-based <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\" title=\"Django\" rel=\"nofollow\">Django</a> framework. Their sites borrow heavily from features in <a href=\"/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"/product/wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> to create their community-driven content data. In April 2010, Whiskey added a new feature to their platform called &#8220;Quests&#8221; the turns content creation into a social game with rewards.</p>\n\n<p>Whiskey Media was founded in part by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cnetnetworks\" title=\"CNet Networks\">CNet Networks</a> Co-founder <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/shelby-bonnie\" title=\"Shelby Bonnie\">Shelby Bonnie</a>.

It may revive the site at a later
