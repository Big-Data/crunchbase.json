The Cassandra NoSQL database is at the core of the Acunu offering, but it is Cassandra extended with Acunu innovations to improve resource utilization, manageability and performance; as well as providing the foundation for real-time analytics. Acunu is a very engaged Cassandra contributor (including a committer on its staff) and donates many of its innovations back to the community. </p>\n\n<p>Acunu was founded in 2009 and is backed by some of Europe’s top VC funds.
