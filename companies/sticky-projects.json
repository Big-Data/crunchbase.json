Whether it&#8217;s a group of friends going to hang out at the local bar or two parents trying to meet at their kid&#8217;s soccer field, PigeonMe uses your smartphone to solve the familiar need of connecting people to places. </p>\n\n<p>PigeonMe takes a 3000 year-old communication practice of using &#8220;Homing Pigeons&#8221; to send messages and modernizes it. It enables people to use their smartphones to meetup with each other by sending electronic &#8220;Pigeons&#8221; to each other. It&#8217;s perfect for routing friends and families to meetup locations all around town. </p>\n\n<p>PigeonMe uses your phone&#8217;s location and mapping technology to keep your friends and families informed about the status of your arrival. It keeps you from getting lost and being late, while letting your friends know you are on your way. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
