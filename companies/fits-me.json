According to Mintel, widespread inconsistencies in sizing between different brands and retailers make online clothes shopping a challenge for six in ten shoppers.</p>\n\n<p>Fits.me has applied advanced robotic science to solve the problem of ‘the wrong size’ for online clothes shoppers.  At the heart of Fits.me’s virtual fitting room is ‘FitBot’, a sophisticated robotic mannequin with artificial muscles able to mimic the shape and size of any body type – almost 100,000 different shapes, in fact.  To populate the database of any given brand or retailer, a FitBot is dressed in each item of clothing, in each size.  Each permutation is then photographed at high speed, in high resolution, while the FitBot runs rapidly through its thousands of different body shapes.</p>\n\n<p>Then, on the brand or retailer’s site, after asking a shopper to enter just a few basic measurements – height, neck, chest, waist, arm length and torso length – Fits.me is able to display the garment pictures that correspond exactly to their body shape.  The customer sees exactly how any garment in the range, in any of the available sizes, will hang on them (or cling to them), and all before making their online purchase.  Want a tighter fit?  See how the next size down looks.  Want a looser fit?  Choose to see the next size up.  Fits.me will recommend a size, and even display warning indicators for your customer, showing where the fit of the chosen garment may be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Fits.me takes all of the guesswork out of whether a particular item fits, or doesn’t fit; in short, consigning the traditional sizing chart – and all of its shortcomings – to history.</p>\n\n<p>Does it work?  Data from online clothing retailers using Fits.me shows an improvement in conversion rates of up to 100% [i.e., doubling], and an 8% reduction in overall return rates.</p>\n\n<p>Fits.me was named by Vogue magazine in its 2012 Online Fashion 100 as one of the top 100 most influential names in digital fashion.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0417/50417v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/0417/50417v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/0417/50417v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Virtual Fitting Room","permalink":"virtual-fitting-room","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Pharos systems india pvt ltd","permalink":"pharos-systems-india-pvt-ltd","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Marketing and PR","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Mercury Global Partners","permalink":"mercury-global-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,31],"assets/images/resized/0009/6679/96679v2-max-150x150.png"],[[120,31],"assets/images/resized/0009/6679/96679v2-max-250x250.png"],[[120,31],"assets/images/resized/0009/6679/96679v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$1.75M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/22/fits-me-raises-1-75-million-lets-you-try-on-clothes-before-you-buy-%E2%80%93-on-the-web/","source_description":"Fits.me Raises $1.75 Million, Lets You Try On Clothes Before You Buy â€“ On The Web","raised_amount":1750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":22,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Estonian Development Fund","permalink":"estonian-development-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0004/8605/48605v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/8605/48605v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/8605/48605v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Fits.me Raises €1.5 mln In New Round Of Funding\r\n","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"http://invest-iq.net/2012/02/fits-me-raises-e1-5-mln-in-new-round-of-funding/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Fits.me Raises €1.5 mln In New Round Of Funding ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Fits.me","permalink":"fits-me"}},{"description":"Fits.me Raises €1.5 mln In New Round Of Funding\r\n","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"http://invest-iq.net/2012/02/fits-me-raises-e1-5-mln-in-new-round-of-funding/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Fits.me Raises €1.5 mln In New Round Of Funding ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Fits.me","permalink":"fits-me"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
