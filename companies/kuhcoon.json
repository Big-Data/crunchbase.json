Our in-house social media community managers take the lead in managing the overall efforts of a business’s social media marketing strategy. This can include writing and/or posting content, monitoring accounts, and reporting/communicating ROI.</p>\n\n<p>We are a Social Media as a Service (SMaS) provider that offers an affordable outsourcing solution to social media management. </p>\n\n<p>Our Easy Four-step Process. </p>\n\n<p>We believe that social media management should be as effortless as possible for our clients, so we created an easy four-step process to getting started with our service. Prospective clients fill out an easy sign up form, link the social media accounts they want to be managed using given API’s, communicate directly with their new dedicated Community Manager, and sit back while we begin transforming their brand into a social media butterfly.</p>\n\n<p>Pricing</p>\n\n<p>Our pricing structure is centered around two aspects: the amount of accounts being managed and the amount of managers needed to manage an account.  Our baseline price is $500 per account managed per month and an additional $500 a month for each additional manager needed to manage an account. </p>\n\n<p>For small and medium sized businesses we recommend one Community Manager, while larger enterprise businesses typically require between two and five managers depending on the size of their social media community. The number of managers needed to manage an account is determined by several factors including the size of the community and depth of social strategy. </p>\n\n<p>Our Professional In-House Marketing Tools</p>\n\n<p>We manage all of our clients from our own proprietary in-house technology. Our platform allows us to connect client accounts to our data-analysis software, management tools, analytical tools, and ad management tools among others.</p>\n\n<p>This platform also allows us to streamline communication between our dedicated Community Managers and our clients. Clients can be confident in knowing that all of our software is custom built to produce a streamlined and effective social media marketing campaign for businesses of all sizes. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0018/5047/185047v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0018/5047/185047v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0018/5047/185047v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Torba","permalink":"andrew-torba","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"HootSuite","permalink":"hootsuite","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sprout Social","permalink":"sprout-social","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0008/7035/87035v9-max-150x150.png"],[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0008/7035/87035v9-max-250x250.png"],[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0008/7035/87035v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Scranton Office","address1":"224 Wyoming Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"18503","city":"Scranton","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/46439831\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p>Intro to Kuhcoon from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/kuhcoon\">Kuhcoon</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Social Media as a Service</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
