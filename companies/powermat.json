Powermat allows users to enable their electronic devices once with a Powermat receiver and then set down up to three devices on the charging mat for safe and effective wireless charging. Itâ€™s simple, effortless, and provides consumers with first-of-its-kind freedom from the need to constantly plug/unplug as well as the angst of running on empty. Moreover, Powermat eliminates the tangle of wires that result from multiple cords overload; virtually eliminating â€˜cord fatigueâ€™ among consumers toting more and more â€œmust haveâ€ gadgets.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0011/7621/117621v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0011/7621/117621v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[262,82],"assets/images/resized/0011/7621/117621v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"GM And Powermat Find Love In Vegas, Announces A $5 Million Deal That Puts Powermats In Cars","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/05/gm-and-powermat-find-love-in-vegas-announces-a-5-million-deal-that-puts-powermats-in-cars/","source_text":"","source_description":"GM And Powermat Find Love In Vegas, Announces A $5 Million Deal That Puts Powermats In Cars","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Powermat","permalink":"powermat"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0011/7622/117622v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0011/7622/117622v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,355],"assets/images/resized/0011/7622/117622v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
