The technology enables users to store and share encrypted files with whom you like, with no exposure to complexity. </p>\n\n<p>Ensafer is end-to-end encryption technology. That simply means that a file is never unencrypted, under transport, storage or sharing. All encryption and decryption happens on the client-side, e.g. When a user access a file it is downloaded and decrypted locally, when a user saves a file it is encrypted locally before its sent to the cloud. When a user shares a file, that file is decrypted locally on the recipient’s device.  </p>\n\n<p>Ensafer can easily be used across companies, disciplines and industries with the need to protect information in the Cloud. </p>\n\n<p>The technology integrates with all major hosting and sharing services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, etc. In addition we run this service on AWS as our own encrypted storage/sharing offering.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0021/6809/216809v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0021/6809/216809v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,138],"assets/images/resized/0021/6809/216809v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Terje","last_name":"Wold","permalink":"terje-wold","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"Anders","last_name":"Andersen","permalink":"anders-andersen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Trond","last_name":"Andersen","permalink":"trond-andersen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales & Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Dag","last_name":"Tore Aam","permalink":"dag-tore-aam","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Developer","person":{"first_name":"Øyvind","last_name":"Pedersen","permalink":"yvind-pedersen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Support Manager","person":{"first_name":"Lars-Thore","last_name":"Solberg","permalink":"lars-thore-solberg","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Oslo","address1":"Oslo Science Park","address2":"Gaustadalleen 21","zip_code":"0349","city":"Oslo","state_code":null,"country_code":"NOR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Tromsø","address1":"Grønnegata 86-88","address2":"","zip_code":"9256","city":"Tromsø","state_code":null,"country_code":"NOR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Silicon Valley","address1":"Innovation House","address2":"470 Ramona St","zip_code":"94302","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/51595146\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/51595146\">Ensafer at DEMO Fall 2012</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/ensafer\">Ensafer</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>DEMO Fall 2012</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/50651030\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50651030\">Ensafer • We're integrating (Long)</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/ensafer\">Ensafer</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Ensafer - Encrypting the Cloud</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/5066/215066v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/5066/215066v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/5066/215066v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0021/5067/215067v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0021/5067/215067v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0021/5067/215067v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0021/5068/215068v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0021/5068/215068v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0021/5068/215068v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0021/5069/215069v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0021/5069/215069v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0021/5069/215069v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2012/10/rising-startups-at-demo-fall-2012/?#axzz28FHun7J7","title":"FT.com"},{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/02/ensafer/","title":"Venturebeat"}]}
