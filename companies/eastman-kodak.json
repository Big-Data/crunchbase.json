In so doing, he made a cumbersome and complicated process easy to use and accessible to nearly everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Since that time, the Eastman Kodak Company has led the way with an abundance of new products and processes to make photography simpler, more useful and more enjoyable. In fact, today&#8217;s Kodak is known not only for photography, but also for images used in a variety of leisure, commercial, entertainment and scientific applications. Its reach increasingly involves the use of technology to combine images and information&#8211;creating the potential to profoundly change how people and businesses communicate.</p>\n\n<p>Just as Eastman had a goal to make photography &#8220;as convenient as the pencil,&#8221; Kodak continues to expand the ways images touch people&#8217;s daily lives. The company ranks as a premier multinational corporation, with a brand recognized in virtually every country around the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[82,22],"assets/images/resized/0006/4614/64614v1-max-150x150.png"],[[82,22],"assets/images/resized/0006/4614/64614v1-max-250x250.png"],[[82,22],"assets/images/resized/0006/4614/64614v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"Hayzlett","permalink":"jeffrey-hayzlett","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5126/35126v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5126/35126v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,373],"assets/images/resized/0003/5126/35126v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.dld-conference.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President
