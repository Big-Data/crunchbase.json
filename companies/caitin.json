Natural fluid flowâ€”and the belief that vortical flow holds the key to efficient energy usage. Caitinâ€™s technology was developed by employing a unique set of observations about how nature manages the flow of liquids, gases, and heat. </p>\n\n<p>The company is funded by KV (Khosla Ventures). Founded by venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Khosla Ventures manages a portfolio of cleantech and information technology companies. Caitinâ€™s potential to apply natural design principles to engineer energy efficient products complements Khosla Venturesâ€™ focus on ending U.S. dependence on fossil fuels and reducing CO2 in the environment.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0012/1391/121391v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[211,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/1391/121391v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[211,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/1391/121391v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Fremont","address1":"41900 Christy Street","address2":"","zip_code":" 94538","city":"Fremont","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Petaluma","address1":"1003 Clegg Court, Suite G","address2":"","zip_code":"94954","city":"Petaluma","state_code":"CA","country_code":"CXI","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
