Providing reach into more than 80 percent of U.S. markets through trusted media brands, Wanderful Media helps retailers bring consumers into local stores and gives consumers the most convenient way to discover local merchandise. The company is backed by a powerful group of media companies including Advance Digital, A. H. Belo Corporation, Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., Cox Media Group, The E. W. Scripps Company, Gannett Co., Inc., GateHouse Media, Inc., Hearst Corporation, Lee Enterprises, MediaNews Group, The McClatchy Company and The Washington Post Co. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike price comparison, daily deal and couponing sites, Wanderful Media makes discovery shopping engaging, fun and social for consumers, wherever they are and however they shop – mobile, web or tablet. The company’s Find n Save® product offers local media affiliates a complete discovery shopping solution, designed to connect retail advertisers with millions of consumers. </p>\n\n<p>Wanderful Media represents a media industry initiative to transform the $4 billion business of traditional advertising circulars through digital innovation. Just as joint media ventures such as CareerBuilder and Cars.com strengthened the industry&#8217;s position through the use of new technology, Wanderful Media was created with an even broader set of investors to reinvent the circular advertising business for its partners and extend it to the rest of the industry.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0021/3069/213069v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0021/3069/213069v4-max-250x250.png"],[[278,92],"assets/images/resized/0021/3069/213069v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Find n Save","permalink":"find-n-save","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"T.
