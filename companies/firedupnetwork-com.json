It is a one-stop-shop for professional change. </p>\n\n<p>SEEKING CHANGE</p>\n\n<p>FiredUpNetwork is an all-inclusive resource for people seeking professional change, or Change Seekers, organized around five Resource Sections: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Employment Opportunities</p></li>\n<li><p>Entrepreneurial Pursuits</p></li>\n<li><p>Buy or Sell A Business</p></li>\n<li><p>Fundraising</p></li>\n<li><p>Post-Graduate Education </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As a Change Seeker, your first move will likely be reaching out to people in your network to share your ideas and seek counsel.  In response, they will introduce you to people and recommend books and resources that may be of help to you.  Each of FiredUpNetworkâ€™s Resource Sections mirrors this process via three subsections including: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Resources</li>\n<li>Recommended Reading</li>\n<li>Discussion Boards  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>THE RESOURCES  </p>\n\n<p>The FiredUpNetwork team researched and added 1,500 informational items to the Resource Sections before officially launching.  They are designed in a wiki-like format that allows users to rate, comment and add their own information items to the knowledge base.  As such, the quantity and quality of information will grow and improve as the FiredUpNetwork community expands. </p>\n\n<p>A sampling of the resources includes: headhunting firms organized by industry, business incubation firms organized by state, business brokerage and auction websites, angel networks and venture capital firms that specialize in seed and early stage investments, graduate test preparation courses and much more.</p>\n\n<p>THE NETWORK</p>\n\n<p>FiredUpNetwork is not limited to Change Seekers.  Change Facilitators are an integral part of the network as well. For example, FiredUpNetwork connects </p>\n\n<p>There are three primary ways to develop new contacts on FiredUpNetwork: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Interact with members in the resource sections where you can connect via your common interests;</li>\n<li>Search the entire member database by many different parameters, e.g. location, university affiliation, profession and reasons for which a member joined FiredUpNetwork.  Follow this by introducing yourself with a request to get FiredUp; and</li>\n<li>Tap into your Extended Network to connect with those who are two degrees of separation away from you.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>FiredUpNetwork will be particularly useful to you as you build your career.   It is our goal to constantly improve the site as members comment, rate and add their own resources. Together we can build the most useful resource and professional networking hub on the web.
