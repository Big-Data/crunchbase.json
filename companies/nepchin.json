Instead of you searching for products or services, you let the product/service providers search you!</p>\n\n<p>Have the market come to you!</p>\n\n<p>I like browsing when I have time and enjoy the experience. Window shopping can be quite relaxing and a fun social outing.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I just donâ€™t have time!!!! I need it now! If youâ€™re like me and you need say a computer, how do you know where to go, whoâ€™s offering the best deal? Iâ€™m not an expert so how should I know where to look?! I went from shop to shop, comparing catalogues and had to keep repeating to everyone what I wanted.</p>\n\n<p>It dawned upon me that it would be easier for everyone, if I could just tell them what I needed, how much and when I needed it just once! Not twice but just once!!! Just be able to record somewhere where everyone could all look and record all the offers they made. Then all I had to do was browse each offer and accept the best one!</p>\n\n<p>So with that in mind, I thought up nepchin. A place where I could tell people what I need, they look at what I need and make an offer. I evaluate all the offers and accept the one that suits my needs the best!</p>\n\n<p>Nepchin Pty LTD</p>\n\n<p>ABN 97 139 592 804</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/8623/108623v2-max-150x150.png"],[[110,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/8623/108623v2-max-250x250.png"],[[110,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/8623/108623v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
