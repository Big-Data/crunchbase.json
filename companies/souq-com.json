Today Souq.com attracts over 8 million visits per month and is fast growing as more consumers shop online in the Arab world. </p>\n\n<p>Often tagged as the “Amazon of the Middle East”, Souq.com operates both as a retail site and as a marketplace for third party sellers. It offers a convenient and safe online shopping experience with online payments, option to pay cash on delivery and free returns.</p>\n\n<p>Established in 2005, Souq.com pioneered online shopping in the region as an auction site linked to the Arab internet portal Maktoob. When Yahoo! acquired Maktoob in August 2009, Souq.com was not included in the sale and was spun off as part of Jabbar Internet Group. The site then switched to a marketplace with a fixed price model in early 2011, and then launched its retail division late 2011. </p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Dubai, UAE, Souq.com caters to the needs of local markets with commercial offices in Egypt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and a technical and development center in Jordan.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0009/1455/91455v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0009/1455/91455v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0009/1455/91455v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ronaldo","last_name":"Mouchawar","permalink":"ronaldo-mouchawar","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://arabnet.me/run2sport-madfoo3atcom-secure-investment-oasis500-angel-event/","source_description":"Arabnet -
