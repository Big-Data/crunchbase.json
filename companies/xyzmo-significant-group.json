It makes signing and sealing of electronic documents via a web browser as easy as signing a piece of paper. The system is designed to enhance existing infrastructure with all the necessary functionalities to support a totally paperless process. The integration with the existing infrastructure is very easy and convenient. Documents can be converted into forgery-proof PDF files, displayed in the predefined web interface, and signed using a broad range of signature-capturing devices from various manufacturers, as well as smartcards, tokens, and software certificates. The system is accessed through the application’s “Print” command or via a web service call.<br/>\nhttp://www.xyzmo.com/EN/PRODUCTS/Pages/E-Signature-Capture-Web-Based.aspx </p>\n\n<p>SIGNificant Client</p>\n\n<p>The SIGNificant Client enables signing and sealing electronic documents without the need of being connected to a network. This solution is especially suited for professionals whose working conditions donâ€™t include online connectivity on a regular basis, or for those who wish to work offline such as field agents or small businesses. (Also available as SDK for Windows and Linux)\nhttp://www.xyzmo.com/en/products/Pages/Digital-Signature-Capture-Desktop-Application.aspx</p>\n\n<p>Signature Verification</p>\n\n<p>The SIGNificant Biometric Server allows for the possibility to perform a real-time biometric verification of a personâ€™s signature to the SIGNificant platform by comparing the recorded parameters of his handwritten signatures against his pre-enrolled profile.\nhttp://www.xyzmo.com/en/products/Pages/Signature-Verification.aspx</p>\n\n<p>Signature Capture for iPad and Android </p>\n\n<p>SIGNificant is a device-independent solution, meaning that it enables the use of a broad range of signature-capturing devices from various manufacturers. xyzmo is now extending these possibilities one step further by supporting smartphones and tablets based on Android and Apple iOS technology. This enables customers to use these devices instead of, or in combination with, signature pads, with all the advantages of the xyzmo platform, including the signature comparison.\nhttp://www.xyzmo.com/en/products/Pages/digital-signature-ipad-android.aspx</p>\n\n<p>Our e-signature solutions all contribute to making your office 100% paperless.
