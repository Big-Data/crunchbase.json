It was built according to a template laid out in the 2006 Report of the Energy Research Council commissioned by President Hockfield. The report called for new approaches to multidisciplinary research, education across school and department boundaries, a more energy efficient campus reached in part through student-led projects, and outreach to the policy world through technically grounded analysis. It also emphasized the importance of another MIT strength â€“ partnering with industry as a prime locus for the clean energy transformation needed to address economic, environmental, and security concerns associated with the current energy system.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0021/7497/217497v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[162,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/7497/217497v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[162,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/7497/217497v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$25M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2012/10/22/daily44-MIT-Energy-Initiative-gets-25M-from-BP.html","source_description":"MIT Energy Initiative gets $25M from BP","raised_amount":25000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":26,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"BP","permalink":"bp","image":{"available_sizes":[[[81,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/7499/217499v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[81,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/7499/217499v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[81,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/7499/217499v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"77 Massachusetts Avenue, E19-307","address2":"","zip_code":"02139-4307","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0021/7498/217498v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,203],"assets/images/resized/0021/7498/217498v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,366],"assets/images/resized/0021/7498/217498v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
