Today, sites like these where content is still entered by humans have become archaic in form and function, lack aesthetic compatibility with the latest technology, and are littered with advertising. </p>\n\n<p>In 2009, after being unable to find a site that elegantly publishes news headlines, J.R. Elliott began work on the website that is now the Tea Party Brief. Since then, Tea Party Brief has blossomed into a product that powers tens of thousands of independent thinkers’ news addiction and currently serves almost a million of hits per month. </p>\n\n<p>Because TPB is clearly focused on conservative news and opinion, and the multiple tangents the Tea Party Movement offers, its audience is conveniently focused, yet broad within its borders. Tea Party Brief is popular with bloggers, Pinterest and Facebook users — an increasingly influential demographic — together with:</p>\n\n<p>• early adopters of sites like Drudge Report, Breitbart and Huffington Post;</p>\n\n<p>• almost half of the United States Congress;</p>\n\n<p>• news junkies like ourselves;</p>\n\n<p>• journalists and nationally syndicated talk radio hosts;</p>\n\n<p>• super PACs and political campaigns;</p>\n\n<p>• members of the Independent, Libertarian, Conservative, and Tea Party movements.</p>\n\n<p>A majority of TPB visitors come to its site to find the latest in breaking news and opinion. Its audience is completely devoted to and immersed in what the Tea Party Movement has to offer. They are concerned Americans who are highly engaged, activism minded and thoroughly aware of current events. 97% share and connect with Tea Party Brief via social media. 67% of the Tea Party Brief readers visit the website daily, or multiple times a day, and 30% visit weekly.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/3987/183987v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/3987/183987v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/3987/183987v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"News aggregate","permalink":"news-aggregate","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Creator and Editor","person":{"first_name":"J.R.","last_name":"Elliott","permalink":"j-r-elliott","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Drudge Report","permalink":"drudge-report-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Huffington Post","permalink":"huffingtonpost","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0002/0662/20662v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/0662/20662v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/0662/20662v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Breitbart News Network","permalink":"breitbart-news-network","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,26],"assets/images/resized/0015/5727/155727v1-max-150x150.png"],[[130,26],"assets/images/resized/0015/5727/155727v1-max-250x250.png"],[[130,26],"assets/images/resized/0015/5727/155727v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Ranked in the Top 100 Conservative Websites for 2012","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://backwardtimes.com/2012/04/top-100-conservative-websites-2012/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Backward Times","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Tea Party Brief","permalink":"tea-party-brief"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2012/03/27/obamas-deficit-attention-disorder/","title":"White House Dossier"},{"external_url":"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72371.html","title":"Politico"},{"external_url":"http://youtu.be/1bphAUIBuG8","title":"Glenn Beck"}]}
