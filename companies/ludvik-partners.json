Ludvik + Partners is not an ad hoc group but a committed network of hundreds of experienced and highly talented art directors, creatives and account representatives from across the country. They even got some eager beginners to round out the more experienced hands.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting perhaps, this model creates new ad agencies every day for each clientâ€™s unique needs and opportunitiesâ€”matching their issues to the people best suited to solve them. When the job is done the team is dissolved, ready for new assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Ludvik + Partners does not take on assignments involving tobacco, pharmaceuticals or political campaigns.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0011/0920/110920v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/0920/110920v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0011/0920/110920v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Epirot Ludvik","last_name":"Nekaj","permalink":"epirot-ludvik-nekaj","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/6468/116468v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/6468/116468v4-max-250x250.png"],[[301,301],"assets/images/resized/0011/6468/116468v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"Kemps","permalink":"rose-kemps","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Ludvik + Partners USA HQ","address1":"48W 20th Street","address2":"","zip_code":"10011","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
