Local merchants can turn patrons into Facebook fans in return for giving them free Wi-Fi.</p>\n\n<p>Many local merchants have discovered the value of <em>Facebook fan pages</em> as a marketing tool, just like the major brands. It enables interaction, social recommendations to their fan&#8217;s friends, ease-of-use, and range of rich media. Similarly, merchants are paying &#8220;Daily Deal&#8221; sites lots of money to bring them new\ncustomers &#8211; and want to break the cycle of paying again to bring them back. Signage and in-store promotions have limited effectiveness to get patrons to &#8220;like&#8221; the merchant on Facebook, in order to build a relationship. </p>\n\n<p>With more patrons carrying smartphones, tablets, and laptops, there is greater demand for free Wi-Fi while waiting for service, to check for messages, or to\npass the time. While some can access 3G wireless, they prefer local Wi-Fi because of faster speeds, better coverage, and no data caps. </p>\n\n<p>Wavespot enables the merchants to offer free Wi-Fi, and asks that patrons &#8220;like&#8221; the merchant on Facebook in return. That &#8220;like&#8221; appears on the patron&#8217;s wall as a social recommendation. And the &#8220;like&#8221; creates a new fan for ongoing marketing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0015/2424/152424v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0015/2424/152424v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0015/2424/152424v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Social WIFI Router","permalink":"social-wifi-router","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Siddharth","last_name":"Singh","permalink":"siddharth-singh-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Marketer","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Lamont","permalink":"steven-lamont","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6785/146785v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/6785/146785v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[401,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/6785/146785v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jasbir","last_name":"Singh","permalink":"jasbir-singh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6997/146997v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[221,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/6997/146997v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[237,267],"assets/images/resized/0014/6997/146997v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"181 Fremont Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"198\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mmigKuyqSzk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>WaveSpot</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
