In some cases co-developing with them, in others becoming the developing team. Nearsoft works in long-term engagements.</p>\n\n<p>Clients reach Nearsoft because they are disappointed with offshoring, frustrated because they can&#8217;t find people with the right level of skills, falling behind because they can&#8217;t scale or tired of late releases and poor quality. </p>\n\n<p>Operations are run in Mexico. In this way, the outsourcing development service is provided in local time.</p>\n\n<p>Nearsoft works with the following technologies: Linux, Apache, My SQL, PHP, Java Script and many others.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/2693/22693v2-max-150x150.png"],[[189,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/2693/22693v2-max-250x250.png"],[[189,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/2693/22693v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Martinez","permalink":"roberto-martinez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Perez","permalink":"matt-perez","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Silicon Valley Office","address1":"6580 Via del Oro","address2":"","zip_code":"95119","city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.235298,"longitude":-121.782424}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style=\"width:320px;\"><div style=\"background-color:#dedede;width:320px;text-align:center;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:5px;margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-05-22-tech-mex-an-outsourcing-alternative\" target=\"_blank\">See this video on <span style=\"color:#38538e;font-weight: bold;\">Vator</span><span style=\"color:#50a756;font-weight: bold;\">.tv</span>&nbsp;&raquo;</a></div><embed src=\"http://www.vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=3040_Nearsoft-Int-08-9.flv&b=2&i=3040&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-05-22-tech-mex-an-outsourcing-alternative\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></div>","description":"<p>Vator.tv Interview</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0003/7000/37000v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/7000/37000v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,289],"assets/images/resized/0003/7000/37000v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.siliconstrat.com/blog/2008/07/08/why-nearsoft-promotions-work-well/","title":"Prompt and Persuasive Promotions"},{"external_url":"http://fersht.typepad.com/the_outsourcing_bloghorse/2007/12/nearshoring-sof.html","title":"Nearshoring Software Development to Mexico"},{"external_url":"http://www.redherring.com/blog/MarisaTaylor?bid=22579","title":"Outsourcing in Local Time"},{"external_url":"http://www.globalservicesmedia.com/Content/general200801243645.asp","title":"Top 10 Leaders"}]}
