Their pre-vetted global executive talent bank lets them quickly identify the right candidates much faster than traditional executive headhunters do. </p>\n\n<p>Why Interim Management?</p>\n\n<p>In the past, many companies in Asia have approached Management Consultancies when they wish to gain external (and presumably objective) advice and access to the consultants&#8217; specialized expertise. However, many executives who initially think they need a management consultant ultimately decide to deploy an interim manager. This is because unlike consultants, interim managers are loyal to your business objectives and as they work on a referral basis, they strive to achieve the highest standards. They also have a bigger impact on your business as they take a more hands-on approach rather than just an advisory role.</p>\n\n<p>When would I use an Interim Manager?</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of different situations when the need for an Interim Manager can arise. Interim Management Solutions has placed candidates in a variety of different roles in different situations. Typically these could be situations such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crisis management</li>\n<li>Sudden departure</li>\n<li>Managing change or transition</li>\n<li>Sabbaticals</li>\n<li>MBOs and IPOs</li>\n<li>Mergers and acquisitions</li>\n<li>Project management</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They may also be the interim solution whilst you search for a permanent local Executive Manager in China. All of Interim Management Solutions&#8217; Interim Managers are available on short notice and usually have over 15 years experience in that particular field. Their teams of consultants, specializing in different industries, are dedicated to ensure the Interim Manager is placed in timely fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Why Interim Management Solutions?</p>\n\n<p>With a huge portfolio of Multinational Companies and Fortune 500 clients in numerous different industries, Interim Management Solutions has the experience to successfully place executives in any type of industry.
