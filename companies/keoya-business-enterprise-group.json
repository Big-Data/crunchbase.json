Traditionally, most independent television production companies have been forced to give up these rights to the broadcaster in order to secure distribution. The company will only enter into deals that allow significant control and ownership of all the rights to each project developed, produced, or distributed to the companies library. These rights are valuable, as in addition to the revenues generated from the primary rights licensed to the broadcaster, the company is able to generate substantial additional revenue streams through the use of its own funding source known as Xtreme Revenue Fund, while allowing the Broadcaster to keep their creative integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. We strive to promote an awareness of this newly created prospect within our industry, develop friendly inspired creativeness, and at the same time bring to fruition an economically sustainable businesses, while increasing the Investors value.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to Xtreme Revenue Funding where we take you into the next level of pushing your project into funding.
