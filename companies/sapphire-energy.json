Sapphire’s products and processes in this category differ significantly from other forms of biofuel because they are made solely from photosynthetic microorganisms (algae and cyanobacteria), using sunlight and CO2 as their feedstock; are not dependent on food crops or valuable farmland; do not use potable water; do not result in biodiesel or ethanol; enhance and replace petroleum-based products; are compatible with existing infrastructure; and are low carbon, renewable and scalable. Sapphire has an R&amp;D facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and is currently building the first Integrated Algal BioRefinery in Columbus, New Mexico. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/7089/47089v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0004/7089/47089v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,112],"assets/images/resized/0004/7089/47089v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Pyle","permalink":"jason-pyle","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Cynthia","last_name":"Warner","permalink":"cynthia-warner","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$284M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/29/sapphire-energy-gets-open-checkbook-from-investors-for-algae-based-gasoline/","source_description":"Sapphire Energy gets â€œopen checkbookâ€ from investors for algae-based gasoline","raised_amount":50000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":28,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"ARCH Venture Partners","permalink":"arch-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-150x150.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-250x250.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Venrock","permalink":"venrock","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/6279/16279v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0001/6279/16279v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[351,123],"assets/images/resized/0001/6279/16279v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"d","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":35000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Venrock","permalink":"venrock","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/6279/16279v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0001/6279/16279v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[351,123],"assets/images/resized/0001/6279/16279v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"ARCH Venture Partners","permalink":"arch-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-150x150.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-250x250.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://cleantechbrief.com/node/1147","source_description":"DOE Invests $564M in Advanced Biorefinery Projects","raised_amount":54500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":7,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.sapphireenergy.com/press-article/742445-sapphire-energy-announces-144-million-series","source_description":"SAPPHIRE ENERGY ANNOUNCES $144 MILLION SERIES C FUNDING ","raised_amount":144000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Arrowpoint Partners","permalink":"arrowpoint-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0020/9524/209524v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0020/9524/209524v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,81],"assets/images/resized/0020/9524/209524v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0004/7091/47091v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0004/7091/47091v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,273],"assets/images/resized/0004/7091/47091v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
