Users can upload videos from external video sites and tag them for specific categories. The site relies heavily on user-uploaded aggregation rather than using video indexing technology, which gives it a strong community factor. </p>\n\n<p>Videos can be browsed by categories like &#8220;arts and crafts&#8221;, &#8220;electronics&#8221;, and &#8220;fashion and personal care.&#8221; They can also be browsed by recently added, most viewed, top rated etc. Each video can be commented and rated by the user community. They can also be shared with friends. </p>\n\n<p>SuTree has a search widget for video lessons that can be added to blogs and websites. </p>\n\n<p>Competitors include <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/scouta\" title=\"Scouta\">Scouta</a>, <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/sclipo\" title=\"Sclipo\">Sclipo</a> and <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/5min\" title=\"5Min\">5Min</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0736/736v1-max-150x150.png"],[[157,84],"assets/images/resized/0000/0736/736v1-max-250x250.png"],[[157,84],"assets/images/resized/0000/0736/736v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SuTree","permalink":"sutree","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Maaravi","permalink":"joseph-maaravi","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"Zailer","permalink":"gideon-zailer","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Expert Village","permalink":"expertvillage","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/2533/2533v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/2533/2533v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/2533/2533v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Instructables","permalink":"instructables","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/1058/11058v1-max-150x150.png"],[[234,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/1058/11058v1-max-250x250.png"],[[234,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/1058/11058v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"VideoJug","permalink":"videojug","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0002/1312/21312v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/1312/21312v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/1312/21312v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"5min Media","permalink":"5min","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/0433/433v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/0433/433v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,235],"assets/images/resized/0000/0433/433v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"WonderHowTo","permalink":"wonderhowto","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0000/3385/3385v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3385/3385v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3385/3385v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"FindHow.com","permalink":"findhow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/0805/20805v1-max-150x150.png"],[[190,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/0805/20805v1-max-250x250.png"],[[190,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/0805/20805v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"WatchDoit","permalink":"watchdoit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/0328/20328v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/0328/20328v2-max-250x250.png"],[[287,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/0328/20328v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Tel Aviv","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":32.0554,"longitude":34.7595}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
