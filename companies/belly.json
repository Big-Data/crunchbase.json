Belly offers one customer loyalty card (and iPhone &amp; Android App) to replace the rest. Earn a free cup of coffee at the joint down the street or the opportunity to name a sandwich at your local deli. For the first time, consumers can have their cake and eat it too, or at least have the option of shoving their baker’s face into it. </p>\n\n<p>Businesses profit from gaining access to their user database and can learn who their customers are, how often they’re coming in and what kind of experience they’re jonesin’ for next. Belly gives businesses the tools to market to their favorite customers by reaching out to them through email campaigns and social media tools. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0016/6205/166205v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0016/6205/166205v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0016/6205/166205v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Logan","last_name":"LaHive","permalink":"logan-lahive","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO / Head of Product","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Ulliott","permalink":"craig-ulliott","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Jeffery","permalink":"ryan-jeffery-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Arman","last_name":"Ghosh","permalink":"arman-ghosh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Developer","person":{"first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"Grant","permalink":"jonah-grant","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Device Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Ingebrigtsen","permalink":"chris-ingebrigtsen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Web Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"O'Connor","permalink":"jay-oconnor","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Groupon","permalink":"groupon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-150x150.png"],[[231,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-250x250.png"],[[231,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Swipely","permalink":"swipely","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6445/66445v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0006/6445/66445v1-max-250x250.png"],[[291,83],"assets/images/resized/0006/6445/66445v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"BuzzTable","permalink":"buzztable","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0020/2549/202549v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0020/2549/202549v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[270,76],"assets/images/resized/0020/2549/202549v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$12.9M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/08/customer-loyalty-and-rewards-platform-for-local-businesses-belly-raises-10m-from-andreessen-horowitz/","source_description":"Customer Loyalty And Rewards Platform For Local Businesses Belly Raises $10M From Andreessen Horowitz","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":7,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Andreessen Horowitz","permalink":"andreessen-horowitz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/5679/65679v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/5679/65679v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[432,212],"assets/images/resized/0006/5679/65679v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":375000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Lightbank","permalink":"lightbank","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0008/0401/80401v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0008/0401/80401v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/0401/80401v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":2500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Lightbank","permalink":"lightbank","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0008/0401/80401v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0008/0401/80401v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/0401/80401v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Silicon Valley Bank","permalink":"silicon-valley-bank-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0006/1420/61420v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,31],"assets/images/resized/0006/1420/61420v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,56],"assets/images/resized/0006/1420/61420v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"60654","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
