Sense data is almost always noisy, blurry, occluded, and an ultimately incomplete 2D snapshot of a 3D world. For the past three decades, these uncertainties have foiled our best efforts to create automated systems for understanding the world as we experience it.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is one type of system that handles these problems with ease. The best general purpose reasoning system evolved millions of years ago, and comes preinstalled in every human brain. With a little help from neuroscience and biology, we are pioneering new algorithms that enable computers to become intelligent.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0012/1350/121350v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0012/1350/121350v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,115],"assets/images/resized/0012/1350/121350v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"D.
