The limit is determined by the used playback system (PC, cell phones, portable audio players).</li>\n<li>The tracks type and compression used: wav, mp3, ogg vorbis, wma.\nA compressed iKlax file generally sizes between 25 &amp; 40 MB.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>iKLAX &amp; AUDIO STANDARDS</p>\n\n<p>iKlax respects the audio standards set by MPEG (tags, compression, interlacing, encapsulation).\nIt is cross-sytems compatible (PC, Mac, Linux, PDA, portable media players, &#8230;).</p>\n\n<p>LIBRARIES &amp; THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS INTEGRATION</p>\n\n<p>iKlax is a proprietary format.\nThis means that compression and playback libraries are not open source.\nWould you wish to produce a device that would carry iKlax technology, please feel free posting us your request through the FORM.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/9191/29191v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0002/9191/29191v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,155],"assets/images/resized/0002/9191/29191v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"iKlax Player","permalink":"iklax-player","image":null},{"name":"iKlax Creator Pro","permalink":"iklax-creator-pro","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9192/29192v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/9192/29192v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/9192/29192v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"iKlax Mobile Apps","permalink":"iklax-mobile-apps","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Owen","last_name":"Lagadec","permalink":"owen-lagadec","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Audizen","permalink":"audizen","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"MXP4","permalink":"mxp4","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/4258/44258v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,164],"assets/images/resized/0004/4258/44258v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,295],"assets/images/resized/0004/4258/44258v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.midenews.com/fr/presse/article/lire?id=1763","source_description":"iklaxmusic.com, une plateforme de musique orientÃ©e web 2.0","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Izarbel Technopolis","address2":"Espace Entreprise 1","zip_code":"64210","city":"BIDART","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":43.4477272,"longitude":-1.5555799}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/6221/26221v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0002/6221/26221v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0002/6221/26221v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[70,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1526/51526v2-max-150x150.png"],[[117,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/1526/51526v2-max-250x250.png"],[[211,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/1526/51526v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[70,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1534/51534v2-max-150x150.png"],[[117,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/1534/51534v2-max-250x250.png"],[[211,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/1534/51534v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2008/04/08/iklax-media-releases-multi-track-interactive-audio-format","title":"iKlax Media Releases Multi-track Interactive Audio Format"},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iklax","title":"Wikipedia"},{"external_url":"http://badaboomblog.wordpress.com/2009/01/19/iklax-la-musique-du-futur-debarque-sur-itunes/","title":"iKlax, la musique du futur dÃ©barque sur iPhone"}]}
