Fidg&#8217;t brings together contacts from across multiple networks and platforms allowing for the easier leveraging of social networks from the one place.</p>\n\n<p>Fidg&#8217;t mobile is also a fully fledged online Instant Messaging platform that provides similar functionality to Trillian and Meebo with support for AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and MSN/Windows Live Messenger. Media handling on the mobile version includes the ability to post directly to Flickr or stream content from Last.fm.</p>\n\n<p>The Fidg&#8217;t Visualization Tool has a wow factor to it. The tech behind it might not be exciting but visually it&#8217;s stunning (the video below probably doesn&#8217;t do it full justice). It does however require a download. Windows, Mac and Linux are all supported.</p>\n\n<p>Fidg&#8217;t&#8217;s current support of social networks is limited. Three chat platforms, Flickr and Last.fm means that in its current form it&#8217;s not going to appeal to everyone. Facebook, Digg, del.icio.us, Eventful and Upcoming support is planned, with the Fidg&#8217;t team open to further suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>(Source: techcrunch.com)</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/3447/23447v1-max-150x150.png"],[[108,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/3447/23447v1-max-250x250.png"],[[108,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/3447/23447v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"Sciammarella","permalink":"eduardo-sciammarella","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Advisors","person":{"first_name":"Howard","last_name":"Rheingold","permalink":"howard-rheingold","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board of Directors & Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Moon","permalink":"bernard-moon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0540/10540v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[124,159],"assets/images/resized/0001/0540/10540v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[124,159],"assets/images/resized/0001/0540/10540v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"FriendFeed","permalink":"friendfeed","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/1096/1096v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1096/1096v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1096/1096v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Santa Monica","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.01052,"longitude":-118.495981}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/10/fidgt-central-control-of-social-networks/","title":"Fidgâ€™t: Central Control of Social Networks"}]}
