Registered users can use our service as a meeting place and exchange PC video cards with each other. Listed PC Video Cards will often carry a lower price compared to the same card offered through a regular online hardware store. In many cases the savings will be substantial. </p>\n\n<p>Here is how the process works:\nSellers place the video card classifieds in a predefined category that corresponds to type of the graphics hardware they want to sell. \nBuyers browse for available VGA cards and buy them directly from sellers. \nSellers and buyers negotiate payment and shipping directly with each other using our web service as a meeting place. \nFinally, at the end of the transaction both sellers and buyers can exchange feedback and end the transaction. \nVGATrader.com is a free service. We do not charge any kind of listing fees. Instead we rely on non intrusive Googleâ€™s text ads service â€“ adsense and PayPal donations for the revenue.</p>\n\n<p>The overall experience that we are aiming for is a combination of the EBayÂ® like interface + free CraigslistÂ® elements + some of the formalized aspects of forums trading. We are trying to blend all 3 of those into a single package and hopefully not only appeal to the community of PC hardware enthusiasts, but also to new people that are confused about the available choices of video cards.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/2677/22677v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/2677/22677v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,109],"assets/images/resized/0002/2677/22677v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Lepczak","permalink":"adam-lepczak","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1636 Annabelle St","address2":"","zip_code":"48220","city":"Fenrdale","state_code":"MI","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.468954,"longitude":-83.121161}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
