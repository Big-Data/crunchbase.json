Veritable, their predictive database, goes beyond traditional big data analytics by learning the deep structure of data and generating predictions that reflect all of these relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The complex probabilistic models behind PKâ€™s infer-structure grew out of many years of research at MIT. Prior Knowledge continues to advance the state-of-the-art in probabilistic inference in order to tackle the size and complexity of modern datasets, and to let regular developers exploit these advances. </p>\n\n<p>Prior Knowledge is backed by Founders Fund and independent angel investors.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://gigaom.com/cloud/exclusive-prior-knowledge-wants-to-be-your-data-oracle/","source_description":"Exclusive: Prior Knowledge wants to be your data oracle","raised_amount":1400000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Founders Fund","permalink":"founders-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/2071/2071v11-max-150x150.png"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2071/2071v11-max-250x250.png"],[[333,201],"assets/images/resized/0000/2071/2071v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"5 3rd St.","address2":"Suite 815","zip_code":"94103","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style='text-align:center'>\r\n\r\n<object width='430' height='265' id='FiveminPlayer' classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000'>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowfullscreen' value='true'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='movie' value='http://embed.5min.com/517476423/'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='wmode' value='opaque' />\r\n\r\n<embed name='FiveminPlayer' src='http://embed.5min.com/517476423/' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='430' height='265' allowfullscreen='true' allowScriptAccess='always' wmode='opaque'>\r\n\r\n</embed>\r\n\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n</div>","description":"<p>PK Demo TechCrunch Disrupt 2012</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
