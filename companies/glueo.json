The modified image then he uploads back to the application.</p>\n\n<p>The picture is stored as a bitmap (is made up of pixels) – so it is possible to display anything (there is no any restriction like some predefined objects etc…).</p>\n\n<p>Every part of the image (every pixel) has its own metadata (author name, optionally title or URL hyperlink). It is also possible to reference any place on the canvas by URL (which contains coordinates). So the whole canvas can act like a HTML document.</p>\n\n<p>So, the application has following key features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple authors can cooperate on one artwork</li>\n<li>The artwork is never–ending \n(can grow dynamically)</li>\n<li>Any part of the picture can have its own title and URL hyperlink</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0017/3377/173377v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0017/3377/173377v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0017/3377/173377v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
