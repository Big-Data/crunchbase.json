It is essentially ‘Banking 2.0’. It gives you all the latest banking capabilities as well as mobile payments. In addition, you earn Buzz Points (Waspit currency) when you tell friends and merchants about your experiences. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, we trust our friends’ recommendations more than those we read on random websites. By sharing our experiences, good and bad, we get to make better decisions on where, when and how to spend our money. </p>\n\n<p>Better still, not only is Waspit the best thing to come out since “the internet” – it’s completely free! No account keeping fees, no credit checks, no opportunity to get into debt! </p>\n\n<p>It seems none of the big banks or banking alternatives are taking students seriously. It’s about time that you show your bank who’s number one – you!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0009/2629/92629v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0009/2629/92629v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,127],"assets/images/resized/0009/2629/92629v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Innovative mobile payments system.","permalink":"innovative-mobile-payments-system","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Waspit HQ, USA","address1":"35 W. 35th Street","address2":"Suite 502","zip_code":"10001","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"25 Gilbert Street","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Perspective Launch Date","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":11,"source_url":"","source_text":"","source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Waspit","permalink":"waspit"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/3583/93583v2-max-150x150.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3583/93583v2-max-250x250.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3583/93583v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/3584/93584v2-max-150x150.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3584/93584v2-max-250x250.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3584/93584v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/3585/93585v2-max-150x150.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3585/93585v2-max-250x250.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3585/93585v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/3586/93586v2-max-150x150.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3586/93586v2-max-250x250.png"],[[141,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/3586/93586v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/1710/211710v2-max-150x150.png"],[[184,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/1710/211710v2-max-250x250.png"],[[331,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/1710/211710v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
