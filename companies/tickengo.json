Going to and from the airport, commuting, visiting friends, attending a conference, and any other activity requiring a ride is easy, social and cheap with Tickengo.</p>\n\n<p>Anybody who has Internet access or a smartphone can easily request rides. It is friendly, awesome, and reliable citizens who want to share their available seats and get reimbursed in a flexible way.</p>\n\n<p>Tickengo (http://tickengo.com) is more peer-to-peer and collaborative than its competitors because it has never hired any professional drivers and doesn’t supervise any drivers. It’s a community where everyone is invited with no discrimination. For example, everyday occasional drivers would not put mustaches or other identification marks on their cars! They would not work shifts every week. They may give 1 or 2 rides per month or per year to help out.</p>\n\n<p>Tickengo has 10,000 volunteer drivers already and is growing at a rate of 500 new drivers per week. Tickengo&#8217;s goal is to fill up cars that have empty seats, not create a new managed fleet of professional or semi-professional drivers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0010/9064/109064v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/9064/109064v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0010/9064/109064v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Geoff","last_name":"Mathieux","permalink":"geoff-mathieux","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jeremie","last_name":"Romand","permalink":"jeremie-romand","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,134],"assets/images/resized/0012/9128/129128v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,223],"assets/images/resized/0012/9128/129128v2-max-250x250.png"],[[447,400],"assets/images/resized/0012/9128/129128v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Frederic","last_name":"Gomez","permalink":"frdric-gomez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lawyer and Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Willie","last_name":"Brown","permalink":"willie-brown","image":{"available_sizes":[[[83,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/9857/219857v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[138,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/9857/219857v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,301],"assets/images/resized/0021/9857/219857v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Willie_Brown_in_2006.jpg\" title=\"Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Christof","last_name":"Baumbach","permalink":"christof-baumbach","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/04/tickengo/","source_description":"Tickengo Closes Seed Round With Kima Ventures So You Can Charge Hitchhikers","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":4,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Kima Ventures","permalink":"kima-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/7395/77395v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0007/7395/77395v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0007/7395/77395v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2011 Pine Court","address2":"","zip_code":"94014","city":"Daly City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UEFlUrl6xEA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Tickengo - How it works</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0012/9108/129108v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,134],"assets/images/resized/0012/9108/129108v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,241],"assets/images/resized/0012/9108/129108v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0017/5003/175003v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0017/5003/175003v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,237],"assets/images/resized/0017/5003/175003v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
