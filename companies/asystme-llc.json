As with a human assistant, our software knows the user’s situation (context) and anticipates needs. </p>\n\n<p>Our assistant (patent pending) is comprised of an open, cloud-based platform, a variety of &#8220;assistant services&#8221; and our smartphone app. The platform manages knowledge of the user’s context, hosts services (each interacting with a data source and automating a task), allows collaboration between services, and manages interactions (voice or text) with users. The platform pushes notifications to a user via our smartphone app, which will be available for each of the popular smartphone platforms. </p>\n\n<p>We make it easy for developers to create additional &#8220;assistant services.&#8221; AsystMe and its ecosystem will develop a wide range of services; some will inform, others will manage a facet of life (e.g., exercise program, shopping) or manage a device (e.g. car, home automation system).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0020/1583/201583v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0020/1583/201583v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[389,140],"assets/images/resized/0020/1583/201583v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"Nash","permalink":"joel-nash","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Raeuchle","permalink":"thomas-raeuchle","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Product Mgmt","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Kosieracki","permalink":"chris-kosieracki","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board of Governors","person":{"first_name":"Clint","last_name":"Jurgens","permalink":"clint-jurgens","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board of Governors","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Weber","permalink":"robert-weber","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0005/9879/59879v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0005/9879/59879v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0005/9879/59879v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rob Weber / <a href=\"http://www.W3i.com\" title=\"W3i\" rel=\"nofollow\">W3i</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"AsystMe, LLC","address1":"10620 Little Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"55387","city":"Waconia","state_code":"MN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.asystme.com/","title":"AsystMe"}]}
