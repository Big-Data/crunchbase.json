It’s also where smart parents go when they need to find or get rid of kid’s things. No fees. No mark-ups. Just great stuff from other parents.</p>\n\n<p>We recognize that it takes a village to raise our kids, and having a supportive community of parents certainly makes it easier. Our goal is for people to consider the resources that already exist around them when needing things for their kids. Obviously, there’s an environmental objective here — we want to extend the life of useful things that bring value to the community. And financially it’s a no-brainer to purchase, sell and swap pre-owned goods. But most importantly, we see an opportunity to strengthen our communities by bringing people together who have shared interests and values.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0009/2179/92179v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0009/2179/92179v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[374,137],"assets/images/resized/0009/2179/92179v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Dori","last_name":"Graff","permalink":"dori-graff","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0009/2180/92180v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,185],"assets/images/resized/0009/2180/92180v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,333],"assets/images/resized/0009/2180/92180v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"213 East Fourth Street, Suite 408","address2":"","zip_code":"55101","city":"Saint Paul","state_code":"MN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0009/2051/92051v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,189],"assets/images/resized/0009/2051/92051v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,340],"assets/images/resized/0009/2051/92051v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
