We connect users with a talent or skill to share and those with a desire to learn. Our members benefit by sharing their knowledge and earning an income at the same time. It&#8217;s great to be rewarded for teaching what you love to do! In addition, we provide an affordable and enjoyable way for people to experience their city, develop new skills and pursue their interests. At Kezaar, we celebrate real life learning! </p>\n\n<p>We are creating a global network of highly skilled professionals – covering lifestyle, health &amp; fitness, photography, culinary skills, the arts, entrepreneurs, personal &amp; professional coaches and more. We are building an island-wide network of venue partners who have available real estate space suitable for conducting classes and workshops. As we build our business, we are contributing a percentage of fees earned to local, Singapore-based charities.</p>\n\n<p>Kezaar Social Learning Pte. Ltd. is a privately funded start-up founded in 2012 by a team of experienced professionals Debbie Lee, Kriti Kapoor, Chua Seng Teong and Alex Lam.
