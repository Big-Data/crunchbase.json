In addition, Miradore’s 3rd party connectors for Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft WSUS, and many antivirus products, for example, ensure maximum asset integrity by cross-referencing all your enterprise’s information sources.</p>\n\n<p>With Miradore&#8217;s built-in configuration management system, changes to devices are easily implemented and automatically recorded in the configuration management database. When a device is reinstalled, all the user’s information is re-applied to the device to eliminate the need for technicians to spend hours restoring the device to its original state. Every action in Miradore is recorded and logged, helping enterprises achieve more transparency throughout their customers’ operations and improving SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) compliance.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0022/0222/220222v1-max-150x150.png"],[[189,62],"assets/images/resized/0022/0222/220222v1-max-250x250.png"],[[189,62],"assets/images/resized/0022/0222/220222v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kristian","last_name":"Järnefelt","permalink":"kristian-jrnefelt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mika","last_name":"Liukko","permalink":"mika-liukko","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€1.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/finnish-byod-startup-miradore-raises-e1-2-million-series-b-backed-by-inventure-for-global-sales-push/","source_description":"Finnish BYOD Startup, Miradore, Raises €1.2 Million Series B, Backed By Inventure, For Global Sales Push","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":13,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Willem","last_name":"Hendrickx","permalink":"willem-hendrickx","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Inventure Capital","permalink":"inventure-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0004/9941/49941v1-max-150x150.png"],[[197,24],"assets/images/resized/0004/9941/49941v1-max-250x250.png"],[[197,24],"assets/images/resized/0004/9941/49941v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Laserkatu 6","address2":"","zip_code":"53850 ","city":"Lappeenranta","state_code":null,"country_code":"FIN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
