Free value added photo services include manual color correction, cropping, and scratch removal.</p>\n\n<p>A major service differentiator is ScanCafeâ€™s policy that customers only have to pay for the scans they want to keep - 50% minimum of scanned images. Thus, the process of pre-sorting images has been eliminated. This means customers no longer have to spend hours sifting through vast negative, slide, or photo archives to determine which images are worth scanning.</p>\n\n<p>All of ScanCafeâ€™s technicians and graphics artists have a background in digital graphic art and/or photography.  Employees also receive training and certification in the areas of color concepts and ICC profiles, Adobe Photoshop, and image restoration to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>Prices start at $0.29 per negative at 3000 dpi, with higher resolutions up to 4000 dpi available.  Digital scans can be saved in JPG or TIFF file format depending on the customerâ€™s needs.  Black and white images are accepted, as well as newspaper clippings, letters, and paper artwork. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/5907/15907v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/5907/15907v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/5907/15907v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2008/08/photo_scannings.html","source_description":"alarm:clock","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":13,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sigma Partners","permalink":"sigma-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0000/3568/3568v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,22],"assets/images/resized/0000/3568/3568v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[399,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3568/3568v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1475 Rollins Road","address2":"","zip_code":"94010","city":"Burlingame","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.592584,"longitude":-122.369676}],"milestones":[{"description":"32M images scanned since launch","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":9,"source_url":"http://www.scancafe.com","source_text":"","source_description":"scancafe website","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"ScanCafe","permalink":"scancafe"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/6350/46350v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/6350/46350v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0004/6350/46350v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
