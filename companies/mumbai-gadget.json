Itâ€™s something we do in our spare time driven by our love for gadgets. The Websiteis meant to be personal and as such it will express personal opinions about the topics discussed.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it is digital cameras and DSLRs, computers, laptops, computer hardware, robots or just plain sci-fi movies, you name it, weâ€™ve probably got somebody keeping a close eye on it. Not because weâ€™re paid to do it, but instead because weâ€™re driven by natural curiosity in all things high-tech.</p>\n\n<p>You will soon learn that our personal passions and interests stretch way beyond mobile phones, which are the main topic of MumbaiGadget.com.</p>\n\n<p>So quite naturally, it occurred to us that perhaps youâ€™d be interested in getting our scoop of the most interesting tech toys of the day. We hardly miss an announcement or a demo of an exciting new gadget and we thought itâ€™s about time we start putting those down in writing, as well.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, by having our personal say through the blog, weâ€™d be able to release cellphone news and even coverage that we normally donâ€™t provide through MumbaiGadget.com for various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Besides providing news scoops, the MumbaiGadget Websitewill give us an opportunity to review other products besides cellphones or present our research on interesting high-tech topics that donâ€™t necessarily have something to do with mobile phones.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the MumbaiGadget Websitecan also be a place to share some funny stuff from the mobile industry and if youâ€™ve come to appreciate what our team does in the field of mobile phones, youâ€™d certainly find it interesting to see us covering other stuff as well. At least we hope you would.</p>\n\n<p>Well, thatâ€™s about it.
