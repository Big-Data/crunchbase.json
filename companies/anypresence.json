It is the only solution that offers organizations of any size the ability to assemble and deploy HTML5, native iOS and Android apps without having to install any software.</p>\n\n<p>Powered by a robust mobile back-end-as-a-service, AnyPresence also provides pre-assembled mobile app templates, SMS, push-notifications, and other capabilities to further accelerate time-to-market. The platform is easy to use, yet flexible enough to enable source code-level customization or on-premise hosting options, with no platform “lock-in”.</p>\n\n<p>Why AnyPresence?</p>\n\n<p>The post-iPhone mobile era offers a promising new channel for connecting consumers and businesses through mobile-capabilities that surpass traditional fixed devices. Leveraging this channel offers several challenges, however, much like the development traditional desktop-based apps of the past. AnyPresence helps businesses overcome the two biggest hurdles:</p>\n\n<p>1) Adapts to New Devices and OS Versions</p>\n\n<p>New mobile devices and operating system fragmentation continues to increase, seemingly with each passing month. Building a mobile app or web site that supports a broad spectrum of devices – and therefore audiences – becomes correspondingly more difficult as each new device or operating system is released. Furthermore, new web-connected devices, such as smart televisions, continue to increase in relevance. AnyPresence helps businesses support these channels through a cross-platform framework that generates apps for modern mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and embedded browsers with HTML5-compatibility. The platform can also be extended to adapt to new devices and operating systems as they emerge.</p>\n\n<p>2) Lowers Development Cost and Complexity</p>\n\n<p>The AnyPresence Platform is focused on simplifying the process of building mobile apps that run on many devices. The challenge with other mobile platforms is that they are primarily focused on providing toolkits to developers. You still require the technical expertise and time to install software developer kits (SDKs), author code, and set up the appropriate infrastructure to power the apps. The AnyPresence approach provides you with pre-built templates for common mobile app scenarios, and lets you use an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to assemble a mobile app quickly. Your app can then be easily “published” to your audience as an HTML5 app or through the mobile app store of your choice.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0017/8305/178305v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0017/8305/178305v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,74],"assets/images/resized/0017/8305/178305v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO
