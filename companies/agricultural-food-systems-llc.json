It seeks to increase value and build trust among agricultural producers, processors, and consumers. AFS offers a new product to assess meat tenderness accurately: the TenderID. </p>\n\n<p>Large beef processors in the United States have the opportunity to earn over $75 million in additional annual revenue by measuring meat tenderness effectively. According to the USDA, “tenderness is the most sought-after guarantee for all levels of the meat industry&#8217;s sales cycle, &amp; surveys show that consumers are willing to pay a premium for meat that is guaranteed tender.” However, the beef industry hasn&#8217;t found a way to meet consumer needs yet. This shortcoming means tough beef product remains “a costly &amp; contentious issue for everyone involved in putting meat on the table.”</p>\n\n<p>Agricultural Food Systems provides beef processors with the ability to accurately measure beef tenderness so that they can more effectively communicate meat quality to consumers. Additionally, the company’s product, the TenderID, provides processors with an average of $24.40 in additional revenue per carcass. The product gives them the advantages of more efficient processing and consistently accurate tenderness measurements.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about Agricultural Food Systems on their website: http://agfoodsystems.wordpress.com/</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/2302/212302v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/2302/212302v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/2302/212302v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Mailing Address","address1":"PO Box 6122","address2":"","zip_code":"72766","city":"Springdale","state_code":"AR","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BTWgOmYEZnM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>AFS Elevator Pitch</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
