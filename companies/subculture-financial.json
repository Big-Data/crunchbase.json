We partner with large consumer brands and trusted iconic influencers to deepen emotional connections from these brands to their loyal card members. We developed the CREAMâ„¢ on-line and mobile platform, which provides better financial services, social rewards, mobile commerce and mobile banking services with loyalty programs at lower costs. </p>\n\n<p>Our primary target market is the consumer loaded sector that is attracted to our licensorsâ€™ products and incentives. Our card members tend to follow â€œtrustedâ€ cultural representatives and family members. Our members are &#8220;aspirational&#8221; in that they have an appreciation for â€œhigher endâ€ services at better costs, but find the overall offerings of today lacking in quality. They are also â€œbrand awareâ€ smartphone holders who are tech savvy and want to access the financial service mainstream. </p>\n\n<p>Company Philosophy and Strategy \nWe believe in philanthropy and helping our consumers gain familiarity with financial services at appropriate costs. We will be leveraging the growth in smartphone adoption and usage by providing the consumer loaded market with numerous apps/technologies not available to them today. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0015/8225/158225v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0015/8225/158225v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,346],"assets/images/resized/0015/8225/158225v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President | Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Chase","permalink":"stephen-chase-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Hollander","permalink":"jonathan-hollander","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/1568/151568v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/1568/151568v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/1568/151568v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>jonathan hollander</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Chase","permalink":"stephen-chase-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"477 Madison Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"10022","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0015/8224/158224v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0015/8224/158224v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,346],"assets/images/resized/0015/8224/158224v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
