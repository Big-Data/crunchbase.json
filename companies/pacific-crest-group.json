Weâ€™ve built our business in the San Francisco Bay Area by adding new staff with expertise in human resources and employee development, business development, and information technology.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to help your business become more successful in your terms. For some clients, this means dramatic financial growth; for others, itâ€™s about running more efficiently, or focusing on your customers instead of back-office administration.</p>\n\n<p>PCG approaches financial and business management much like doctors treat patients. Certain circumstances call for the resolution of a specific isolated problem, while others require a more holistic approach that considers many aspects of a businessâ€™ well being.</p>\n\n<p>We eliminate obstacles to your successâ€”for example, inadequate financial processes or cumbersome IT systemsâ€”and to enhance your most valuable resource, the people who work for you.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond our unparalleled competency in accounting and finance, Pacific Crest Groupâ€™s real strength lies in our ability to recognize organizational needs and opportunities for improvement. We know how to optimize and integrate your financial procedures, computer systems, and human resources, such that you can focus on what you do best and grow your business to its full potential.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,119],"assets/images/resized/0012/4038/124038v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,124],"assets/images/resized/0012/4038/124038v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,124],"assets/images/resized/0012/4038/124038v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and General Partner","person":{"first_name":"TJ","last_name":"Van Voorhees","permalink":"tj-van-voorhees","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and General Parnter","person":{"first_name":"Franka","last_name":"Winchester","permalink":"franka-winchester","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"80 East Sir Francis Drake Blvd., Suite 1B","address2":"","zip_code":"94939","city":"Larkspur","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.pcg-services.com/services/accounting/","title":"Accounting Services"},{"external_url":"http://www.pcg-services.com/services/employee-development/","title":"Human Resources"},{"external_url":"http://www.pcg-services.com/services/information-technology/it-services/","title":"Information Technology"},{"external_url":"http://www.pcg-services.com/services/accounting/start-ups/","title":"Startup Services"},{"external_url":"http://www.google.com/profiles/pacificcrestgroup","title":"Pacific Crest Group Company Profile"}]}
