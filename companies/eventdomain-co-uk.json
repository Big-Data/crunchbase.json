The business was founded due to the frustration of not finding a suitable venue locally, with major search engines failing to categorise this important information for searchers. Eventdomain is an online database of B2b event suppliers, created to aid the event planning process for the public.</p>\n\n<p>The site only serves companies in the Hospitality sector therefore targeting the companies directly, delivering the correct visitors to these companies, matching event suppliers to event planners. Using the innovative approach of having all this venue info in â€˜one placeâ€™, provides users with the â€˜Convenience Factorâ€™, and in doing so thus gives advertisers 100% targeted advertising which is much needed in todayâ€™s world of searchâ€¦. â€œWe had so much event-related information to display, that only a database driven search engine could provide what we wanted for event planners and organisers. â€œ</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
