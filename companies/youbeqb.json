The startup lets fantasy players score points and move up in the ranks by choosing what offensive plays will be called next in live football games. Normal fantasy sports leagues base their scoring and ranking on choosing players before games start, but YouBeQB is different because it allows fantasy players to make decisions during games.  </p>\n\n<p>Fantasy players have to make decisions before plays actually start. They awarded varying amounts of points depending on the play they choose, with more rare or difficult plays earning more points.  </p>\n\n<p>Founder Kris Billmaier used to play an informal version of YouBeQB with friends during football games, but decided to develop it into an actual online game. The company has raised funding from people with football connections including NFL greats Ronnie Lott and Joe Montana. The company plans on developing partnerships with both the NFL and the NCAA.  </p>\n\n<p>Competitors include <a href=\"http://www.buzztime.com/\" title=\"NTN Buzztime\" rel=\"nofollow\">NTN Buzztime</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,108],"assets/images/resized/0000/0034/34v1-max-150x150.png"],[[145,108],"assets/images/resized/0000/0034/34v1-max-250x250.png"],[[145,108],"assets/images/resized/0000/0034/34v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"YouBeQB","permalink":"youbeqb","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kris","last_name":"Billmaier","permalink":"kris-billmaier","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Whitsitt","permalink":"bob-whitsitt","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Savoy","permalink":"bill-savoy","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Abramowitz","permalink":"paul-abramowitz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/328857_vc24.html?source=rss","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"HRJ Capital","permalink":"hrj-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0002/8108/28108v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/8108/28108v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/8108/28108v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"Bellevue","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":47.597965,"longitude":-122.151158}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
