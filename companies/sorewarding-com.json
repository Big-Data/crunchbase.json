With our brand new Consumer Driven Deals platform, consumers can now send deal requests to local merchants, who can accept, reject, or counter-offer with the click of a button. For every money-saving offer purchased, SoRewarding donates 5% of the offer price to a local non-profit.</p>\n\n<p>SoRewarding is a win for everyone. Consumers create the deals they want, when they want. Merchants reach new customers, under the terms they want, and have a way to further engage their customers. Non-profits have a steady revenue stream that requires only one person to manage. Organizations have a centralized location for communication and event planning. SoRewarding creates an online eco-system that facilitates exchange, enhances communication, fosters growth, and unifies your community.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/0776/180776v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/0776/180776v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/0776/180776v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1660 S.
