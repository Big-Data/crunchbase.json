Early research led to unique developments that enable AirSage to provide more accurate location information, ubiquitous traffic coverage of roadways, and time-of-day traffic patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Today, AirSage has the widest coverage of any real-time location and movement provider in the country. We collect and analyze real-time mobile signals to produce over fifteen billon anonymous locations every day. By turning every mobile phone into a mobile data sensor AirSage provides unmatched scale and accuracy, while fully protecting user privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisers, social networking sites, DOTs, urban planners, emergency responders and a host of others finally have easy access to data that they can use for modeling and forecasting the location, movement and flow of people throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>The data can easily be integrated into larger migration, demographic and socio-economic models, giving our customers an edge when solving traffic congestion, planning for urban growth, creating targeted marketing and advertising campaigns, or building stronger customer relationships.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,11],"assets/images/resized/0008/4228/84228v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,18],"assets/images/resized/0008/4228/84228v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,33],"assets/images/resized/0008/4228/84228v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Cy","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"cy-smith","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sr. VP Research & Development ","person":{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"Watts","permalink":"nancy-watts","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & President","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Swayne","permalink":"greg-swayne","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Management & Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Moe","permalink":"andrea-moe","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Forster","permalink":"ken-forster","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$6M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.redherring.com/Home/20071","source_description":"AirSage Gets $6M for Traffic","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Constellation Ventures","permalink":"constellation-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0002/3460/23460v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[245,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/3460/23460v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[245,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/3460/23460v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1330 Spring Street NW","address2":"Suite 400","zip_code":" 30309","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
