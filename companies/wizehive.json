It combines microblogging features found in Twitter and Yammer,  project management features found in BaseCamp, and general collaboration and organizational features found in SharePoint and Lotus Notes.   Like Yammer, WizeHive lets groups of folks establish a private and continuous feed of activity.  By setting up a private workspace, WizeHive users can communicate on one or more topics through a browser interface, a desktop client, or most importantly, by sending and receiving emails.   But WizeHive extends the Yammer model by allowing those with multiple interests or groups to set up separate workspaces for each group yet optionally see all of the activity in one integrated feed.</p>\n\n<p>Messages entered or sent through WizeHive can contain text, links, graphics and attached files.   Uploaded files can be shared among workspace members and most Word or Excel compatible files can  be edited collaboratively right from within WizeHive.</p>\n\n<p>WizeHive extends the collaboration model further by providing task integrated management where you can organize and manage yourself and optionally your co-workers.   You can assign and manage tasks for each workspace independently or organize and manage your own activities across all workspaces. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0003/2717/32717v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0003/2717/32717v1-max-250x250.png"],[[261,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/2717/32717v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Levinson","permalink":"michael-levinson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,132],"assets/images/resized/0005/6225/56225v1-max-150x150.png"],[[130,132],"assets/images/resized/0005/6225/56225v1-max-250x250.png"],[[130,132],"assets/images/resized/0005/6225/56225v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Carson","permalink":"mike-carson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0131/100131v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/0131/100131v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,258],"assets/images/resized/0010/0131/100131v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Jjingo Bagenzekukola","permalink":"samuel-jjingo-bagenzekukola-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Yammer","permalink":"yammer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/4256/24256v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/4256/24256v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,92],"assets/images/resized/0002/4256/24256v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Present.ly","permalink":"present-ly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/5277/25277v2-max-150x150.png"],[[216,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/5277/25277v2-max-250x250.png"],[[216,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/5277/25277v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Producteev","permalink":"producteev","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/4705/24705v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/4705/24705v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/4705/24705v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Huddle","permalink":"huddle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/6947/16947v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/6947/16947v8-max-250x250.png"],[[450,133],"assets/images/resized/0001/6947/16947v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wiggio","permalink":"wiggio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0002/5724/25724v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/5724/25724v1-max-250x250.png"],[[306,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/5724/25724v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"LiquidPlanner","permalink":"liquidplanner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Optini","permalink":"optini","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0010/3752/103752v2-max-150x150.png"],[[153,59],"assets/images/resized/0010/3752/103752v2-max-250x250.png"],[[153,59],"assets/images/resized/0010/3752/103752v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Skild","permalink":"skild","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0017/4743/174743v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,110],"assets/images/resized/0017/4743/174743v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[385,170],"assets/images/resized/0017/4743/174743v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$100k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
