Contrary to popular perception, the phrase &#8220;lean startup&#8221; implies much more than capital efficiency. It encompasses a paradigm-shifting way of thinking about how to build new companies and products, and how to bring those products to market faster.</p>\n\n<p>Lean Startup Machine provides participants with a valuable framework of tools, techniques and resources designed to help early-stage companies identify key customers and iterate their products quickly. Startups face incredibly difficult odds, and the vast majority of them will fail. While lean startup methodologies are not a safeguard against failure, they do provide a foundation for real, measurable improvement.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1276/101276v11-max-150x150.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1276/101276v11-max-250x250.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1276/101276v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Trevor","last_name":"Owens","permalink":"trevor-owens","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/3569/203569v2-max-150x150.png"],[[190,190],"assets/images/resized/0020/3569/203569v2-max-250x250.png"],[[190,190],"assets/images/resized/0020/3569/203569v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Trevor Owens / <a href=\"http://leanstartupmachine.com/about\" title=\"Lean Startup Machine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lean Startup Machine</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Liu","permalink":"steven-liu","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Organizer","person":{"first_name":"Kyle","last_name":"Kelly","permalink":"kyle-kelly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/3040/193040v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[242,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/3040/193040v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[435,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/3040/193040v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Kyle Kelly / <a href=\"http://www.munchly.com\" title=\"Munchly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Munchly</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"MacCarrigan","permalink":"ryan-maccarrigan","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Organizer","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Horn","permalink":"josh-horn","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Alley NYC","address1":"500 7th Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"10018","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.slideshare.net/sk2185/san-startup-machine-presentation-4779224","title":"Brief Intro to the Lean Startup Method by San Kim"},{"external_url":"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html","title":"The Lean Startup by Eric Ries"},{"external_url":"http://market-by-numbers.com/","title":"Market By Numbers by Brant Cooper"}]}
