It enables consumers to buy what they see on screen, share their TV viewing habits with friends, and engage with more information about their favourite shows.</p>\n\n<p>For broadcasters, zeebox makes TV more sticky and interactive.  The company provides programme makers with a single destination where their fans can gather, chat, share and interact with their web content.  Finally, zeebox enables web merchants to reach consumers who are inspired to shop by what they see on TV.  </p>\n\n<p>The company was founded in the UK in 2011 by Anthony Rose, former CTO of the BBC iPlayer and Ernesto Schmitt, ex Board Director of EMI Music. </p>\n\n<p>The zeebox web service and iPad app launched in the UK in November 2011, with iPhone version to follow in December and international rollout to other countries in early 2012.  The company has been funded by angel investors to date.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,144],"assets/images/resized/0016/0212/160212v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,240],"assets/images/resized/0016/0212/160212v2-max-250x250.png"],[[315,303],"assets/images/resized/0016/0212/160212v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO, co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Rose","permalink":"anthony-rose","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ernesto","last_name":"Schmitt","permalink":"ernesto-schmitt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Architect","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Nunes","permalink":"alexander-nunes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO, Head of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Max","last_name":"Bleyleben","permalink":"max-bleyleben","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Ravani","permalink":"anthony-ravani","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Rose","permalink":"anthony-rose-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief of Product Development & Content","person":{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Miller","permalink":"simon-miller","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"Covent Garden","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/goRrg4OfaAI.x?p=1\" width=\"370\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#goRrg4OfaAI\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2012/09/zeebox.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0016/0208/160208v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0016/0208/160208v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0016/0208/160208v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0016/0209/160209v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0016/0209/160209v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0016/0209/160209v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0016/0210/160210v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0016/0210/160210v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0016/0210/160210v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0016/0211/160211v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0016/0211/160211v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0016/0211/160211v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
