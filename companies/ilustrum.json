This mixture builds a new way of learning and entertainment while gaming online and meeting people with the same interests.</p>\n\n<p>Trivials are used to complete the decks obtaining the pictures that you miss, in a deck, trivials and pictures are all same topic related. When playing a baseball deck all the questions to get the pictures are related to baseball. Spare ones can then be exchanged with people playing the same deck.</p>\n\n<p>The company has grown from 3k to 60k users during the beta phase in 2011, implemented the freemium and premium model during the same year. Having an income of 100k EUR during the first 6 months of monetization.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0021/9900/219900v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0021/9900/219900v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,159],"assets/images/resized/0021/9900/219900v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬750k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"private_equity","source_url":"http://scribd.com/doc/112292608/La-Vanguardia-02-01-2012","source_description":"La Vanguardia 02/01/2012","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"private_equity","source_url":"http://es.scribd.com/doc/112291634/Articulo-Expansion-01-10-2012-ilustrum-com","source_description":"Expansion 01/10/2012","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Simpple","permalink":"simpple","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Barcelona","state_code":null,"country_code":"ESP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
