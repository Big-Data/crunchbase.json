These critical path links prevent costly rework by showing only top priority critical actions for all project participants.</p>\n\n<p>All participants are integrated into the project structure, from internal staff to vendors and customers.  The customer owns the project and the collaborators own their workflows within the overall project structure - each constraining the others as the project&#8217;s overall critical path demands.</p>\n\n<p>Store emails, phone calls, meeting notes and documents, organized contextually within the workflow, naturally as the work is done. File storage is reliable, secure, online and backed up in multiple secured locations hosted by Amazon&#8217;s S3 Simple Storage Service. Our workflow templates allow capturing of and reusing workflow knowledge and finding information using those templates.  </p>\n\n<p>All active operations within Streamfocus are contextually timed. For example, if you add a document such as a phone call to an action, the system automatically starts a session for you linked to that action as you begin the call.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/9988/19988v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0001/9988/19988v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[407,120],"assets/images/resized/0001/9988/19988v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"StreamFocus","permalink":"streamfocus","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"Gibson","permalink":"fred-gibson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Hinchey","permalink":"mike-hinchey","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"LiquidPlanner","permalink":"liquidplanner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"AtTask","permalink":"attask","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/0501/20501v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/0501/20501v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,135],"assets/images/resized/0002/0501/20501v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"240 2nd Street","address2":"Suite 201","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.78594,"longitude":-122.3978}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/streamfocus-an-organizational-power-tool-waiting-to-be-unleashed/","title":"StreamFocus - An Organizational Power Tool Waiting To Be Unleashed"}]}
