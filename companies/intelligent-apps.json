True to the motto &#8220;turning ideas into Smartphone applications&#8221; the company designs and develops Smartphone Apps, which is exciting for existing and new customers alike. Managing Directors are Niclaus Mewes and Sven Johannes Külper. </p>\n\n<p>In March 2010 Intelligent Apps launched the application myTaxi through which you can order a taxi per click - without calling a switchboard germany-wide. The App is available for drivers and passengers one on each end.    </p>\n\n<p>myTaxi presents itself as an energetic, market-oriented Taxi-Service with steadily increasing  sales figures. 300,000 downloads and a 5-star rating in the App Store has secured the App 1st place in the â€œProductivityâ€ category and places Intelligent Apps GmbH in 3rd place on the Start-ups 2010 list.  5.000 taxi-drivers signed up with the myTaxi-service. Almost 300 Hotels and companies use our service at the reception.</p>\n\n<p>The operating systems are based on iPhone, iPad, Android and Web. </p>\n\n<p>So whatÂ´s next? â€žGermany is already taken, now we have to conquer Europeâ€œ Nic Mewes says with a wink and look on the map. This is a view shared by the venture\ncapital arm of Deutsche Telekom, T-Venture, the investment company e42 GmbH and the KfW Bankengruppe, all of which have invested in Intelligent Apps GmbH and, therefore, supported the development of myTaxi.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/4241/104241v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0010/4241/104241v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0010/4241/104241v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"myTaxi","permalink":"1touchtaxi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/4871/104871v13-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0010/4871/104871v13-max-250x250.png"],[[407,147],"assets/images/resized/0010/4871/104871v13-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board
