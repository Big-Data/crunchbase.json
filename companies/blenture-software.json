Each space has its own set of apps that determine the nature of the space. Spaces can be created at any location, reflecting day-to-day interactions, either among friends and colleagues or people who meet casually in a bar or other location. These spaces allow users to utilize multi-device apps, discover new apps, and share experiences with each other.</p>\n\n<p>Playrock offers app developers an SDK for developing applications to run inside its spaces. With it, any single-player game can become multi-player by providing access to resources and offering tools to connect users. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0019/8169/198169v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0019/8169/198169v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,152],"assets/images/resized/0019/8169/198169v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tamir","last_name":"Rosenblum","permalink":"tamir-rosenblum","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and VP Product","person":{"first_name":"Ariel","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"ariel-cohen-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Amit","last_name":"Schreiber","permalink":"amit-schreiber","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/8348/198348v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/8348/198348v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/8348/198348v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
