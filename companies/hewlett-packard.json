HP is one of the world&#8217;s largest information technology companies and operates in nearly every country. HP specializes in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines include personal computing devices, enterprise servers, related storage devices, as well as a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP markets its products to households, small to medium size businesses and enterprises both directly, via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company originated in a garage in nearby Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with a past professor, Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression. Terman was considered a mentor to them in forming Hewlett-Packard. In 1939, Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard&#8217;s garage with an initial capital investment of US$538. Hewlett and Packard tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard or Packard-Hewlett[ Packard won the coin toss but named their electronics manufacturing enterprise the &#8220;Hewlett-Packard Company&#8221;. HP incorporated on August 18, 1947, and went public on November 6, 1957.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[242,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[291,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"HP
