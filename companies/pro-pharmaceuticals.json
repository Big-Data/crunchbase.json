Its lead product candidate in development, GM-CT-01, is a proprietary polysaccharide galectin inhibitor, which has completed Phase II trials for the treatment of colorectal cancer in combination with 5-FU, a chemotherapy for the treatment of various types of cancer. </p>\n\n<p>The company has research collaborations with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine to study the anti-fibrotic effects of its carbohydrate compounds on liver fibrosis; with Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital to evaluate the anti-fibrotic effects of these compounds to treat acute and chronic kidney disease; and with the Ludwig Institute in Brussels, Belgium to show whether inhibiting the action of galectin-3 improves the efficacy of T lymphocytes in killing tumor cells. </p>\n\n<p>Galectin Therapeutics (previously Pro-Pharmaceuticals) was founded in December 2000 and is based in Newton, Massachusetts.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0006/9262/69262v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/9262/69262v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/9262/69262v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Executive Chairman, Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Czirr","permalink":"james-czirr","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"Anatole","last_name":"Klyosov","permalink":"anatole-klyosov","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO, Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"G.
