The idea for LetSimonDecide.com came from founder Ricardo Solarâ€™s personal experience.  Solar realized he constantly created long lists of pros and cons and later used Excel spreadsheets with weighted factors to make key decisions about his family, home/personal life and career.  Solar decided the world needed a formalized approach, and began researching a scientific method.  LetSimonDecide.com was born.</p>\n\n<p>Ayax is comprised of a multidisciplinary, multilingual team of marketers, mathematicians, researchers, psychologists and former Fortune 500 executives &#8211; you might call them refugees from the world of traditional thinking.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/2787/42787v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,114],"assets/images/resized/0004/2787/42787v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,205],"assets/images/resized/0004/2787/42787v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"LetSimonDecide","permalink":"letsimondecide","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/2788/42788v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0004/2788/42788v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0004/2788/42788v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"Solar","permalink":"ricardo-solar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & VP of Analytics","person":{"first_name":"Ramiro","last_name":"Sanchez","permalink":"ramiro-sanchez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Stanford Professor, Advisor to Ayax","person":{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Holtzman, Ph.D.","permalink":"samuel-holtzman-ph-d","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Psychologist","person":{"first_name":"Caryl","last_name":"Bloom, Ph.D., MFT","permalink":"caryl-bloom-ph-d-mft","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Hunch","permalink":"hunch","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3134/23134v3-max-150x150.png"],[[145,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3134/23134v3-max-250x250.png"],[[145,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3134/23134v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Los Angeles ","address1":"2110 Artesia Blvd.  ","address2":"Suite 258","zip_code":"90278","city":"Redondo Beach","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":33.872521,"longitude":-118.373687}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/0153/70153v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[227,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/0153/70153v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[410,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/0153/70153v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
