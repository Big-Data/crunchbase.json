When a user meets other Poken owners in the real world, they quickly swap information. No more writing down email addresses or long blog names. Just touch Pokens and connect.</p>\n\n<p>The &#8220;digital business card&#8221; also shares screen names and profile IDs from a variety of social networking services like MySpace, FaceBook,  Skype, LinkedIn and others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How a Poken Works</strong>\nOpen an account at http://www.doyoupoken.com and set up your account. Load your social networking profiles, design your &#8220;ID Card&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Poken users can touch Pokens, and look for the green light as they share Facebook, Twitter and other social network profiles.</p>\n\n<p>Users then simply plug the Poken into their computer&#8217;s USB port, and download the data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Models and Variety</strong>\nPokens come in a variety of shapes and models. As of October 2009, the ones most readily available in the U.S. were the brand new Business Poken &#8220;Pulse&#8221;, the Panda Poken, the Alien Poken, the Ninja Poken, the Geisha Poken, the RapStar Poken, the Caveman Poken, the Rockstar Poken, the VooDoo Poken, the Mad-K Poken, the Poken Ghost, the Poken Bee, the Poken Tigress, the Poken Tiger, the Franky Poken, the Poken Pink Alien, the Poken Fox, the Poken Dragon, the Poken Baby, and the Vampire Poken.</p>\n\n<p>The brand new Poken Pulse was introduced in September 2009 in response to requests from corporate customers for a Poken that looked more professional. The Pulse sports a 2GB USB stick in a conservative black style, complete with the integrated Poken sharing technology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Poken as Marketing and Branding Tool</strong>\nCorporate customization and marketing integration of the Poken into a company&#8217;s marketing plan is a specialty of PokenZoo.com.
