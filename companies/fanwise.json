Once aware, users can post a social update - and the machine can issue a credit to the user in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>Marketers control the message that FanWise listens for, so for the first time, marketers can control social media status updates.</p>\n\n<p>FanWise is a computer chip that can go into any machine. It listens for the social status update, and when it sees it, it issues the machine a credit so the user gets a physical social media reward.</p>\n\n<p>Let me put it this way. You walk up to a Coke Machine, and you tweet “#eTips from @StarmarkIntl are great!”, and the machine gives you a credit for a Coke.</p>\n\n<p>Or, you are parking on Fort Lauderdale Beach, and you tweet “#Sunny day @VisitLauderdale #beach” and you get 30 minutes credit on the machine. (Or, one minute for each point on your Klout score. Mind-blown).</p>\n\n<p>How about you are at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino, and you check-in on Facebook with the update “This place is the best!” and you get a free pull on a slot machine.</p>\n\n<p>In exchange for posting the “perfect” social media status update, your fans and followers can get a physical reward, instantly.</p>\n\n<p>And, here is the best part:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To keep the message fresh and engaging, you can update it as often as you want. Change what you promote every day.</li>\n<li>There are detailed potential media impression reports in real-time to report the ROI.</li>\n<li>The social media technology can be used in any machine so you can still dream up the latest, greatest, newest, and best social and mobile marketing.</li>\n<li>As a marketer, your program is ongoing, dynamic, national, and productive. This is an exciting time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>FanWise is still in beta testing, but to learn more about the first social media technology to deliver physical, location-based social media rewards visit fanwi.se</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0021/5697/215697v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0021/5697/215697v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,99],"assets/images/resized/0021/5697/215697v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Starmark","address1":"210 S.
