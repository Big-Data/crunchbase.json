InternMatch focuses on helping start-up companies, small businesses, and non-profit organizations, to find and connect with highly skilled interns.  </p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2009 by Andrew Maguire, InternMatch began as a Washington only platform.  In September of 2010 InternMatch expanded their services to the west coast. Noting that only a very narrow set of large employers had the money, brand, and recruiting know-how to effectively bring on board capable interns, InternMatch focuses on small and mid-size companies. This means InternMatch acts as a discovery tool for internship seekers who traditionally have been funneled into a small set of highly competitive internship opportunities. </p>\n\n<p>To achieve this goal InternMatch claims to focus on three areas:\nFirst, InternMatch is looking to make the internship search and posting process incredibly simple. On the InternMatch platform both internship seekers and employers can search for a match, receive skill and location based matching recommendations, and access tools to manage the application process. Students can also search and apply to opportunities without registering.  </p>\n\n<p>Second, InternMatch has built and continues to construct an evolving library of resources and tools. Students can access tools for resume creation, internship preparation, and more. Organizations can access resources that help with intern management, program development and advice on compensation. </p>\n\n<p>Third, InternMatch has built the infrastructure to help interested students connect with socially responsible positions â€“ especially at nonprofit organizations. Rather than volunteer, students recognize the value in experiential learning that combines positive social impact with career building which is a key tenet for InternMatch.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0012/9812/129812v1-max-150x150.png"],[[237,67],"assets/images/resized/0012/9812/129812v1-max-250x250.png"],[[237,67],"assets/images/resized/0012/9812/129812v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
