The company has 304,000 employees around the world.</p>\n\n<p>GE is a diversified infrastructure, finance and media company taking on the world&#8217;s toughest challenges. From aircraft engines and power generation to financial services, medical imaging, and television programming, GE operates in more than 100 countries and employs about 300,000 people worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>GE has a strong set of global businesses in infrastructure, finance and media aligned to meet today&#8217;s needs, including the demand for global infrastructure; growing and changing demographics that need access to healthcare, finance, and information and entertainment; and environmental technologies.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009, GE delivered solid results despite the tough economic climate with earnings of $11.2 billion. Industrial cash flow from operating activities for the year remained strong at over $16.6 billion.</p>\n\n<p>GE traces its beginnings to Thomas A. Edison, who established Edison Electric Light Company in 1878. In 1892, a merger of Edison General Electric Company and Thomson-Houston Electric Company created General Electric Company. GE is the only company listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Index today that was also included in the original index in 1896.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Immelt","permalink":"jeff-immelt","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0009/3279/93279v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0009/3279/93279v1-max-250x250.png"],[[276,187],"assets/images/resized/0009/3279/93279v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>General
