Knowing the person who refers you to a local business makes the recommendation more trustworthy. Simplicity. Itâ€™s easy to find trusted businesses, easy to recommend them, and easy to organize and access their offers and incentives. Value. You get fast, direct access to local businesses you trust, which makes their offers and incentives more valuable.\nThe Details</p>\n\n<p>LikeList is the place where people who know each other and think alike share lists of their favorite local businesses.</p>\n\n<p>People trust referrals from friends and family more than those from strangers.\nSometimes knowing who is making a recommendation is just as important as which businesses theyâ€™re recommending.\nLikeList helps you get more value from your trusted local businesses.</p>\n\n<p>By â€œlikingâ€ businesses, or putting them onto your TryList, you create a way for them to share special promotions, coupons or other deals with you.\nLikeListâ€™s local online services make us a natural champion of local communities and their economies.</p>\n\n<p>Locally owned businesses make stronger communities. $45 of every $100 spent with a local business stays in the community, vs. $13 of every dollar spent with a national chain.1\nSo, Whatâ€™s in it For You?</p>\n\n<p>What if you could get five recommendations for quality local auto mechanics from all of the people in your personal network, and at the same time see offers and coupons from them?</p>\n\n<p>What if you could plan a weekend trip to the North Shore of Lake Tahoe and, in one click, see which hotels, rental properties, snowmobile tours, restaurants and evening dance or blues places your friend or group of friends like and highly recommend?</p>\n\n<p>What if you could access the local knowledge of your friends, neighbors and acquaintances 24x7 for anything you might need near or far from home?</p>\n\n<p>LikeList saves you time, money and worry.</p>\n\n<p>1Small-Mart Revolution: How Local Businesses are Beating the Global Competition, Michael H.
