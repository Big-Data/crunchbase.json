Youâ€™ll watch and participate as the instructor demonstrates a coding technique, and then try it on your own. Lab assignments will integrate the materials and help you retain whatâ€™s taught.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0015/8900/158900v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0015/8900/158900v2-max-250x250.png"],[[425,121],"assets/images/resized/0015/8900/158900v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Lassoff","permalink":"mark-lassoff","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Production Manager","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Hernandez","permalink":"kevin-hernandez","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"27 Hartford Turnpike","address2":"Suite 206","zip_code":"06066","city":"Vernon","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0016/0263/160263v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0016/0263/160263v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,255],"assets/images/resized/0016/0263/160263v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
