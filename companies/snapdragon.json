By scanning the barcodes of consumer products, you unlock a comic book adventure sarcastically told by Snapdragon. Each comic book is prompted by the type of products you scan. </p>\n\n<p>By tracking what you consume, our app becomes a reinvented â€˜Loyalty Cardâ€™ for your favorite consumer products.  We want to get you free stuff, too. If you eat Pop Tarts everyday for breakfast, we want to make sure Kelloggâ€™s has a way to say â€˜thanksâ€™ and give you some free stuff.
