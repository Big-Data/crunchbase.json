For a period of time determined by the applicationâ€™s user, Cancerblock turns off all four cell phone radiation energy sourcesâ€”antenna, Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetoothâ€” limiting exposure to both the known and unknown side effects of extended cell phone use. With a default schedule of 15 minutes off and 1 minute on, Cancerblock can reduce radiation exposure by 9,408 minutes in one week or a total reduction of 93.33%! The application features a simple interface that allows users to customize the application to their schedule. Cancerblock can be purchased for $2.99, 10% of which will be donated to cancer research. Currently, Cancerblock llc is developing the application for the iPhone 3 and 4 operating systems.</p>\n\n<p>â€œThe most recent science â€“ while not conclusive â€“ raises serious issues about the cancer risk of cell phone use that must be addressed through further research.
