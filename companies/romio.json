Romio is an alternative to the blind clutter on Craigslistâ€™s and a local networking alternative for real people to balance â€œFacebookâ€, where everyone does â€œinfinitely interesting things, with great looking people, all the timeâ€. Whether you want to get the inside scoop about your neighborhood, find a reliable babysitter via her connections or just connect with people with similar interests, weâ€™ll can help. We also want to help ordinary people with skills earn cash by showcasing their services and reputation to their neighbors. Romio also wants to help micro vendors reveal their skills to their neighbors and make extra cash. The bulletin Board has a social real estate engine. Romio was built to help create actionable and meaningful local connections to benefit life around you</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/6773/116773v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/6773/116773v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/6773/116773v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/theromio","title":"www.twitter.com/romiotwitting"}]}
