We also try to see how we can be update with technologies and trying to see if incorporating the same would help our end users. Our Founder happened to browse numerous classifieds site for used laptops, so he browsed a lot of them but the problem came when he had to actually see the product which users had only posted images for. He asked the user to send him a video and confirmed on the laptop after seeing the video. The rest is simple decided that there was a serious void in the classifieds market without video so Adhysteria.com was born. Want users to come to our site to full fill that void they see in other sites</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/6697/26697v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/6697/26697v1-max-250x250.png"],[[341,113],"assets/images/resized/0002/6697/26697v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Video Classifieds","permalink":"video-classifieds-2","image":null},{"name":"Video Auctions","permalink":"video-auctions","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Ceo/ Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rajiv","last_name":"Unnikrishnan","permalink":"rajiv-unnikrishnan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[94,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0135/10135v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0135/10135v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[283,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0135/10135v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"imoondo.com (closed shop),","permalink":"imoondo-com-closed-shop","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"realpeoplerealstuff.com ","permalink":"realpeoplerealstuff-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0009/7697/97697v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0009/7697/97697v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,72],"assets/images/resized/0009/7697/97697v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":10000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Rajiv","last_name":"Unnikrishnan","permalink":"rajiv-unnikrishnan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[94,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0135/10135v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0135/10135v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[283,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0135/10135v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"310 , Balarma, Bandra","address2":"Kurla Complex, Bandra East","zip_code":"400051","city":"Mumbai","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/6646/26646v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,170],"assets/images/resized/0002/6646/26646v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,307],"assets/images/resized/0002/6646/26646v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/6647/26647v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6647/26647v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0002/6647/26647v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/6648/26648v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6648/26648v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0002/6648/26648v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/6649/26649v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6649/26649v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0002/6649/26649v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.hotteststartups.in/viewandvote.do?method=fetch&businessFn=viewandvote&startupId=33","title":"Tata Hottest Startups"},{"external_url":"http://herringresearch.com/eventspace/blgtrx_event_home/asia08/submitatop100.html","title":"Red Herring Asia 100 Startups"}]}
