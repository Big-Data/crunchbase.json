Searching any contact, calendar or any sales data is as fast as searching in web search engine. The search engine accepts queries as a simple text. Words may be phrases that are delimited by quotation marks (&#8220;) to find exact match. They may also be field terms such as firstname:john. Field terms can be combined to form more advanced search such as firstname:john lastname:doe to search contacts with first name john or last name doe. If the search result must  have the specified field term, a plus sign (+) prefix is added to the field term.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In addition to personal information, important dates can be stored in contact details. Personalized email can be sent to contact few days before the date. Or, email reminder about the dates can be sent to you. All is done automatically for you.</p>\n\n<p>Contact photos may also be added to the contact details. Important documents can also be attached to the contact details.</p>\n\n<p>Contacts can be attached to Leads or Opportunities. Contacts can also be included as participants in an event. Quotations use contacts&#8217; details to fill up the recipients&#8217; detail. You use the email address in the contact when you select recipients for your emails.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Calendar Management\nCalendar management includes event and task management. Scheduled events can be created either as a one-off event or recurring event. The recurring events can be scheduled as daily, weekly, monthly or yearly events.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Many types of event scheduling are provided for you to conveniently schedule your events or meetings. You can create a daily event that happens every x days or every weekday. Weekly event can happen at any day (or days) of the week for every x week. Monthly event can be set as &#8220;The day x of every y month&#8221;. Monthly event can also be set as &#8220;The (first, second, third, fourth, last) (day, weekday, weekend day, Sunday-Saturday) of every x month&#8221;. Yearly event can be set as &#8220;Every (January, February, &#8230;, December) x-th&#8221;. It can also be set as &#8220;The (first, second, third, fourth, last) (day, weekday, weekend day, Sunday-Saturday) of (January, February, &#8230;, December).</p>\n\n<p>For every scheduled event, you can set the starting date and how the schedule ends. The schedule can run continuously, i.e., no ending, run for x times, or it can end on certain date. You can also set an email reminder to be sent at certain point of time.</p>\n\n<p>You can invite participants from your contacts or users in your company to attend a meeting or an event. Email invitation will be sent automatically to all participant at set date and time. The participants will have the opportunity to indicate their attendance by clicking a URL link in the email they receive. The response is automatically captured and displayed for your convenience.</p>\n\n<p>In addition of viewing the events as a list, the list can be viewed in day view, working days view, week view, month view or year view.</p>\n\n<p>Events can be created as part of Leads or Opportunities. Documents related to an event can be easily attached to the event details.</p>\n\n<p>You can record your tasks and set the email reminder to be sent at certain point of time. The email reminder can be sent at some interval before or after the start date or the due date of the task. Or, it can be sent on a specific date. The email reminder can be sent for a number of times when necessary. Documents related to a task can be easily attached to the task details.</p>\n\n<p>Charts related to the tasks can be generated easily. The charts are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Aggregated number of days spent for all tasks for each task priority (low, normal, or high). The result is represented as bar chart or pie chart.\n* Aggregated number of days spent for all tasks for each task status (not started, in progress, completed, waiting for someone else, or deferred). The result is represented as bar chart or pie chart.\n* Number of tasks for each task status or priority.\n* Number of tasks for each task status or priority by month or by day. The result is represented in time series.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The charts are in PNG format that can be saved and embedded in document easily.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sales Management\nSales Lead can be created to initiate the sales process. Contacts can be added to a lead. If necessary, the role of the contact in the lead (contact person, decision maker, etc.) can be specified. You can then set its status (prospecting, qualified, or disqualified) and rating (hot, warm, or cold). The industry type of the lead and the source where the lead comes from can also be set.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Events such as meetings or appointments and tasks can be added to the lead. Documents and notes can also be included in the lead with ease.</p>\n\n<p>When the lead is qualified, the lead can be converted to opportunity. The opportunity will retain the contacts and their role in the lead.\nCharts to measure some of the lead&#8217;s attribute can be generated easily in PNG format. The charts are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Lead conversion by month.\n* Aggregated number of days spent for all leads for each lead status (prospecting, qualified, or disqualified). The result is represented as bar chart or pie chart.\n* Number of leads for each status, rating, industry type, or source. The result is represented as bar chart or pie chart.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In addition to lead list view, contacts in the lead can also be shown in the expanded list, making it easier to find the contacts for the lead.</p>\n\n<p>You can search the lead using any field of the lead. Searching can also be done to find contacts in the lead. For example, entering &#8220;decision maker&#8221; in the search phrase will find all contacts in the lead that have role as decision maker. It&#8217;s that easy.</p>\n\n<p>Sales process is captured in Opportunity. Sales stage can be set as the sales progresses. Each sales stage has a corresponding probability for winning the sales. The sales stages, with the probability in the bracket, are: Qualified (10%), Needs Assessment (20%), Solution Evaluation (30%), Proposal (50%), Purchasing Decision (70%), Refine Solution (80%), Verbal Agreement (90%), Purchase Order (100%), Lost (0%), Canceled (0%), and Suspended (0%). The probability of each stage can be set manually when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The expected revenue can be entered manually or it can be calculated automatically from the total price of the included products. The estimated revenue is calculated automatically by multiplying the expected revenue and the probability. The sales forecast can be made from the sum of estimated revenue from all opportunity. A chart can be generated to show the sales forecast over time.</p>\n\n<p>You can also set its rating (hot, warm, or cold) and the source where the opportunity comes from. These two properties are copied from the lead when the lead is converted to an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Products pricing can be set in the opportunity. It allows product discount, adding margin, or setting volume based pricing. Quotation can be generated at any point of time with the line items extracted from the included products.</p>\n\n<p>Events such as meetings or appointments, tasks, documents and notes can be added to the opportunity. This opportunity related information can easily be found and viewed in the opportunity details. In addition, company details about the suppliers, manufacturers, or even the competitors can be easily added to the opportunity details.</p>\n\n<p>Charts related to opportunity can be generated to get an overview of the sales process and its performance. Charts related to individual opportunity are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Expected and estimated revenue over time.\n* Sales stage Gantt Chart.\n* Working days or calendar days spent on each sales stage.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Charts related to all opportunities are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Aggregated number of days spent for all opportunities for each sales stage.\n* Number of opportunities for each source, rating, or sales stage. The result is represented as bar chart or pie chart.\n* Number of opportunities for each sales stage by month or by day. The result is represented in time series.\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Product Management\nProduct details accept pricing information such as unit price or cost, discount, margin, mark-up, or fixed price. In addition, it also allows volume-based pricing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If needed, product availability can be tracked by entering the stock number into product details. As products are added to opportunity, the availability will be reduced accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Pricing information can be locked such that users (sales personnel) can not change the product pricing. Otherwise, users can change the product discount, margin, mark-up or fixed price.</p>\n\n<p>Supplier and manufacturer of the product can also be entered into product details.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Auto Creation of Quotation\nQuotation can be easily generated any time from an opportunity. Quotation uses the products included in the opportunity as its line items. In addition to pricing information, line items also have some settings that controls the generated quotation. Line item can be set as an optional item or not visible in the generated quotation. Line item has also some adjustment such as extra charge (fixed amount or percentage of line item sub total), discount, or handling charge. The adjustment can be shown or made not visible in the generated quotation. Each line item&#8217;s delivery date can also be set if necessary.\nIn addition to product line items, comments, sub total or accumulated sub total can also be inserted into the quotation. Sub total or accumulated sub total will be calculated automatically.\nOther information in the quotation such as the recipient of the quotation, can be easily extracted from the data that is already available in the opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Quotation can be generated as PDF file with ease and it is automatically stored for future reference.</p>\n\n<p>The quotation format can be changed by editing its style-sheet. Changes can be made to individual quotation or to company quotation style-sheet.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Charts\nCharts are provided as bar chart, pie chart, Gantt chart or time series.
