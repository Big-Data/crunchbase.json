The patented technology can be integrated with existing EPoS, requires minimal integration and has a portfolio of impressive case studies to support consumer usage.</p>\n\n<p>To redeem a voucher, the consumer simply needs to enter a unique PIN via the retailerâ€™s Credit Card Terminal (Chip and PIN in the UK) and the value of the voucher is automatically delivered. This is supported by automated voucher processing and realtime reporting, thus replacing the need for paper vouchers and physical fulfilment in the retail value chain.</p>\n\n<p>Eagle Eye Solutionsâ€™ other services include retail gift cards, mobile payments and mobile based loyalty programmes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0013/9988/139988v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0013/9988/139988v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[289,66],"assets/images/resized/0013/9988/139988v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£1.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/eagle-eye-solutions-raises-1-5m-series-a-for-its-mobile-coupon-technology/","source_description":"Eagle Eye Solutions raises Â£1.5m Series A for its mobile coupon technology","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":20,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3rd Floor, City View Place","address2":"67 Sydenham Road, Guildford","zip_code":"GU1 3RY","city":"Surrey","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0014/0157/140157v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/0157/140157v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,361],"assets/images/resized/0014/0157/140157v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
