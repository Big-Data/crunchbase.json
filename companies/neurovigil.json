NeuroVigil&#8217;s patent-pending and proprietary technology provides for extremely rapid, automated, and accurate reading and interpretation of electroencephalogram data, which is a window to the functioning of the brain.</p>\n\n<p>The Company&#8217;s technology not only automates current manual tasks, but also more than quadruples the amount of useful information obtained from current EEG data, which may lead in the future to neural signatures, or correlates of important disease states, that will be useful in early detection and diagnosis of important medical conditions.</p>\n\n<p>NeuroVigil is the winner of the fourth annual  DFJ Venture Challenge, a business plan competition sponsored by Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ), DFJ Frontier, and Zone Ventures,  that awards $250,000 in seed funding to the winner.</p>\n\n<p>via: <a href=\"http://www.neurovigil.com\" title=\"NeuroVigil, Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow\">NeuroVigil, Inc.</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0001/9737/19737v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,138],"assets/images/resized/0001/9737/19737v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,248],"assets/images/resized/0001/9737/19737v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Chairman, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Low","permalink":"philip-low","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Systems Engineer","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Casterton","permalink":"david-casterton","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Software Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"McInerney","permalink":"jason-mcinerney","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$250k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/template.NDM/news/more/?javax.portlet.tpst=0b2c9a4dd5f89b80977dd367cc87b42f_ws_MX&javax.portlet.prp_0b2c9a4dd5f89b80977dd367cc87b42f_viewID=news_view_popup&javax.portlet.prp_0b2c9a4dd5f89b80977dd367cc87b42f_new","source_description":" Draper Fisher Jurvetson, DFJ Frontier, and Zone Ventures Award $250,000 to NeuroVigil in Fourth Annual DFJ Venture Challenge","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":30,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ)","permalink":"draper-fisher-jurvetson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Zone Ventures","permalink":"zone-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0001/8869/18869v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0001/8869/18869v1-max-250x250.png"],[[318,144],"assets/images/resized/0001/8869/18869v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"DFJ Frontier","permalink":"dfj-frontier","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/9359/19359v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/9359/19359v1-max-250x250.png"],[[305,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/9359/19359v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/05/neurovigil-closes-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"NeuroVigil Closes First Financing Round","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":3,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"92037","city":"La Jolla","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":32.847521,"longitude":-117.274609}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
