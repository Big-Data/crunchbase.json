No more straps sliding off your shoulder. No more fumbling around, wasting time, or neckaches. Like a few of historyâ€™s most inspired inventions (the wheel, pre-grated cheese, the bug zapper, etc.), the concept is so simple it evaded everyoneâ€¦ until now. Your camera hangs upside down, ready to maneuver into position at a momentâ€™s notice via a sliding ConnectR that allows the camera to move freely while the strap stays put. Like a true revolutionary, Ron shared the wealth (so to speak) and started Black Rapid Inc. to ease the pains of the people.
