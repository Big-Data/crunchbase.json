These products include a mobile application, web application, and an in-gym fitness application.  Regardless of the exercise, Fit for Green tracks it in terms of power generated by the user.  For example; that person just did a 600 watt-hour spin class.  </p>\n\n<p>By measuring power weâ€™re able to put everything in terms of real work completed.  Power is easier to understand because we can relate it to everyday things like how much energy your house consumes or how much energy it takes to keep a light on.  </p>\n\n<p>Besides the fact that power is a pure unit of work, it is also a good metric to gamify.  We have east coast people trying to power the Empire State building before west coast people power the Golden Gate Bridge or we put Democrats against Republicans to see who can make enough power to light the Whitehouse first.  </p>\n\n<p>For these games your power generated become points that can be applied towards the contests which provide additional incentives and make it fun for people to be more active.  Depending on the contest there may also be rewards for top contributors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0022/3690/223690v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0022/3690/223690v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,222],"assets/images/resized/0022/3690/223690v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Spirko","permalink":"john-spirko","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/9061/209061v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/9061/209061v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/9061/209061v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Alma","last_name":"Spirko","permalink":"alma-spirko","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Khamseh","permalink":"adam-khamseh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Meehan","permalink":"michael-meehan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[87,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/4412/24412v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[87,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/4412/24412v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[87,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/4412/24412v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"DIrector of Public Relations","person":{"first_name":"Candice","last_name":"DeForest","permalink":"candice-deforest","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Brook","last_name":"Cross","permalink":"brook-cross","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"28492 Casanal","address2":"","zip_code":"92692","city":"Mission Viejo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0022/3691/223691v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0022/3691/223691v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0022/3691/223691v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
