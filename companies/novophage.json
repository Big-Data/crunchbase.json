Biofilms, slimy communities of bacteria, prevent heat transfer, cause massive corrosion, biofouling and diseases, while costing the US economy in the double-digit billion dollar figures. Current approaches to combat these persistent problems are either toxic, corrosive and/or environmentally damaging. Novophage is developing a first-in-class anti-biofilm solution that is green and highly effective against biofilms.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0013/7253/137253v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0013/7253/137253v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,85],"assets/images/resized/0013/7253/137253v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Micah","last_name":"Rosenbloom","permalink":"micah-rosenbloom-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and COO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Koeris","permalink":"michael-koeris","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5.75M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/05/30/daily13-Novophage-nabs-575M-funding-names-Rosenbloom-as-CEO.html","source_description":"Novophage nabs $5.75M funding, names Rosenbloom as CEO","raised_amount":5750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":31,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"has taken in $5.75 million in its first institutional funding round","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":31,"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/05/30/daily13-Novophage-nabs-575M-funding-names-Rosenbloom-as-CEO.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Novophage nabs $5.75M funding, names Rosenbloom as CEO","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Novophage","permalink":"novophage"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
