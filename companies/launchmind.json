It aims to establish a new route for university students to gain graduate employment.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, LaunchMind is reversing the recruitment process, so that graduates are contacted by employers who think they are a good match. Also, unlike other services, they&#8217;ve made it free for employers to search their database and view CVs, thus encouraging more employers to get involved, and ultimately, start contacting graduates.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0003/6275/36275v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,247],"assets/images/resized/0003/6275/36275v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[258,255],"assets/images/resized/0003/6275/36275v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Apex House","address2":"2 Sylvester Road","zip_code":"E8 1EP","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.6214201,"longitude":-0.2547278}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
