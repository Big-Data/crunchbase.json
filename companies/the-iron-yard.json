You’ll find everyone from designers, hackers and teachers to makers, artists, and writers. We love building businesses and projects, and our fuel is the people who bring those things to life. </p>\n\n<p>Here ‘accelerate’ means so much more than trendy technology and giant buy-outs. We’re interested in building strong, sustainable businesses that add value to customer’s lives. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking the same language? We’d love for you to join us. Whether your goal is a Series A round, building a team and bootstrapping, or utilizing Kickstarter, we have a place for you. </p>\n\n<p>What makes us different, you ask? It’s a secret sauce with two ingredients. </p>\n\n<p>The first is our network of mentors. CEOs and investors are must-haves, but they’re not the only ingredients to success. We partner with specialists in marketing, design, community management, and other disciplines to offer truly well-rounded support.  </p>\n\n<p>The second is The Iron Yard community. Along with supportive alumni (in the same town), our program is located in a space that provides coworking for all sorts of professionals, intensive code education, and hosts nationally-known technology and design events. Did we mention that the best coffee shop on the east coast is in our office? </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Barth","permalink":"peter-barth","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/2248/122248v4-max-150x150.png"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0012/2248/122248v4-max-250x250.png"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0012/2248/122248v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Program Manager","person":{"first_name":"Kate","last_name":"McCarthy","permalink":"kate-mccarthy-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Evangelist","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Waldschmidt","permalink":"dan-waldschmidt","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6520/96520v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6520/96520v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[301,351],"assets/images/resized/0009/6520/96520v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Program Manager","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Dodds","permalink":"eric-dodds","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Director and UX Wizard","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"matthew-smith","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"The Forge","address1":"411 University","address2":"Suite 220","zip_code":"29601","city":"Greenville","state_code":"SC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Railside","address1":"1040 West Washington Street","address2":"","zip_code":"29601","city":"Greenville","state_code":"SC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://vimeo.com/46039271","title":"Why Greenville, SC?"}]}
