This includes medical images, email, business documents, video images, research data, and digital media of all types. The company&#8217;s solutions enable organizations to store and access growing amounts of fixed content over longer periods of time, while meeting evolving business and compliance requirements in a &#8220;green&#8221; environment.</p>\n\n<p>Nexsan is recognized as a pioneer of reliable disk-based storage technologies optimized for capacity, energy efficiency and cost. Through its adoption and refinement of RAID, ATA and SATA disk technologies coupled with innovations in de-duplication, secure archiving software, and storage encryption, Nexsan&#8217;s products have dramatically reshaped the economics of disk-based storage. Nexsan now offers enterprise-class storage at price points up to 1/10th the cost of traditional disk-based storage solutions. The company&#8217;s products offer AutoMAID (Automatic Massive Array of Idle Disks), a policy-based intelligent &#8220;green&#8221; energy saving technology. AutoMAID epitomizes the MAID 2.0 concept in which power consumption is dramatically reduced without sacrificing performance.</p>\n\n<p>Since its founding in 1999, Nexsan has sold its products exclusively through a select, global network of VARs, OEMs, and system integrators and have deployed over 21, 000 systems worldwide to more than 60 countries. Nexsan has installed its systems in small and medium-sized enterprises as well as large global enterprises around the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0003/4692/34692v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0003/4692/34692v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[253,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/4692/34692v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SATABoy","permalink":"sataboy","image":null},{"name":"SATABeast","permalink":"satabeast","image":null},{"name":"SASBoy","permalink":"sasboy","image":null},{"name":"SASBeast","permalink":"sasbeast","image":null},{"name":"Assureon","permalink":"assureon","image":null},{"name":"The Edge","permalink":"the-edge","image":null},{"name":"SATABeast Xi","permalink":"satabeast-xi","image":null},{"name":"AutoMAID","permalink":"automaid","image":null},{"name":"DATABeast","permalink":"databeast","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Nexsan Canada","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Gosnell","permalink":"thomas-gosnell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Eugene","last_name":"Spies","permalink":"eugene-spies","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Mussman","permalink":"richard-mussman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer & Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Black","permalink":"philip-black","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President of Sales","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Molenda","permalink":"james-molenda","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Commercial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"McGuire","permalink":"michael-mcguire","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Watson","permalink":"gary-watson-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Gregg","last_name":"Pugmire","permalink":"gregg-pugmire","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Woolery","permalink":"robert-woolery","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Financial Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Zachary","last_name":"Friedman","permalink":"zachary-friedman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/3210/143210v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0014/3210/143210v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0014/3210/143210v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Copan Systems","permalink":"copan-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,46],"assets/images/resized/0005/0533/50533v1-max-150x150.png"],[[138,46],"assets/images/resized/0005/0533/50533v1-max-250x250.png"],[[138,46],"assets/images/resized/0005/0533/50533v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"EMC","permalink":"emc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/1658/21658v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/1658/21658v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,270],"assets/images/resized/0002/1658/21658v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","permalink":"hewlett-packard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[242,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[291,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$7.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.crn.com/storage/199100745;jsessionid=0GN5E1MJ0S4EDQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN","source_description":"Nexsan Revs Up $7.5M Channel Push","raised_amount":7500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Fonds de solidaritÃ© FTQ","permalink":"fonds-de-solidarit-ftq","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0006/1164/61164v1-max-150x150.png"],[[177,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/1164/61164v1-max-250x250.png"],[[177,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/1164/61164v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"555 St. Charles Drive","address2":"Suite 202","zip_code":"91360 ","city":"Thousand Oaks","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.185043,"longitude":-118.878852},{"description":"Canada -
