Whether it&#8217;s at home, at work &#8211; in front of the tv or computer &#8211; on the road or in the theater, LoveCinema is the world&#8217;s first social movie hub that you can take with you.</p>\n\n<p>Where most mass media institutions from yesterday&#8217;s supermarket tabloids to today&#8217;s blogs and widgets focus on distributing movie information to fans of film, LoveCinema invites and enables these same fans to create their own more relevant distribution channels through clubs and the interaction that happens around them. </p>\n\n<p>They can do this from the laptops, desktops, iPhones, Facebook pages or offline friends networks.</p>\n\n<p>LoveCinema believes strongly in the power of people gathering around movies and those who make them. One person loving a movie is beautiful but 2 or more friends experiencing that passion together is profound; LoveCinema seeks to channel this unharnessed energy and to grow it exponentially through a community that taps one simple truth: </p>\n\n<p>People need to share in their love of movies and movie stars. People love to love cinema.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0005/5293/55293v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,117],"assets/images/resized/0005/5293/55293v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[157,117],"assets/images/resized/0005/5293/55293v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member/Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brett","last_name":"Walsh","permalink":"brett-walsh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Melucci","permalink":"matthew-melucci","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Monge","permalink":"roberto-monge","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP/Community Strategy","person":{"first_name":"Coulson","last_name":"Deurksen","permalink":"coulson-deurksen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member/Co-Foudner","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Walsh","permalink":"sean-walsh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member/Secretary","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Craig","permalink":"james-craig","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Flixster","permalink":"flixster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/1013/11013v17-max-150x150.png"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0001/1013/11013v17-max-250x250.png"],[[316,193],"assets/images/resized/0001/1013/11013v17-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MovieMobz","permalink":"moviemobz","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0005/5221/55221v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,120],"assets/images/resized/0005/5221/55221v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,216],"assets/images/resized/0005/5221/55221v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0005/5222/55222v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0005/5222/55222v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,238],"assets/images/resized/0005/5222/55222v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://apps.facebook.com/lovecinema/","title":"Celebrity Friends by LoveCinema"},{"external_url":"http://business.lovecinema.com/welcome/","title":"LoveCinema Business Site"}]}
