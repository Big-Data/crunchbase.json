The idea came from Mark&#8217;s frustration with seeing too many companies receive funding from Northern California VCs and then choosing to relocate their teams. The Launchpad LA initiative is a true collaboration among the area&#8217;s best VCs who have a shared interest in seeing a robust tech community continue to grow and thrive in Los Angeles.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0008/7507/87507v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,32],"assets/images/resized/0008/7507/87507v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,58],"assets/images/resized/0008/7507/87507v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Suster","permalink":"mark-suster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/5986/45986v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0004/5986/45986v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0004/5986/45986v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>GRP Partners</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Lilling","permalink":"adam-lilling","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Teller","permalink":"sam-teller","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/6060/166060v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/6060/166060v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[290,290],"assets/images/resized/0016/6060/166060v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Roth","permalink":"joshua-roth","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3196/103196v2-max-150x150.png"],[[228,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3196/103196v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,274],"assets/images/resized/0010/3196/103196v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/launchpad-la-receives-vc-funding-50000-per-startup/","source_description":"Launchpad LA Receives VC Funding: $50,000 Per Startup","raised_amount":1300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":8,"investments":[]}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/lettuce-2-1-million/","source_description":"Order Management Startup Lettuce Raises $2.1 Million From Crosscut Ventures, 500 Startups, And Others","raised_amount":2100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Lettuce","permalink":"lettuce","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,30],"assets/images/resized/0021/5573/215573v1-max-150x150.png"],[[144,30],"assets/images/resized/0021/5573/215573v1-max-250x250.png"],[[144,30],"assets/images/resized/0021/5573/215573v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://gigaom.com/2012/10/24/tradesy-raises-1-5-million-series-a-to-kill-clothing-resale-competition/","source_description":"Tradesy raises $1.5 million Series A to kill clothing resale competition","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"Tradesy","permalink":"tradesy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0021/7022/217022v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,64],"assets/images/resized/0021/7022/217022v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,64],"assets/images/resized/0021/7022/217022v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/backed-by-2-million-in-funding-from-learn-capital-kapor-500-startups-bruno-mars-others-chromatiks-digital-music-platform-goes-live/","source_description":"Backed By $2 Million In Funding From Learn Capital, Kapor, 500 Startups, Bruno Mars & Others, Chromatikâ€™s Digital Music Platform Goes Live","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"Chromatik","permalink":"chromatik","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/7472/167472v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/7472/167472v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/7472/167472v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
