If you sign up on the site you get access to your personalized library with the songs you love and a playlist section in which you can create your own mix. </p>\n\n<p>Via your dashboard you can even see others Stereomood users that are in the same mood and you can check out their profile. quickly share your own tracks on twitter and last.fm via the profile page.</p>\n\n<p>Stereomood gathers songs to add to its database by allowing users to add songs as well as aggregating from popular music blogs (similar to how The Hype Machine operates). It then allows users to tag the songs with mood tags or activity tags, to help sort them and add them to the correct playlists.</p>\n\n<p>Stereomood took a concept that many people already use (making playlists based on mood) and brought it into the digital age by combining it with newer concepts, like the third order of order and the wisdom of the crowd. Now users can tag songs with moods and emotions so that they can be organized in that manner, and thus, playlists can be generated automatically.
