Each year, up to $24 billion dollars in waste can be attributed to repeated MRI and other advanced imaging scans, miscommunication, and other errors </p>\n\n<p>The Radiology Protocols team is tackling the problem of inefficiency and waste in the medical imaging industry by offering a customizable, scalable platform that provides centralized management and storage of imaging protocols among hospitals, medical groups, private practices, and health networks. Instead of manually updating protocols, creating copies, and distributing them to the imaging technicians, protocols can be created or updated on the fly and pushed from the cloud straight to the technicians work space immediately. This centralized management of imaging protocols will ensure technicians follow the appropriate procedures to produce high quality images the first time around, providing radiologists with the critical information they need to correctly diagnose patients and at the same time eliminating waste from rerunning tests to get accurate results. The core features of the Radiology Protocols application include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complete Radiology Protocols Library 2.0 for the entire human body that includes detailed instructions for technicians.</li>\n<li>Built in contrast drug dosage and unit conversion calculators to ensure correct contrast dosing for optimal test images</li>\n<li>Screening form designer &amp; library to keep patients informed and safe during the testing process</li>\n<li>Scalable SaaS architecture to meet the needs of various health organizations and providers with advanced enterprise, facility, and organization permissions.</li>\n<li>An intuitive Protocol &amp; Image Builder for customizing specifications and creating unique protocol databases tailored to an institutions specific needs.</li>\n<li>Currently available in 3 different languages, with more being added in the future.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,45],"assets/images/resized/0014/1000/141000v4-max-150x150.png"],[[144,45],"assets/images/resized/0014/1000/141000v4-max-250x250.png"],[[144,45],"assets/images/resized/0014/1000/141000v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Baker","permalink":"stephen-baker-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1221/141221v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,157],"assets/images/resized/0014/1221/141221v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,157],"assets/images/resized/0014/1221/141221v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Cramer","permalink":"josh-cramer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/4367/154367v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/4367/154367v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/4367/154367v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Essig","permalink":"marco-essig","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1472/141472v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,157],"assets/images/resized/0014/1472/141472v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,157],"assets/images/resized/0014/1472/141472v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"European Marketing Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Kalla","permalink":"peter-kalla","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Strategic Business Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Colbert","permalink":"andy-colbert","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Technical Development","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cramer Development","permalink":"cramer-development","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Office","address1":"927 Duck Creek Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"52246","city":"Iowa City","state_code":"IA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0014/0997/140997v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,179],"assets/images/resized/0014/0997/140997v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,323],"assets/images/resized/0014/0997/140997v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0014/0998/140998v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0014/0998/140998v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,321],"assets/images/resized/0014/0998/140998v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0014/0999/140999v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0014/0999/140999v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,321],"assets/images/resized/0014/0999/140999v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
