Dry powder and nebulizer-based medicines are formulated directly from active drug ingredients, requiring no carrier particles and little or no excipients. The aerodynamics of NanoCluster formulations are fully customizable from one to seven microns enabling high drug concentrations at specific regions of the lung, independent of the rate or depth of breath. Savara expects that NanoClusterâ€™s unique features will produce numerous patient benefits including reduced dosage, enhanced efficacy, improved safety and increased tolerability, as well as greater patient convenience. Savaraâ€™s NanoCluster technology is currently available for evaluation and licensing. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/3549/63549v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[246,79],"assets/images/resized/0006/3549/63549v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[246,79],"assets/images/resized/0006/3549/63549v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Curt","last_name":"Bilby","permalink":"curt-bilby","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Nevan","last_name":"Elam","permalink":"nevan-elam","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Dennis","permalink":"matt-dennis","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/savara-pharmaceuticals-inc-series-a-10m/","source_description":"Savara Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Series A $1.0M","raised_amount":833000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":6,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1461492/000146149209000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEc D","raised_amount":645000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/06/savara-pharmaceuticals-raises-8-6m-closing-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Savara Pharmaceuticals Raises $8.6M in First Closing of Series B Funding","raised_amount":8600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":12,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3925 West Braker Lane","address2":"","zip_code":"78759","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/3550/63550v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0006/3550/63550v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,368],"assets/images/resized/0006/3550/63550v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
