I currently live in Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 8 years I’ve been intensely focused on building a real web business with actual traffic and revenue. Real visitors. Real revenue. As you are well aware, there is a lot of talk about traffic on the web, however, a majority of people aren’t able to actually get traffic and revenue for a site.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years we have been blessed to see our site DenimBlog.com get an incredible amount of traffic and revenue. Over 4.3 million visitors and 16.7 million pageviews a year. Our focus on creating excellent content has enabled us to bring in millions of people to our site.</p>\n\n<p>My team and I are putting together a brand new startup called http://www.Tugboat.io . We are creating a simple, clean site overflowing with some of the most important and useful information on the web that you can use to grow your web traffic and your business.</p>\n\n<p>No fluff, no clutter, just solid information you can actually use.</p>\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t tell you everything right now, but we would love to have you join us as we slowly pull back the curtain and begin to share some of the exciting things we are working on.</p>\n\n<p>Please check out our site and enter your email to become one of our supporters and early adopters.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out my company!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/0946/210946v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/0946/210946v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0021/0946/210946v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0021/0945/210945v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0021/0945/210945v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0021/0945/210945v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuSXubzctsI","title":"Tugboat.io"}]}
