We are in the business of research and development of pharmaceutical products utilizing our validated drug delivery platform technology. We have U.S. and international patents and other proprietary rights to technology that facilitates the absorption of drugs. Our platform drug delivery technology enhances permeation and absorption of pharmaceutical molecules across the skin, nasal mucosa and eye through development of proprietary formulations with molecules such as CPE-215Â®. Our first product is TestimÂ®, a gel for testosterone replacement therapy, which is a formulation of our technology with testosterone. Testim is licensed to Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
