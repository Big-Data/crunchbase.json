Tokutekâ€™s solution is based on a revolutionary new Fractal Treeâ„¢ technology. The Tokutek solution plugs into the back-end of any database, allowing operating practices to continue without change while the performance of the system improves dramatically.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0009/8738/98738v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/8738/98738v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/8738/98738v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"MartÃ­n","last_name":"Farach-Colton","permalink":"martn-farach-colton","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Partridge","permalink":"john-partridge","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Vice President of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"A.
