Recently, CMS introduced a suite of backup solutions designed for small business owners. Built to minimize the effect of down-time on small and medium businesses, the BounceBackâ„¢ Instant Server Recovery solutions are powerful tools to ensure business continuity during server hard drive failures, or catastrophic data loss. The BounceBack Instant Server Recovery Solution consists of a two-drive desktop storage device with support for RAID 0 &amp;1 technology available in 2TB or 4TB capacities. The stylish enclosure includes easily removable hard drives, which facilitate offsite archiving of important business data. The BounceBack Server solution enables business users in small server environments like doctors offices, storefronts or accountants to restart their business server following a hard drive failure and run the server directly from the backup system. This facilitates immediate time-to-productivity, keeping the business user up and running until a time of their choosing when they can perform a full recovery from backup onto a replacement internal server hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>CMS Products makes its technology available through Enterprise, Government Agency and Educational Institutions, as well as SOHO, and consumers through national and international distributors and resellers.</p>\n\n<p>Subscribe to our Bits n Bytes blog for the latest news and updates from CMS Products. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0009/9819/99819v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,84],"assets/images/resized/0009/9819/99819v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,84],"assets/images/resized/0009/9819/99819v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Burke","permalink":"ken-burke","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Acronis","permalink":"acronis","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/0504/20504v1-max-150x150.png"],[[103,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/0504/20504v1-max-250x250.png"],[[103,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/0504/20504v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Carbonite","permalink":"carbonite","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mozy","permalink":"mozy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/0982/982v1-max-150x150.png"],[[206,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/0982/982v1-max-250x250.png"],[[206,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/0982/982v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Clickfree","permalink":"clickfree","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0004/3196/43196v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[233,80],"assets/images/resized/0004/3196/43196v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[233,80],"assets/images/resized/0004/3196/43196v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Iomega","permalink":"iomega","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/7189/17189v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/7189/17189v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/7189/17189v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"LaCie","permalink":"lacie","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/8711/38711v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/8711/38711v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/8711/38711v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"286\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/k1N94CUnlxg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6&amp;border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/k1N94CUnlxg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6&amp;border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"450\" height=\"286\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>CSM Small Business Server Backup Solutions</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0009/9818/99818v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,168],"assets/images/resized/0009/9818/99818v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,168],"assets/images/resized/0009/9818/99818v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
