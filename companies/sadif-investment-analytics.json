You will find our ratings delivered through a set of investment tools for risk management and stock picking. The methodology of the ratings is based on Warren Buffett&#8217;s evaluation of his first 25 years in the stock market. According to his philosophy, good companies are those with: a good business, good management and a fair price. The StockMarksâ„¢ quality cubes combine these factors in a multi-dimensional analysis to determine a companyâ€™s investment attractiveness on a scale of 0 to 100.Visit www.sadif.analytics for a full explaination of the StockMarks methodology. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Risk Grades","permalink":"risk-grades","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Stockscouter","permalink":"stockscouter","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Zacks","permalink":"zacks","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
