UC &amp; C is projected to become an $87B market by 2014 and the UC &amp; C as a Cloud Service market to be a $5.6B by 2014. RedShift estimates that the total addressable market for UC &amp; C Security is projected to be $1.7B by 2014. Attacks have increase exponentially since the recent financial meltdown in 2008 - UK MPâ€™s/Royals voicemail hacked, $40B lost in fraud calls, Botnet attacks on Amazon EC2 &amp; Voice Phishing attacks. </p>\n\n<p>Todayâ€™s legacy security solutions like firewalls, IPS/IDS and SBCâ€™s arenâ€™t suited to handle these new attacks, hence a new paradigm of security threats and product. RedShift manufacturers a family of UCTM appliances (virtual) for large, medium, and branch offices, for enterprises and carriers.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
