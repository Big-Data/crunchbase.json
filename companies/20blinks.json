Like seeing the world through someone elseâ€™s eyes. \nA new concept of ranking todayâ€™s assets based on personal flavour, style and taste. </p>\n\n<p>Not like algorithm or a thesaurus based search engines.</p>\n\n<p>20blinks is a free service connecting people with ALL of their favourite digital assets (videos, books, movies, songs, sounds, pictures, places, URL&#8217;s). 20blinks is content ranking based on individual, personal preference. When you want to experience something, you simply visit the 20blinks page of the whizz you happen to know.</p>\n\n<p>You donâ€™t need to browse a large number of sites; simply visit the 20blinks page of someone you know. See the world through his eyes and get inspired by his style/personality. With 20blinks you can look into other peoples life and connect with people who share the same style. Besides, while you build your own 20blinks collections, 20blinks helps you to express yourself, get inspired by others and create a rich personal web identity (MyPage). It is like featuring your lifestyle and explore the life(-style) of others.</p>\n\n<p>How was the idea born.\nLife goes by in a blink of the eye. We simply missed the functionality of having one online place to collect and share your personal &amp; favourite digital stuff. Why search everything on all sites? Experience what someone you know likes most.</p>\n\n<p>How does it work.\nYou can build up to 20 collections (any topic) of 20 favourite items by adding content that pulls information from a variety of sources, like YouTube, Vimeo, Movies.org, Soundcloud, Amazon, Last FM, your Facebook pictures and videos, any URL, any picture from your disk. Basically we can add up any format/source.</p>\n\n<p>About us.\n20blinks.com is developed by 20BLINKS bv, a Dutch inc. founded a year ago. It is privately owned by us, funded by angels (350k), run out of Amsterdam by team of 5 free lance nutters with co-ownership. BasZ is the obsessed mind behind the concept, design &amp; functionality. Sandra Hay is ehh.. just obsessed!</p>\n\n<p>We ARE disruptive.\nWhy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Subjective ranking of digital assets. Thatâ€™s what we call it. Content linked and ranked based on subjectivity. As far as we know, a function like that simply doesnâ€™t exist and will turn the world of algorithm/thesaurus based search upside down.</li>\n<li>We focus on what means most to someone; curation &amp; limitation (not like a.o. Facebook, Flickr ; all your stuff). You can store all your stuff on many places/patforms, but your identity is based on display/share of what you pick.</li>\n<li>Our focus is on visual and design to express yourself (not like a.o. Facebook; text). Images, images, images.</li>\n<li>We believe all main formats/sources should be supported in one environment (not like a.o. your Youtube channel; just videos)</li>\n</ol>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0013/3845/133845v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0013/3845/133845v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,111],"assets/images/resized/0013/3845/133845v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u06yfDaztnU&feature=related","description":"<p>TechCrunch Product Vid</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/5439/135439v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0013/5439/135439v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0013/5439/135439v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/5440/135440v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0013/5440/135440v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0013/5440/135440v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/5441/135441v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0013/5441/135441v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0013/5441/135441v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
