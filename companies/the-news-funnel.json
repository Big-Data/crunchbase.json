News Funnel subscribers create a customized news feed for their geographic market, industry segment and areas of interest that is accessed on their personalized home page or via a daily email. Businesses in the real estate industry, or those that serve the real estate industry, can distribute press releases, blogs, market research reports and event info to subscribers&#8217; funnels. Since The News Funnel focuses only on the real estate industry, its search feature eliminates all non-real estate related news.</p>\n\n<p>During registration, subscribers can customize their funnel by geographic market, industry segment, keywords and areas of interest. Additionally, users of The News Funnel can follow news from specific companies. These preferences are stored in users’ profiles and are used to filter the news delivered to their funnel. Users can modify their custom news settings at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Each morning, subscribers receive an email alert that features several stories reflective of their customized news funnel settings. This email links to the featured stories and also to the user&#8217;s complete News Funnel on www.thenewsfunnel.com. Users can also bookmark their customized funnel. News feeds are updated in real time, so a user&#8217;s News Funnel is updated throughout the day with fresh content.</p>\n\n<p>The News Funnel offers Company News Channels (CNC) — a webpage that provides a profile of a company. CNC&#8217;s are available, at no charge, to companies in the real estate business or to businesses who serve the real estate vertical.  Press releases, event notifications, blogs and market research reports can be uploaded to the CNC, and are then distributed into the funnels of subscribers. </p>\n\n<p>The News Funnel features simple and advanced search capabilities. Aggregated content is stored for six months and users can search this content by keyword, market, industry segment or area of interest. Search results are narrower than mainstream search engines since TNF only sources real estate stories from major media and trade publications.</p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in New York City, The News Funnel was founded in 2011 by Michael Beckerman, a 25-year veteran of the public relations and media industries, and the founder and chairman of Beckerman, an independently owned, full-service public relations agency.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0018/3991/183991v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0018/3991/183991v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,241],"assets/images/resized/0018/3991/183991v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Beckerman","permalink":"michael-beckerman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/686144/the-news-funnel-raises-1m-curated-business-news-website","source_description":"The News Funnel Raises $1M for Curated Business News Website","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":9,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"424 W. 33rd Street","address2":"Suite 270","zip_code":"10001","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9ezYX1-EhA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>The News Funnel</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0018/6038/186038v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0018/6038/186038v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,368],"assets/images/resized/0018/6038/186038v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0018/6039/186039v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,183],"assets/images/resized/0018/6039/186039v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,330],"assets/images/resized/0018/6039/186039v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0018/6040/186040v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0018/6040/186040v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,321],"assets/images/resized/0018/6040/186040v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0018/6041/186041v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,203],"assets/images/resized/0018/6041/186041v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,366],"assets/images/resized/0018/6041/186041v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
