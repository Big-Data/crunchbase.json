Karyopharm Therapeutics is developing small molecule drugs that will modulate the activity of critical pathways in cancer, inflammation, and cell proliferation (e.g. FOXO, NFÐºB, P53, pRB) by targeting the nuclear pore complex machinery, which controls the import and export of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm. To successfully control transport through the nuclear pore complex, the company will use its unique technology platform, developed by Sharon Shacham, to identify novel small molecules, optimize them into clinical candidates, and to evaluate them in subsequent human clinical studies. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0010/8626/108626v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0010/8626/108626v1-max-250x250.png"],[[338,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/8626/108626v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Kauffman","permalink":"michael-kauffman-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[72,88],"assets/images/resized/0011/7600/117600v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[72,88],"assets/images/resized/0011/7600/117600v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[72,88],"assets/images/resized/0011/7600/117600v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$30M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2010/11/karyopharm-therapeutics-completes-20m.html","source_description":"Karyopharm Therapeutics Completes $20M Series A Financing","raised_amount":20000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":3,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/10/31/daily31-Karyopharm-collects-10M-more-in-Series-A-round.html","source_description":"Karyopharm collects $10M more in Series A round","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":2,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"received $1 million research award from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":7,"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/01/03/daily63-Three-Mass-biotechs-get-1M-from-myeloma-foundation.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Three Mass. biotechs get $1M from myeloma foundation","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Karyopharm Therapeutics","permalink":"karyopharm-therapeutics"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
