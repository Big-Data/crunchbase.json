In response, they created a standards-compliant MTA that eliminated racks of email servers running general purpose versions, thus reducing operating overhead. They put traditional thinking aside and established partnerships with integrators and software companies, anti-virus, anti-spam and reputation services to offer end-to-end email solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Its <a href=\"/product/deliverymanager-mta\" title=\"Momentum Platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">Momentum Platform</a> is used by companies such as <a href=\"/company/facebook\"
