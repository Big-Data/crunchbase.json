Among the Companyâ€™s technologies under development are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MotionPowerâ„¢  roadway systems for generating electricity by capturing the kinetic energy produced by moving vehicles. An estimated 250 million registered vehicles drive more than 6 billion miles on Americaâ€™s roadways, every day; and</li>\n<li>SolarWindowâ„¢  technologies which enable transparent glass windows to generate electricity by coating their glass surfaces with the worldâ€™s smallest known solar cells. These solar coatings are less than 1/10th the thickness of â€˜thinâ€™ films and make use of the worldâ€™s smallest functional solar cells, shown to successfully produce electricity in a recently published peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy of the American Institute of Physics.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0009/9673/99673v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0009/9673/99673v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[273,94],"assets/images/resized/0009/9673/99673v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO ","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"A.
