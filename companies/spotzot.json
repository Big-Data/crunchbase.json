Spotzot’s dynamically generated, precision-targeted SpotAds connect with consumers at the most active stage in the purchase funnel through leading mobile shopping, search, and location-aware applications and web sites. </p>\n\n<p>ADVERTISERS  \nSpotAds provide two ways for advertisers to target shoppers:   </p>\n\n<p>Exclusive SpotAds provide a dedicated brand experience for retailers and e-tailers that want to promote their offers free of competing ads. Exclusive SpotAds dynamically convert the most relevant regularly priced and discounted promotional merchandise into compelling catalogs of offers grouped by category and price that match each shopper’s interest and location.   Non-exclusive SpotAds enable retailers, e-tailers and product brands to display their sponsored performance and impression-based ads among other results that match the shopper’s interest.   </p>\n\n<p>PUBLISHERS  \nMonetize your app or web site with Spotzot’s SpotAds.
