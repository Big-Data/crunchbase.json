DAS networks by ExteNet Systems are implemented by wireless service providers in a variety of locations and environments. </p>\n\n<p>ExteNet is technologically adaptable â€“ which means they can operate CDMA, GSM, UMTS, 3G and 4G within each fiber network that we deploy. They are adept at designing, implementing and operating fiber networks to extend their networkâ€™s traditional sites into hard-to-zone areas, or to places where you do not have coverage. Their fiber networks could also be a reasonable backhaul solution for wireless service providers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0004/3440/43440v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0004/3440/43440v1-max-250x250.png"],[[268,102],"assets/images/resized/0004/3440/43440v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ross","last_name":"W.
