But they havenâ€™t been able to justify big investments in word of mouth, because it lacks scalability, repeatability, measurability, and brand safety.</p>\n\n<p>The Dynamic Signal technology and services enable brands to:</p>\n\n<p>1.) Identify and evaluate category influencers\n2.) Bring influencers into a long-term alliance with the brand\n3.) Use an app-based approach to run brand advocacy campaigns and distribute viral content\n4.) Measure these campaigns and content in the context of the brandâ€™s entire marketing mix</p>\n\n<p>The Dynamic Signal platform is the operating system to make word of mouth marketing a key part of the marketing mix.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0011/2631/112631v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0011/2631/112631v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,159],"assets/images/resized/0011/2631/112631v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director,
