When someone with matched social desires is now within your magnetU network, you will get into the fun part of raising your popularity in the real world: magnetU was created with dozens of social match messages categorized as Red-Hot, Hot and Attractive sent to your mobile phone right there on the spot. All this takes place without having users to do a thing â€“ just &#8220;Set it and forget it!&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>Bringing Facebook, Twitter and other (including Foursquare) to life inside dynamic social proximity â€œstreet networksâ€, you can also wear your Facebook, Twitter profiles (and others) when you&#8217;re out and about. Take it out on campus, to clubs, bars, festivals - everywhere and magnetU will work for you to raise your popularity with people you like, anywhere you wish. </p>\n\n<p>Combining 802.15.4 broadcast technology and its dynamic social proximity algorithms to create dynamic broadcasted-based social proximity networks, proximity touch technology and Bluetooth to communicate with the user mobile phone, the magnetU wearable social device works in conjunction with over 75% of available mobile phones (smart and features phones). </p>\n\n<p>magnetU includes a proximity touch technology that exchange information between two or more magnetU devices that make a cheers gesture (just as clinking together two drinks), enabling to add each other as Facebook friends, Twitter followers, exchange business details, and other apps.</p>\n\n<p>The magnetU pass-it-on dynamic social proximity networks are created by people themselves, as they walk or visit places â€“ INDOORS as well as outdoors, without knowing usersâ€™ location (it&#8217;s not GPS-based). The real-world is a dynamic place; some people stay put, while others move around, passing between one &#8216;network&#8217; area and another. magnetU connects all these small networks into one huge social proximity network because people in the network can act as &#8216;carriers&#8217; or â€˜routersâ€™ of other users.</p>\n\n<p>magnetU is also about opening its social proximity network accessory to developers and allow the creation of further applications and games in its dynamic social proximity networks. Developers can create a simple HTML form which turns into an application running on the magnetU device, resulting with application development to take only a few days.</p>\n\n<p>magnetU works with sales reps in more than 15 countries to promote its products through retail, mobile operators and brands. Enabling proximity coupons, merchants can send coupons to interested users in proximity based on user&#8217;s gender, age and social desires.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0015/0508/150508v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0015/0508/150508v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0015/0508/150508v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Yaron","last_name":"Moradi","permalink":"yaron-moradi-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0552/150552v2-max-150x150.png"],[[184,222],"assets/images/resized/0015/0552/150552v2-max-250x250.png"],[[184,222],"assets/images/resized/0015/0552/150552v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP,
