It is the easiest way to enroll in programs and classes for your health while earning rewards.</p>\n\n<p>Cooleaf works with local Providers of health and wellness services such as health clubs, yoga/pilates studios, personal trainers, boot camps, nutritionists, alternative health providers and others.  Cooleaf creates &#8216;Program&#8217; listings from these Providers.  These &#8216;Programs&#8217; include group fitness, yoga, and other classes that might occur on a weekly basis.  Programs may also include bundled packages and specialized regiments designed by Providers (e.g. 4 week weight loss programs).</p>\n\n<p>Consumers can use Cooleaf to quickly and efficiently search Programs that exist in a particular geography.  Through Cooleaf, consumers may quickly filter and search by various criteria (including day of week, skill level, time of day, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Once a consumer has found program(s) that they find appealing, Cooleaf provides full enrollment capabilities into classes/programs and processes payments on its site.  In addition, all Program purchases on Cooleaf earn consumers reward points that may be redeemed for merchandise, gift cards, charitable contributions, and other classes and programs on Cooleaf.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to its base consumer offering, Cooleaf is available as a corporate wellness and engagement platform.  In this capacity, Employers can leverage its platform as a solution for reducing health care costs, improving employee engagement, and supporting an overall positive working environment and satisfied workforce.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0014/6818/146818v2-max-150x150.png"],[[231,98],"assets/images/resized/0014/6818/146818v2-max-250x250.png"],[[231,98],"assets/images/resized/0014/6818/146818v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sarwar","last_name":"Bhuiyan","permalink":"sarwar-bhuiyan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Prem","last_name":"Bhatia","permalink":"prem-bhatia","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Duisberg","permalink":"john-duisberg","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
