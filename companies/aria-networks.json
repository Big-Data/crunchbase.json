The principal applications addressed are in the areas of network service optimisation and short-to-long term strategic planning of network architecture and capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The company develops technology capable of analytical processes that exceed the abilities of either manual analysis or existing &#8216;linear&#8217; software solution. This is achieved using a number of AI techniques, including neural networks and genetic algorithms.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0004/4765/44765v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/4765/44765v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[368,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/4765/44765v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5.05M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.aria-networks.com/news/news_seraphim_120508.html","source_description":"ARIA NETWORKS SECURES Â£2MILLION SERIES-A INVESTMENT FROM SERAPHIM CAPITAL","raised_amount":3950000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Seraphim Capital","permalink":"seraphim-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0005/0213/50213v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[169,64],"assets/images/resized/0005/0213/50213v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[169,64],"assets/images/resized/0005/0213/50213v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://pevc.dowjones.com/article?an=DJFVW00020121005e8a5q0c9f&from=alert&pid=32&ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fpevc.dowjones.com%3a80%2farticle%3fan%3dDJFVW00020121005e8a5q0c9f%26from%3dalert%26pid%3d32","source_description":"U.K.'s Aria Networks Secures $1.1M for Network-Management Software","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":5,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Seraphim Capital","permalink":"seraphim-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0005/0213/50213v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[169,64],"assets/images/resized/0005/0213/50213v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[169,64],"assets/images/resized/0005/0213/50213v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Capital for Enterprise","permalink":"capital-for-enterprise","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/0620/100620v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/0620/100620v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/0620/100620v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"Bath Road ","address2":"Avonbridge House","zip_code":"SN15 2BB ","city":"Chippenham ","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.4515283,"longitude":-2.1334555}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0004/4764/44764v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0004/4764/44764v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,367],"assets/images/resized/0004/4764/44764v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
