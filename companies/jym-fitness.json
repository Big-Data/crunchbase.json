The device is also known as the new bull worker and putting a digital spin on isometric exercise.</p>\n\n<p>==Jym the product==\nJym is a low-impact total body workout for exercise and rehabilitation and is easy to do for all fitness and age groups. Jym combines isometric and static exercises using your bodyâ€™s own resistance all in one compact machine to strengthen and tone muscles and reduce pain and strain on joints. Jym is ideal for isolated therapy on problem areas, through to whole body workouts. </p>\n\n<p>There are three main movements which can be achieved by using Jym- the Grip, the Pull and the Press. By using these to target specific muscles and body zones you can build a custom program around your own ability and needs. Jym is also versatile so when you improve or your needs change a program with Jym changes with you. \nJym employs eight separate force gauges to sense a userâ€™s strength.  The force gauges used are traditionally found in scales and record the force from as little as 0.2 grams or 0.4 lbs.\nLike many hand dynamometers Jym measures grip strength but unlike traditional dynamometers it is the first product that allows the user to measure muscles throughout your whole body. A blue backlit LCD screen is used to display the userâ€™s force and has a built in computer that allows you to measure and records through five different modes- Present Force, Grip Count, Accumulated Force, Timer and Hold. </p>\n\n<p>Use Jym to build strength for fitness or recreation or as therapy to help prevent, rebuild or slow muscle and bone deterioration: General Fitness, Arthritis &amp; Muscle Pain, Disability &amp; Rehabilitation, Muscle Building, Young &amp; Old, Sport &amp; Recreation and Musicians. </p>\n\n<p>===Development history===\nIt was in Australian that the initial idea for Jym was first considered. Much research was undertaken and in 2006 development began. A relationship was forged between Jym and Titoma, a Taiwanese company specialising in product design, development and manufacture and from there the idea for Jym was realised.  As with any new product it wasnâ€™t all smooth sailing. Late in the development engineering/manufacturing difficulties where found relating to the overall strength of the product but with a lot of work from Titoma these were overcome and the product can now handle a maximum force of 200kg/440lb. Jym was then released onto the market in late 2009 and the is in the process of worldwide distribution.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0007/5859/75859v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/5859/75859v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[412,95],"assets/images/resized/0007/5859/75859v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Stephanie","last_name":"Hill","permalink":"stephanie-hill","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Jones","permalink":"michael-jones-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sydney Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
