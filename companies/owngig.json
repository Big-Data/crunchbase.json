We saw a gap in the market and Owngig.com allows fans to club together to get their own special one-off artist events â€“ at a fraction of the price.</p>\n\n<p>To artists, we offer them a way of promoting themselves directly to their fanbase â€“ without having to rely on record labels. Fans register at the site, tell us about the acts you want to see, where you want to see them and how much you would be willing to pay. </p>\n\n<p>Owngig.com then regularly tracks such requests and identifies trends across all users. This then enables us to negotiate on your behalf with artist management companies and their agents to commission exclusive shows wherever and whenever demand dictates.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of the Owngig concept is how scalable it is. The bigger the band the bigger the number of fans thereâ€™ll be â€“ and therefore the potential number bids. </p>\n\n<p>The entire experience is customisable, the band and fans can work together to create the show. For example acoustic sets, requested tracks and the opportunity to meet the act themselves.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/4090/44090v1-max-150x150.png"],[[246,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/4090/44090v1-max-250x250.png"],[[246,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/4090/44090v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Owngig.com","permalink":"owngig-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Davies","permalink":"richard-davies-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Owngig.com","address1":"1&2 Barley Shotts","address2":"246 Acklam Road","zip_code":" W10 5YG","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":39.39615,"longitude":22.76303}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
