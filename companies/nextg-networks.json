NextG Networks DAS networks balance the aesthetics requirements of communities and consumers with the network performance needs of wireless carriers. Performance improvements include increased voice quality, greater handling of call traffic, fewer dropped calls, better mobile coverage, faster file transfers, and enhanced video quality. </p>\n\n<p>NextG&#8217;s innovative fiber-optic architecture, low-impact, low-emission equipment, and municipal rights-of-way agreements are the foundation of each NextG DAS Network. Because the networks are protocol and frequency neutral, they can carry cellular, PCS, 3G or any combination of wireless frequencies, standards and technologies. The networks serve residential, urban, and difficult-to-zone areas across the United States for numerous carriers of all sizes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/3042/33042v1-max-150x150.png"],[[158,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/3042/33042v1-max-250x250.png"],[[158,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/3042/33042v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"J.
