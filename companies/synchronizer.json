Users can start conversations, track conversations, and participate in other people&#8217;s conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Several unique functions allow conversations to happen more honestly than they would in other settings - namely, the ability to make &#8220;anonymous&#8221; comments and the ability to restrict access to a particular conversation to only those users who were authorized by the owner of the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>This site allows users to create a topic (&#8220;room&#8221;) that they want to discuss, and invite a group of people to join them in discussing it.  Since people can write anonymous comments, it is a great opportunity to get honest feedback or insight without people worrying about having the comment tied to their name.</p>\n\n<p>This site is ideal for groups of people who want to say what they are really thinking and ask others what they are thinking.  A unique feature of this site is that it acts more like a text message than a normal chat room - people check what others wrote when they want, and they respond when they want.  Unlike other &#8220;chat&#8221; rooms, the conversation doesn&#8217;t require being online, so a conversation can develop slowly.  The &#8220;track&#8221; feature allows a person to see what has happened in their various conversations since they last participated.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0010/2142/102142v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0010/2142/102142v1-max-250x250.png"],[[311,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/2142/102142v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
