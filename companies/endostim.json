In severe cases, patients may opt for surgical anti-reflux procedures that are costly and invasive.\nEndoStim has developed a procedure that offers a lower cost, interventional solution for treating severe or refractory GERD and reach the many patients currently unresponsive to or dissatisfied with their medical therapy.\nGERD affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide, including 30 million in the United States.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0009/4170/94170v2-max-150x150.png"],[[196,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/4170/94170v2-max-250x250.png"],[[196,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/4170/94170v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chief Medical Officer","person":{"first_name":"Virender","last_name":"Sharma","permalink":"virender-sharma","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BARRX Medical","permalink":"barrx-medical","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0009/3739/93739v1-max-150x150.png"],[[198,60],"assets/images/resized/0009/3739/93739v1-max-250x250.png"],[[198,60],"assets/images/resized/0009/3739/93739v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"EndoGastric Solutions","permalink":"endogastric-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0006/7935/67935v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/7935/67935v1-max-250x250.png"],[[311,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/7935/67935v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Enteric Medical Technologies","permalink":"enteric-medical-technologies","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Medigus","permalink":"medigus","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Torax Medical","permalink":"torax-medical","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0021/2367/212367v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0021/2367/212367v1-max-250x250.png"],[[337,106],"assets/images/resized/0021/2367/212367v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$6M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2010/07/19/daily1.html?ana=yfcpc","source_description":"St. Louis Business Journal","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sante Ventures","permalink":"sante-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/8779/48779v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0004/8779/48779v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[275,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/8779/48779v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Vectis Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund","permalink":"vectis-healthcare-life-sciences-fund","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"St. Louis","state_code":"MO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
