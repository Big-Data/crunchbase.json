Managed by Trade Me Ltd the site was founded in 1999 by New Zealand entrepreneur Sam Morgan who sold it to Fairfax in 2006 for NZ$750 million. Trade Me Ltd also operates several sister websites including Find Someone, Old Friends, Travelbug, Safe Trader and Holiday Houses.</p>\n\n<p>Trade Me&#8217;s website is the second most visited in New Zealand after Google New Zealand, and is ranked 1,213th globally according to Alexa Internet.[1] As of 2006, the group of sites collectively generate over 60% of all web traffic originating in New Zealand.  In a country with a population around 4,177,000,[3] the TradeMe site currently has around 2.5 million active members, with approximately 70,000 people online and 1,390,000 auctions running during peak hours.</p>\n\n<p>Participating traders primarily use New Zealand&#8217;s banking system to settle payments, although Trade Me now offers sellers the ability to accept credit card payments by &#8216;Pay Now&#8217;. Australian sellers must have a New Zealand bank-account, while sellers from other countries are not allowed on the site, which reduces the potential for fraud. Many buyers pay cash on pickup with larger items â€” probably partially due to the relative concentration of the New Zealand population in a relatively small number of urban areas.</p>\n\n<p>Trade Me shares many features with other online auction-websites, such as eBay. Some of these features include &#8220;Buy Now&#8221;, &#8220;Auto bidding&#8221; and the Safe Trader escrow service. Members in New Zealand can become &#8220;Address Verified&#8221; by confirming their street-address, and sellers may choose to block unverified members from bidding.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0006/6970/66970v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/6970/66970v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,58],"assets/images/resized/0006/6970/66970v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"P.O.
