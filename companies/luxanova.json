Luxanova, derived from the Latin terms lux meaning “light” and nova meaning “new”, is the perfect name for a company that strives to shine a new light on the education industry. Luxanova is developing a learning management platform, primarily serving the higher education market for small to mid-size colleges and universities.</p>\n\n<p>Luxanova is building a Learning Management System (LMS)/Content Management System (CMS)/Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Luxanova’s understanding of the frustrations of administrators, professors, and students inspired us to build a new type of LMS. Complicated GUI, unnecessarily high learning curves, and a lack of robust functionality has burdened end users with a product that fails to meet expectations. Luxanova’s solution is an all-in-one system that has a simplified GUI, a small learning curve for end users, and a more powerful functionality.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"Yang","permalink":"tamara-yang","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Jen","permalink":"ben-jen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Treasurer","person":{"first_name":"Shaw-wen","last_name":"Yang","permalink":"shaw-wen-yang","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Clifford","last_name":"Sanders","permalink":"clifford-sanders","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Louise","last_name":"Lu","permalink":"louise-lu","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"eFront","permalink":"efront","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,74],"assets/images/resized/0013/3003/133003v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[145,74],"assets/images/resized/0013/3003/133003v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[145,74],"assets/images/resized/0013/3003/133003v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"itslearning","permalink":"itslearning","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0013/2996/132996v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,78],"assets/images/resized/0013/2996/132996v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,78],"assets/images/resized/0013/2996/132996v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Blackboard, Moodle, Desire2Learn, Sakai, ATutor, Moodlerooms, RemoteLearner","permalink":"blackboard-moodle-desire2learn-sakai-atutor-moodlerooms-remotelearner","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Ben Jen Online, LLC","permalink":"ben-jen-online-llc","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$113k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Shaw","last_name":"Yang","permalink":"shaw-yang","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Louise","last_name":"P Lu","permalink":"louise-p-lu","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":62500,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"385 Caterina Hts","address2":"","zip_code":"01742","city":"Concord","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Mailing Address","address1":"PO Box 171443","address2":"","zip_code":"02117","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
