AirHopâ€™s eSON products are the first to completely address the installation, operation and performance challenges of multi-layer, small cell deployments.</p>\n\n<p>AirHopâ€™s eSONâ„¢ technology is revolutionary because it solves the RAN gap problem by enabling the deployment of unplanned small cells via not only auto-configuration and maintenance but, more importantly, dynamic optimization while they are in operation. With the use of eSON, networks can achieve the performance required by the 3G or 4G standard without traditional planning or when traditional planning is not viable. </p>\n\n<p>AirHop is privately-held and based in San Diego, CA. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/7994/117994v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/7994/117994v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/7994/117994v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Yan","last_name":"Hui","permalink":"yan-hui","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Garrett","last_name":"Choi","permalink":"garrett-choi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, VP of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Hanson","last_name":"On","permalink":"hanson-on","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"The David James Agency","permalink":"the-david-james-agency","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,48],"assets/images/resized/0014/9060/149060v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,48],"assets/images/resized/0014/9060/149060v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,48],"assets/images/resized/0014/9060/149060v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"6150 Lusk Blvd.","address2":"Suite B202","zip_code":"92121","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/9517/209517v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/9517/209517v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,320],"assets/images/resized/0020/9517/209517v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=201955","title":"Light Reading Top Ten Startups to Watch in 2011"},{"external_url":"http://www.airhopcomm-web.com/whitepaper.html","title":"eSON Whitepaper"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgsp16GPSSI&feature=player_embedded","title":"AirHop eSON HSPA Demo"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVJmENCHxoc","title":"AirHop LTE HetNet Demo"},{"external_url":"http://electronicdesign.com/article/communications/Small-Cell-Wireless-Networks-Roll-Out-Ready-or-Not.aspx","title":"Electronic Design: Small-Cell Wireless Networks Roll Out, Ready or Not"},{"external_url":"http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=198614","title":"Light Reading: AirHop, picoChip Scale Back to 3G"}]}
