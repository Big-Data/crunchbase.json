They provide some of the world&#8217;s largest mobile network operators, governments, and device vendors with innovative solutions that deliver the performance, reliability, and compelling business economics they require so they can stay ahead of their competition and offer their subscribers the value-added services they demand.</p>\n\n<p>Our 3GPP based mobile broadband network equipment has been deployed in over a dozen networks around the globe including T-Mobile Czech Republic, one of the world&#8217;s most successful and largest mobile operator broadband networks. Our mobile broadband network equipment also serves as the underpinnings for some of the largest government agency city- and countywide-communication networks, including New York City&#8217;s NYCWiN and SGRITA. IPWireless&#8217; mobile broadband base stations and subscriber terminals provide the speed, reliability and performance necessary to support critical lines of communication between a city and its public safety agencies, such as police, fire, sanitation and anti-terrorism departments, that  are necessary for keeping their consitutencies and communities safe not only in the event of an emergency but in day-to-day life. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0006/6732/66732v1-max-150x150.png"],[[177,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6732/66732v1-max-250x250.png"],[[177,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6732/66732v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Director, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Enlai","last_name":"Chu","permalink":"enlai-chu-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Morrissette","permalink":"mark-morrissette","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/2394/172394v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/2394/172394v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/2394/172394v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$25.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.ipwireless.com/news/pressreleases/press111809","source_description":"IPWireless","raised_amount":15500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Spark Capital","permalink":"spark-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/6120/16120v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/6120/16120v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/6120/16120v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":{"name":"Lockheed Martin","permalink":"lockheed-martin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/3883/23883v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/3883/23883v2-max-250x250.png"],[[264,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3883/23883v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.ipwireless.com/node/125","source_description":"Sprint Nextel Leads New Investment in IPWireless","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Sprint Nextel","permalink":"sprint-nextel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7820/17820v1-max-150x150.png"],[[219,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/7820/17820v1-max-250x250.png"],[[219,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/7820/17820v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Greenways Business Park Unit 7","address2":"Bellinger Close","zip_code":"SN15 1BN","city":"Chippenham, Wiltshire","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"90 New Montgomery Street","address2":"Suite 315","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"General Dynamics announces plan to purchase IPWireless","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":8,"source_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/08/generaldynamics-idUSL1E8G80E920120508","source_text":null,"source_description":"Reuters","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"IPWireless","permalink":"ipwireless"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/7368/67368v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0006/7368/67368v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0006/7368/67368v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
