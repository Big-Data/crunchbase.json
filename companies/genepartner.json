Theyâ€™ve analyzed â€œhundreds of couplesâ€ and have determined the genetic patterns found in successful relationships. Based on their algorithm and your DNA, theyâ€™ll determine the probability for a satisfying and long-lasting relationship between two people.</p>\n\n<p>A brush for collecting your DNA sample from your saliva â€“ called a buccal swab kit â€“ will be sent to your address. Following the simple instructions included with the kit you will gently collect the DNA from the inside of your cheek. Use the addressed envelope supplied for returning the brushes.</p>\n\n<p>GenePartner is looking to partner with dating sites and have those services encourage users to see if theyâ€™re a DNA match. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/2472/22472v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/2472/22472v1-max-250x250.png"],[[330,120],"assets/images/resized/0002/2472/22472v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"Brown","permalink":"tamara-brown","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"23andMe","permalink":"23andme","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/1291/1291v3-max-150x150.png"],[[105,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/1291/1291v3-max-250x250.png"],[[105,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/1291/1291v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ScientificMatch","permalink":"scientificmatch","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0002/2485/22485v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,152],"assets/images/resized/0002/2485/22485v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,152],"assets/images/resized/0002/2485/22485v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Schlossgasse 9","address2":"","zip_code":"8003","city":"Zurich","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHE","latitude":47.368986,"longitude":8.519982}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
