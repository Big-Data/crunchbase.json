Playmark&#8217;s marketplace bridges the gap by making business deals involving athletes as easy as e-commerce. Professional athletes can now sell official rights, content, and access.</p>\n\n<p>What began as a strategic partnership with the NFL Players Association became a new venture when George Aposporos and Erik Bergsagel founded Playmark in December 2010. Playmark&#8217;s online and mobile platform was built from ground up to increase access to the largest professional roster in America: over 2,000 NFL players.</p>\n\n<p>Playmark has a multi-year exclusive with NFL Players. Since the launch of Playmark.com in October of 2011, Playmark has reduced the average time to close a licensing deal with NFL Players from 35 weeks down to 2. The record time to close a deal is 3 days&#8211;as fast as buying a pair of shoes online. </p>\n\n<p>Located near the world famous Pike Place Market in Seattle, Playmark is privately funded from strategic partners and angel investors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0017/6471/176471v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0017/6471/176471v2-max-250x250.png"],[[366,79],"assets/images/resized/0017/6471/176471v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Aposporos","permalink":"george-aposporos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Bergsagel","permalink":"erik-bergsagel","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Playmark Seattle","address1":"119 Pine Street","address2":"Suite 301","zip_code":"98101","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
