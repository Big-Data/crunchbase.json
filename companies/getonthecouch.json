Whether you are just friends, on the hunt, dating, committed, engaged, married, taking a break, separated, or divorced - The Couch can assist!</p>\n\n<p>The Couch Concept was born by Co-Founder, Eric Weisholtz, who recognized a need for relationship support amongst his family and friends who were already under the attention of Certified Counselors, Psychologists, or Psychiatrists. Repeatedly, Eric witnessed people paying for advice, only to gain few, or no positive results. Consequently, he decided to create an online community where members could gain valuable insight from fellow Couch Comrades who have similar experiences to draw upon.</p>\n\n<p>The Couch Community is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
