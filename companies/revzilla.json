Chances are if you call us more then once you will talk to the same representative, or even one of the owners.  We try to always answer at least a couple of general calls a day, as while it may sound clichÃ©, listening to our customers really is one of the most powerful tools we have found.<br/>\nAt RevZilla, we know that a large and rider-specific product selection is a commodity within the world of motorcycle gear and parts web sites. There is a lot of competition out there and to an extent we all have overlapping product selections.\nWe hope our straight-forward and fair customer approach differentiates us from the pack and speaks to how serious we are about putting our customer&#8217;s satisfaction as our number one priority.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0013/7654/137654v4-max-150x150.png"],[[200,49],"assets/images/resized/0013/7654/137654v4-max-250x250.png"],[[200,49],"assets/images/resized/0013/7654/137654v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"38 Jackson St","address2":"","zip_code":"19148","city":"Philadelphia","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"286\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hl3N1dKvsis?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hl3N1dKvsis?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"450\" height=\"286\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>RevZilla Philosophy on Service</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
