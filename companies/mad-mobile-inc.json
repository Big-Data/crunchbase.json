Mad Mobileâ€™s platform can quickly mobilize content and functionality from desktop sites without requiring clients to dedicate IT resources.</p>\n\n<p>Their unique Mobile Web Platform (MWP) enables us to quickly mobilize entire websites - including all content and functions. Even sophisticated e-commerce sites with dynamic content can be mobilized with minimal impact to technical resources.</p>\n\n<p>The MWP detects mobile users and automatically redirects them to a mobile version of their site, completely optimized for their device. Mobile content is dynamically pulled the customer&#8217;s site using their Mobile Proxy Service and presented in custom mobile UIs they create.  This approach enables their clients to leverage content from their PC site and eliminates the need to manage a separate content store for their mobile website. </p>\n\n<p>The MWP features very sophisticated device detection capabilities and content adaptation functions to optimize the experience for each mobile user. Beyond simple browser detection, the MWP analyzes both user agent info and more granular WURLF data to determine the proper display specifications and device capabilities (e.g. Video yes/no). It is essential that your mobile websites render properly on every mobile device, regardless of carrier or browser type. There are currently 400+ different handsets in the US market, each with unique capabilities and specifications for browser type, display size, resolution, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Mad Mobile is an active member of the Mobile Marketing Association and developed the official MMA mobile websites. Mad Mobile CEO, Greg Schmitzer, is a key member of the MMAâ€™s newly formed Mobile Web &amp; Apps committee.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0013/6381/136381v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/6381/136381v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0013/6381/136381v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"Bennett","permalink":"bruce-bennett","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Kelly","permalink":"ryan-kelly-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Schmitzer","permalink":"greg-schmitzer","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Usablenet","permalink":"usablenet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0012/4680/124680v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,162],"assets/images/resized/0012/4680/124680v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,162],"assets/images/resized/0012/4680/124680v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":".Digby","permalink":"digby-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Moovweb","permalink":"moovweb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0006/4921/64921v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/4921/64921v1-max-250x250.png"],[[274,72],"assets/images/resized/0006/4921/64921v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Netbiscuits","permalink":"netbiscuits","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0004/3392/43392v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0004/3392/43392v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/3392/43392v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Foley and Lardner","permalink":"foley-and-lardner","image":null}},{"title":"Accounting/Audit","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Pender Newkirk","permalink":"pender-newkirk","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"1715 N Westshore Blvd","address2":"Suite 600","zip_code":"33607","city":"Tampa","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0013/8333/138333v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/8333/138333v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0013/8333/138333v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
