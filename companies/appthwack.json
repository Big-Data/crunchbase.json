Even the wealthiest companies struggle while smaller shops are left to release and hope for the best. AppThwack solves this problem by automatically detecting any problems encountered while installing, launching, and stress-testing the apps on an ever-growing lab of real devices AppThwack hosts. In addition, AppThwack supports custom tests via multiple automation platforms (Robotium, MonkeyTalk, and others). Reports generate in real time and contain high-level results, low-level details, performance data, and pixel-perfect screenchots.</p>\n\n<p>Its initial offering is for native Android apps, and they are currently in private beta for mobile web testing (Multiple browsers on real devices). Other platforms, such as iOS, are on the way.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/3790/213790v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/3790/213790v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/3790/213790v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Trent","last_name":"Peterson","permalink":"trent-peterson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Pawel","last_name":"Wojnarowicz","permalink":"pawel-wojnarowicz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":" 1227 NW Davis Street","address2":"","zip_code":"97209","city":"Portland","state_code":"OR","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"430\" height=\"270\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/pJblzg1iB7M?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/pJblzg1iB7M?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>AppThwack at PIE Demo Day</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
