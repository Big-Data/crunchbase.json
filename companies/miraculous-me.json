There is not yet the equivalent of a self-help Facebook or a spiritual YouTube. A paradigm shift is in the making, and Miraculous.Me seeks to exploit the disruptions created by this new shift. </p>\n\n<p>Miraculous.Me disrupts models that see the future exclusively in terms of friends, interests, and locations. Recent discoveries in social psychology and neuroscience have proven just how contagious the emotions are. People who donâ€™t know each other, arenâ€™t in the same location, and donâ€™t share the same interests are deeply interconnected â€“ and influenced â€“ by the emotions and spirituality of the cloud. Miraculous.Me brings us together by our encouragement.graphs, love.graphs, and peace.graphs. It expands our circle of relationships, and connects us in meaningful new ways. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0012/7781/127781v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0012/7781/127781v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,116],"assets/images/resized/0012/7781/127781v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Buberer Alberti","permalink":"martin-buberer-alberti","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Home Office","address1":"445 Hamilton Avenue","address2":"Suite 1102","zip_code":"10601","city":"White Plains","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
