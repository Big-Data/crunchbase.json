The company&#8217;s product portfolio utilizes InSite Vision&#8217;s proven DuraSite(R) bioadhesive polymer core technology, an innovative platform that extends the duration of drug retention on the surface of the eye, thereby reducing frequency of treatment and improving the efficacy of topically delivered drugs.
