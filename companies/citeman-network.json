The network is maintained to foster the exchange of ideas and community support - it not only provides an easy way to keep one step ahead of problems related to business management it also gives you an easy interface to network with your peers. </p>\n\n<p>What you will find in this network?</p>\n\n<p>Our network consists of seven domains -</p>\n\n<p>www.CiteMan.com - for business improvement articles \nwww.CiteHR.com - human resource management community \nwww.CiteFin.com - finance management community \nwww.CiteSales.com - sales and marketing management community \nwww.CiteOps.com - operations management community \nwww.CiteLegal.com - legal community \nwww.Inpull.com - Our job network </p>\n\n<p>Our network boasts of hundreds of thousands of members, and adding over a 1000 new members everyday. Our community sites are filled with real life problem/solution discussion threads and various other useful resources and downloads.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we here?</p>\n\n<p>Our main objective is to help people improve their organizations - and foster open discussions on all organizational problems. Over time we have sort of created a knowledgebase where people can read about various problems other people have faced and how they solved those problems.</p>\n\n<p>These real world case studies are very important if one wants to develop into a good business manager. Our members have shown tremendous attachment to our network. Becoming a member of the network makes users part of a fantastically constructive group of people who not only challenge and stimulate one to improve but also help with advice and solutions to organizational problems from their experience.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we want to do this?</p>\n\n<p>Management, I believe is a summation of lessons learnt over time - over the years we have created a set of rules to follow which confirm to our victories over management issues - loosely termed as â€œproblems at workâ€.</p>\n\n<p>As our society develops and mutates - which I believe is a direct result of changes in each individualâ€™s perception of our society - rules for management or rather implementations of these rules are changing and are constantly being adapted. I believe that the state of our society is a result of the summation of these individual perceptions - each negative perception adds problems - and each positive one - helps us work towards getting better and understanding where we are headed and where we want to be.</p>\n\n<p>Through our network we want to try to add more of these positive perceptions - through self improvement, improvement in the lives of the employees of the organizations who join us, improvement in the business they are doing. We want to let them know that they are not alone in the problems they are facing - we are all here - a tight group of people who are willing to spend a few minutes a day to help solve those small problems - so they donâ€™t add up to one very big problem!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0004/1084/41084v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[164,122],"assets/images/resized/0004/1084/41084v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[164,122],"assets/images/resized/0004/1084/41084v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Proprietor","person":{"first_name":"Sidhartha","last_name":"Roy","permalink":"sidhartha-roy","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New Delhi Office","address1":"B-7 Safdarjung Enclave","address2":"","zip_code":"110029","city":"New Delhi","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":28.5654024,"longitude":77.1959622}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
