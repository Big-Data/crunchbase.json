Some of NYC&#8217;s most brilliant entrepreneurs, freelancers, contractors, freelancers, hackers, and generally awesome people gather to work and collaborate in an open, shared, flexible environment. New Work City is also home to several Meetup groups, clubs, and an educational program aimed at helping people develop their independent careers.\nOpen to all, NWC&#8217;s community is self-enforcing and tight knit. Newcomers can just show up on any weekday, no appointment needed. Just bring some work to do and a friendly disposition, and you&#8217;ll be ready to rock!</p>\n\n<p>Day passes are $30 and memberships are $300 per month. Events range from free to reasonably priced.</p>\n\n<p>New Work City&#8217;s community arose out of the existing apartment and cafe-based Jelly and CooperBricolage communities, which started in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In 2008, New Work City signed a sublease with a startup and opened its first coworking space after a year of research and preparations. The community quickly filled the space, and used it as home base for 18 months.</p>\n\n<p>In September 2010, New Work City opened a dedicated space in a 4,700 square foot loft on Broadway and Canal Street in lower Manhattan. The new space has enabled the community to thrive, with more and better resources and event space available for use, as well as a new educational program, NWCU, aimed at helping people develop their independent careers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8804/118804v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8804/118804v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8804/118804v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and Mayor","person":{"first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Bacigalupo","permalink":"tony-bacigalupo","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New Work City HQ","address1":"412 Broadway","address2":"Floor 2","zip_code":"10013","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.observer.com/2011/media/google-new-work-citys-secret-new-sponsor","title":"Google is New Work City's Secret Sponsor"},{"external_url":"http://www.inc.com/magazine/20101001/start-ups-2010-how-to-launch-a-co-working-facility.html?nav=relatedarticle","title":"How to Launch a Coworking Facility"},{"external_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2009/october/203414.html","title":"Solo, but Not ALone"}]}
