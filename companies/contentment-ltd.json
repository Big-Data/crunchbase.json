Now is a great time to experiment. </p>\n\n<p>We believe editorial staff should be given great tools to work with, that offer every bit as good a user experience as the best consumer apps. We want to build a happier and more productive workplace. We’ll brainstorm ideas with you and help you create future books now.</p>\n\n<p>We’re soon to release a new product, Padify, that will make it easier for publishers to produce content that looks great on tablets and smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>Padify is designed to play nicely with your existing magazine or book production workflow. It’s low cost and low risk.</p>\n\n<p>We’re based in Shoreditch, London.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0018/1562/181562v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,190],"assets/images/resized/0018/1562/181562v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,190],"assets/images/resized/0018/1562/181562v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Kowalski","permalink":"michael-kowalski","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
