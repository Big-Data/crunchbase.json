backup and cloud content management.</p>\n\n<p>OpenDriveâ€™s strategy is not only to be a online storage, backup and syncing software, but also a centralized solution with integration of storage, apps and services such as tasks, social networks, project management within single interface to create uniform experience accessible from anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the unique services like selling files, advertising files, a file search engine, direct hotlinking, and API, as well as its virtual drive and virtual desktop applications, OpenDrive provides sharing, syncing, online editing, file collaboration, file versioning and other features to allow the user manage cloud content smarter and faster than ever
