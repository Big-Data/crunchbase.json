The Firm is instrumental in the early stage of a hedge fund’s growth cycle when accelerated capital raising services are needed and also brings capital to mature businesses when capacity becomes available. Asperion is disciplined in its manager selection process, which is rigorous, and benefits from the Principal’s sales and trading experience. The Firm’s extensive financial industry network affords an opportunistic approach to the selection of the hedge fund managers on its platform.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founding Principal","person":{"first_name":"Debra","last_name":"Pipines","permalink":"debra-pipines-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New York City","address1":"152 W. 57th St.","address2":"18th Floor","zip_code":"10019","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0021/7189/217189v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0021/7189/217189v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,256],"assets/images/resized/0021/7189/217189v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
