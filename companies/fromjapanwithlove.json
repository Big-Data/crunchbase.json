Our name says it all, but for those of you who are new to shopping with us we wanted to tell you a little about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>http://www.from-japan-with-love.com/</p>\n\n<p>We are a husband and wife team of Japanese and Canadian origins. I (Sofia) have been here 10 years and absolutely love the expectation of beauty that exists here. From the historical temples to the pottery and handicrafts, there is a quality of life that I did not experience back home and I think it comes down to this expectation of beauty. I fell in love with the art, the paper, the culture of crafting here and started a shop on etsy.com to make some of these things available as supplies for artists and crafters abroad. The store on etsy has been very successful and became popular quickly. I got so many requests for other types of items that simply did not qualify to be listed on etsy.com that my husband (Futoshi) and I decided to offer a wider selection of uniquely Japanese things on this site and run both sites together.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for visiting us at From-Japan-With-Love. We are looking forward to your purchase you won&#8217;t be disappointed with the quality of items and the care we take in packaging and shipping them to you.</p>\n\n<p>Tweet Our store on twitter!! http://twitter.com/kawaiishopping</p>\n\n<p>Follow us on Fan Page in Facebook!! http://www.facebook.com/fromjapanwithlove</p>\n\n<p>For more information about us, updates on products and general life in Japan stories see our blog at http://from-japan-with-love.blogspot.com/</p>\n\n<p>Our Other Stores on Etsy</p>\n\n<p>For handmade rings http://souzoucreations.etsy.com</p>\n\n<p>For Japanese vintage goods http://vintagefromjapan.etsy.com</p>\n\n<p>For Japanese stickers, fabric, and more http://fromjapanwithlove.etsy.com</p>\n\n<p>For wholesale prices on cabochons, clay canes and more http://decosweets.etsy.com</p>\n\n<p>Our contact information</p>\n\n<p>By email:from-japan-with-love@hotmail.com</p>\n\n<p>from-japan-with-love@hotmail.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,75],"assets/images/resized/0011/9061/119061v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[75,75],"assets/images/resized/0011/9061/119061v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[75,75],"assets/images/resized/0011/9061/119061v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0011/9060/119060v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0011/9060/119060v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0011/9060/119060v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
