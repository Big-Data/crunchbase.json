The ZVoice framework uses your voice to control your applications, research topics on the internet, find the time or weather and get directions by using your voice. </p>\n\n<p>It uses traditional forms of input combined with alternative modes like speech, mouse gestures, and natural language commands. These products condense commonly performed tasks and functions into a focused user intuitive interface for all of your devices.</p>\n\n<p>ZVoice is different from the other speech recognition products. Existing speech recognition solutions have primarily focused on information retrieval. Zvoice resolves a statement into an actionable command for execution in your personal Cloud rather than a simple request for information.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Nathaniel","last_name":"Cooper","permalink":"nathaniel-cooper","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.thevoicesoftware.com/license/spring/content/videos.html","title":"Videos"}]}
