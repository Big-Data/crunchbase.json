The site aggregates ticket listings for live sports, concert, and theater events and presents them to consumers within an elegant and powerful user interface that makes finding the best value on events tickets painless and easy.</p>\n\n<p>SeatGeek focuses on data. Its data engine is geared towards helping consumers identify the best ticket deals. The site has a feature called Deal Scoreâ„¢ that assigns a 0-100 metric to all listed tickets in order to ascertain the relative value of tickets for a given event or set of similar events. </p>\n\n<p>SeatGeek also offers consumers a robust event discovery tool through its Columbus event calendar and Spotify applications, which take into account user preferences and favorited teams and artists in order to generate accurate recommendations of upcoming local events that match a user&#8217;s tastes and preferences.</p>\n\n<p>Launched in September 2009 at TechCrunch50, SeatGeek is
