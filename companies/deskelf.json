There&#8217;s an Elf for that.</p>\n\n<p>In their own words:\n&#8220;The concept of DeskElf is simple: We&#8217;re a team of affordable employees working remotely with a proven track record of reliable quality service. We offer a wide range of services designed to help entrepreneurs and small businesses bring their ideas in to reality.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs have brilliant ideas. Many of us lack the technical knowledge and skills to bring our ideas to fruition, while financial backings can be difficult to find these days. Many of us have resorted to outsourcing to companies abroad or hiring freelancers.

Our employees are willing and able to expand their professional educations, keeping up with the time and trends of business and technology. We live in economic conditions below the standard of the US, and along with our network of corporate and personal offices, we&#8217;re able to offer our services at rates more affordable than those of freelancers and without the cultural and language barriers commonly found with outsourcing companies.&#8221;</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Avi","last_name":"Zuber","permalink":"avi-zuber","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"oDesk","permalink":"odesk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0000/3565/3565v10-max-150x150.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/3565/3565v10-max-250x250.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/3565/3565v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main","address1":"358 Chesnut Hill Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"02445","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Global","address1":"8/1 Sivanit","address2":"","zip_code":"94558","city":"Beit Shemesh","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
