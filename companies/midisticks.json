The drumsticks can be trained to detect and identify a number of surface materials. The identified materials are then mapped to industry standard MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) messages. </p>\n\n<p>The final effect is that drumming on different surfaces (Tabletop, mouse mat, pad of paper, seat cushion etcâ€¦) can produce different sounds via MIDI messages associated with those surfaces i.e. your surroundings could become a simple drum set.</p>\n\n<p>The MIDI messages, themselves, are generated by a separate device (for example PC/Mac), which could also accept external MIDI messages (for example from a MIDI bass drum pedal and Hi Hat Controller pedal).</p>\n\n<p>The sticks are velocity sensitive - meaning that the more delicately a material is played, the quieter the associated sound produced (i.e. the velocity parameter associated with the MIDI message issued by the system varies depending on how firmly a surface is struck).</p>\n\n<p>Unlike some other similar products, the sticksâ€™ sensitivity together with their bounce and response following a strike allow for quite realistic drumming effects and techniques (e.g. subtle buzzes and rolls). </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0007/6220/76220v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0007/6220/76220v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[330,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/6220/76220v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / MD","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Cordani","permalink":"andrew-cordani","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"IP","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Baron Warren Redfern","permalink":"baron-warren-redfern","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Registered Office","address1":"1 Lynwood Road","address2":"Tooting","zip_code":"SW17 8SB","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.midisticks.com","title":"Main website"},{"external_url":"http://www.midisticks.info","title":"Forum"}]}
