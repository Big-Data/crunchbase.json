These differences require ISVs to change how they build, deploy, market, and sell; the starkly dissimilar revenue models mean ISVs need to adjust not only the way they recognize revenue but the speed and efficiency with which they generate it.</p>\n\n<p>Keychain Logic&#8217;s customizable services are based on accepted best practices for technology service providers:</p>\n\n<p>Strategic Leadership: Successful SaaS deployments result from robust planning and visionary entrepreneurship.
