We know that a current and future crop of entrepreneurial CEOs will emerge given the proper platform. </p>\n\n<p>Red Brick Ventures brings together ideas, capital, and would-be entrepreneurs behind the safety of our red brick walls.  We invent and source original consumer tech ideas from all over the world, and fund development of them for the Japan market through initial iterations, go to market, and post-launch. In risk-averse Japanese corporate culture, we break down the barriers to innovation and make it easier for talented Japanese would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge into a startup by taking steps to reduce personal, legal and reputation risk. These include financial support and hands-on mentoring by Red Brick Ventures partners and executives of our venture capital co-investors, as well as access to our world-class network.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0019/9812/199812v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0019/9812/199812v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,205],"assets/images/resized/0019/9812/199812v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"J.
