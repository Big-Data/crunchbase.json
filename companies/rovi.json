It offers guidance, home network connection, content protection, and media recognition technologies, as well as extensive metadata on movies, music, games, television, and books. The companyâ€™s media guide technology is an interactive on-screen portal to entertainment content from the Internet, broadcast, and personal content. It also provides other interactive program guides (IPG) for the consumer electronic, and cable and satellite provider market. These program guides help viewers navigate through, sort, select, and schedule video programming for viewing and recording. In addition, Rovi Corporation offers home networking technology to simplify the transfer of content from one device to another within the home. The companyâ€™s extensive entertainment metadata portfolio is used in its guidance and media recognition technologies, as well as licensed to online entertainment content distributors. Further, it offers advertising services targeted at consumers on its IPGs. The company provides legacy content protection technologies as deterrence for unauthorized consumer copying of such programming on VCRs and recordable DVD devices. It primarily serves entertainment, consumer electronics, cable and satellite, and online distribution markets. The company was formerly known as Macrovision Solutions Corporation and changed its name to Rovi Corporation on July 16, 2009. Rovi Corporation was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,70],"assets/images/resized/0008/0614/80614v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,70],"assets/images/resized/0008/0614/80614v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,70],"assets/images/resized/0008/0614/80614v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President
