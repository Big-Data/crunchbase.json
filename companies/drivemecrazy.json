To flag a vehicle, users simply speak in the license plate of the vehicle (i.e. hands-free) and a record of the incident is created in the DriveMeCrazy database.  The service is currently available as a free app in the iTunes store and on the company web site.  </p>\n\n<p>Once a vehicle is flagged, end-users can write tickets, leave audio messages, and lookup other driversâ€™ records.  The app also allows to search any plate, listen to the best messages, etc.  By offering driver feedback and created driver peer pressure, the company&#8217;s long-term vision is to reduce crashes caused by distracted and aggressive driving.  </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Inghelbrecht","permalink":"philip-inghelbrecht","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead engineer","person":{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Mitchell","permalink":"jane-mitchell","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Virtual Law Partners","permalink":"virtual-law-partners","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Pillsbury Winthrop","permalink":"pillsbury-winthrop","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$300k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"McClure","permalink":"dave-mcclure","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/5721/15721v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0001/5721/15721v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0001/5721/15721v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/2659065551/</p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"steve-chen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0730/10730v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0730/10730v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/0730/10730v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Clive","last_name":"Dickens","permalink":"clive-dickens-2","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
