If the user starts to receive spam messages, the user can delete that disposable email and submit a report on the website spammed them. </p>\n\n<p>All messages sent to a disposable email are forwarded to a user&#8217;s personal email account. Disposable email addresses are free, and never expire. Users can generate a disposable email by using Spamfire, the firefox plug-in, or Spamfire CR the Crome plug-in. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[60,48],"assets/images/resized/0007/1368/71368v2-max-150x150.png"],[[60,48],"assets/images/resized/0007/1368/71368v2-max-250x250.png"],[[60,48],"assets/images/resized/0007/1368/71368v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Schneeman","permalink":"richard-schneeman-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"spamex","permalink":"spamex","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"sneakemail","permalink":"sneakemail","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mailinator","permalink":"mailinator","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0004/0506/40506v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0004/0506/40506v1-max-250x250.png"],[[279,108],"assets/images/resized/0004/0506/40506v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"78727","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/g6J89CAH8es&hl=enUS&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/g6J89CAH8es&hl=enUS&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>How WhySpam Works</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0007/1367/71367v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0007/1367/71367v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0007/1367/71367v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
