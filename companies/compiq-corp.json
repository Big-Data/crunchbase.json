Our turnaround time and savings are setting the performance standard in the industry.</p>\n\n<p>ACS CompIQ Corp is very successful at developing customized EDI interfaces.Â  The reality is that EVERY EDI interface is customized to a certain degree.Â  Because we have world class software developers on staff, we are comfortable with even the most advanced levels of customization.Â  Our expertise extends to a wide variety of EDI interface technologies including the latest trends in XML web services for real time data transfer.\nThe integration most often used for our clients begins with EDI transfer of claim and provider records from the claims management system to our bill review system.Â IQReviewÂ® captures this data and makes it available to the bill review analystâ€™s production use.Â  Importantly, IQReviewÂ® tracks any unique identifiers used by the claims system and returns them as part of the next step, which is the EDI transfer of payments records back to the claims management system.Â  This allows the claims management system to identify internal claim and vendor records associated with each payment with 100% accuracy and no manual intervention. Â  Many organizations have a need to interface with multiple claims databases and even different claims systems simultaneously.Â IQReviewÂ® supports this requirement and automatically segments claim and vendor records so that the user is only presented with records from the appropriate claims system during production.\nIQReviewÂ® interfaces with all major claims management systems such as:Â  David, David Renaissance, Risk Master, VOS, VOS Portal, Talisman, Sucaba, Pyramid, Stars, RiskCo, and Gensource.Â  As we add new clients we continually build new interfaces to client specifications.Â  The interface is provided via EDI (electronic data interface) to receive claims data and vendor data from an external system as well as transmit payment information to an external system. Payment information may include bill review fees, PPO fees and more broken down in whatever manner is appropriate to our customersâ€™ AP system.Â  Â Additionally, IQReviewÂ® provides data to claims systems in an EDI format to allow the printing of EOR information on check stubs.Â \nEDI files can be transmitted via email, FTP, or floppy disk.Â  Information is also compliant with OLE, DB/ADO/ODBC - making it possible to work with any database engine.\nACS CompIQ can accept import data in almost any format.Â  Likewise, we can accommodate almost any format needed for export.Â  Files are usually fixed-length ASCII data.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0009/2653/92653v2-max-150x150.png"],[[164,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/2653/92653v2-max-250x250.png"],[[164,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/2653/92653v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
