Over 60% of all design contests held online are run through 99designs, making it by far the original and biggest graphic design marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>99designs won the <a href=\"http://blog.99designs.com/2010/05/20/thanks-for-voting-99designs-webby-award-winner/\" title=\"People&#8217;s Voice Webby Award\" rel=\"nofollow\">People&#8217;s Voice Webby Award</a> in 2010 and pay out over 1.5 million dollars a month to designers from all around the world in 192 countries. </p>\n\n<p>Within hours of a project being posted, designers from all around the world compete by uploading fully completed concept designs, which are than reviewed and rated by the project poster. At the end of the project period, a winning design is chosen and paid out the prize money.</p>\n\n<p>Typical projects receive 50-100 unique submissions, involve <a href=\"http://99designs.com/logo-design\" title=\"logo design\" rel=\"nofollow\">logo design</a>, <a href=\"http://99designs.com/web-design\" title=\"webpage design\" rel=\"nofollow\">webpage design</a>, and <a href=\"http://99designs.com/print-design\" title=\"print design\" rel=\"nofollow\">print design</a>.
