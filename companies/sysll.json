TigerMail is a text messaging application developed for the iPhone/iPod touch/iPad platforms.  </p>\n\n<p>Main features of Tigermail Pro:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It deletes any and all sent messages from both the senderâ€™s device AND the receiverâ€™s device.  Nor is there a copy of the message on our server.</li>\n<li>For a one-time price of $2.99, the user can have unlimited text messaging.  No monthly or yearly fees, ever.</li>\n<li>Instead of cell phone numbers, the identifiers used for TigerMail are based on email addresses.  This means texting around the world with practically anyone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Development will start soon for the Blackberry and Android platforms.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0008/3803/83803v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0008/3803/83803v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0008/3803/83803v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
