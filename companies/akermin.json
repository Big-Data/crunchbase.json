Commercial applications in wireless sensors and military uses are their primary focus.   </p>\n\n<p>Development for the use of stabilized enzymes in the food processing, biofuels, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries is under way.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/2884/52884v1-max-150x150.png"],[[140,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/2884/52884v1-max-250x250.png"],[[140,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/2884/52884v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.akermin.com/news/akermin_raises_5_million/","source_description":"Akermin Raises $5 Million in Just-Completed Financing Round","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":12,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Prolog Ventures","permalink":"prolog-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/9719/49719v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/9719/49719v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/9719/49719v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"OnPoint Technologies","permalink":"onpoint","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0003/0359/30359v1-max-150x150.png"],[[242,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/0359/30359v1-max-250x250.png"],[[242,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/0359/30359v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Chrysalix Energy","permalink":"chrysalix-energy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0004/3880/43880v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0004/3880/43880v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0004/3880/43880v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"St. Louis Arch Angels","permalink":"st-louis-arch-angels","image":{"available_sizes":[[[60,85],"assets/images/resized/0005/2893/52893v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[60,85],"assets/images/resized/0005/2893/52893v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[60,85],"assets/images/resized/0005/2893/52893v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"893 North Warson Rd.","address2":"","zip_code":"63141","city":"St. Louis","state_code":"MO","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.6721461,"longitude":-90.3949118}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0005/2885/52885v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0005/2885/52885v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0005/2885/52885v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
