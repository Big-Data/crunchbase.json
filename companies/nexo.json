Nexo was acquired for $15 million by Shutterfy in January of 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Launched at the January 2007 Demo conference, Nexo lets users design to design their family webpages, upload videos, photos, and integrate any other third-party widgets.  Whenever users make an update, such as an event time change, they are able to the group by email - every member can specify how often, if at all, they are notified by email. Nexo clearly caters to families, church groups, sports teams and hobby groups for example.</p>\n\n<p>Founders Jorasch and McGannon founded Octopus, a company that was backed by Redpoint among others, as well as Metropolis Software.
