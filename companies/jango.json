It brings a social networking dynamic that can be found elsewhere, but it sets itself apart from the rest of the pack because of its music-centric nature. The social network is just an added bonus. As you can imagine, you have the option to add friends and listen to their playlists or Ã¢C~tune into&#8217; their stream whenever you like. Build a rockin station and see who is listening in.</p>\n\n<p>Editing your stations is neat since you can add artists to an existing station or delete suggestions from Jango and then rate songs from each artist so you hear what you want to hear and not what you don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2008, Jango partnered with <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/panther-express\" title=\"Panther Express\">Panther Express</a> for the delivery of its audio and rich media.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2009 however, Jango switched to <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/voxel-dot-net\" title=\"Voxel dot net\">Voxel dot net</a> for its global  media delivery services.</p>\n\n<p>Currently Jango appears to be illegally streaming music but as they gain popularity this may change.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/1759/1759v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,138],"assets/images/resized/0000/1759/1759v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[214,138],"assets/images/resized/0000/1759/1759v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Jango","permalink":"jango","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Pandora Media","permalink":"pandora","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-150x150.png"],[[152,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-250x250.png"],[[152,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Slacker","permalink":"slacker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0001/7589/17589v1-max-150x150.png"],[[225,126],"assets/images/resized/0001/7589/17589v1-max-250x250.png"],[[225,126],"assets/images/resized/0001/7589/17589v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Public Relations & Social Media Marketing","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Resound Marketing","permalink":"resound-marketing","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/3214/43214v2-max-150x150.png"],[[158,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/3214/43214v2-max-250x250.png"],[[158,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/3214/43214v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.757929,"longitude":-73.985506}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
