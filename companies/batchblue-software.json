The software is especially designed for businesses that have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a limited budget or IT staff.</li>\n<li>to track contact information about their customers and any points of contact that the business has with a customer (phone calls, e-mails, purchases, returns, reservations, etc.).</li>\n<li>a need to collect industry and business specific information about their customers that canâ€™t be handled by basic e-mail management software.</li>\n<li>the desire for an easy-to-use system with excellent customer support.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The founders of BatchBlue come from a variety of programming, project management, and Web usability backgrounds, but they share a passion for technology and a commitment to making it useful and accessible for customers.</p>\n\n<p>BatchBlue&#8217;s flagship product, BatchBook, is a social CRM that allows you to keep track of your business, personal, and social networking contacts and share them with the rest of your team. You can create a flexible, easy-to-use contact database from scratch, or import your contacts from an existing system. </p>\n\n<p>BatchBlue Software is also the founder of #SBBUZZ, a weekly Twitter chat about small business and technology, and a founding member of the Small Business Web (thesmallbusinessweb.com), which is a Directory of web applications for small businesses. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0008/5266/85266v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0008/5266/85266v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,96],"assets/images/resized/0008/5266/85266v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Technology & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Ransom","permalink":"sean-ransom","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"O'Hara","permalink":"pamela-ohara","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Communications Director & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michelle","last_name":"Riggen-Ransom","permalink":"michelle-riggen-ransom","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Ruby on Rails Development","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"MojoTech","permalink":"mojotech","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0014/9218/149218v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0014/9218/149218v8-max-250x250.png"],[[300,85],"assets/images/resized/0014/9218/149218v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Wayland Square Offices","address1":"10 Elmgrove Ave.","address2":"Second Floor","zip_code":"02906","city":"Providence","state_code":"RI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0008/5263/85263v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,170],"assets/images/resized/0008/5263/85263v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,306],"assets/images/resized/0008/5263/85263v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0008/5264/85264v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,124],"assets/images/resized/0008/5264/85264v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,224],"assets/images/resized/0008/5264/85264v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/5265/85265v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0008/5265/85265v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,240],"assets/images/resized/0008/5265/85265v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.inc.com/howard-greenstein/the-small-business-web-leverage-and-cooperation.html","title":"Small Business Web: Leverage and Cooperation"},{"external_url":"http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/tips/archives/2010/04/social_media_fo.html","title":"Social Media for Small Business"},{"external_url":"http://smallbiztrends.com/2009/11/customer-relationship-management-with-a-social-media-twist-batchbook-review.html","title":"Customer Relationship Management with a Social Media Twist"}]}
