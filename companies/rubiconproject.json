Permission Control 2.0, within the Rubicon Projectâ€™s REVV for publishersâ„¢ advertising technology platform, is the infrastructure that gives premium publishers complete visibility and control over which demand partners can sell their inventory, at what level of transparency and at what price. With Permission Control 2.0 now in place, the company is also launching its real-time bidding (RTB) beta program with a limited number of industry-leading partners, designed to ensure publishers will be able to safely capture all potential ad revenue, from all buying methods.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the Permission Control 2.0 platform, publishers can view and manage sales rights and transparency across all demand sources (such as ad networks, exchanges, rep firms, other publishers, agency exchanges, DSPs) by geographic region, partner, site and most critically, price. By giving publishers complete control over how their inventory can be sold, and by whom, Permission Control 2.0 also empowers demand partners to gain transparent information about how they can access premium Web inventory on behalf of their advertisers.\r\n\r\nBy setting Permission Control 2.0 technology in place, publishers are assured they can safely capture money spent through all industry buying methods â€“ including real-time bidding (RTB), cookies, audience segments, content/contextual segments and site buys â€“ without putting their pricing and direct sales efforts at risk.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe market currently lacks rules around transactions between publishers, demand partners and their advertisers. This lack of clarity around the rules of engagement has led to price erosion, data leakage and channel conflict within the market,â€ said Craig Roah, COO and Founder of the Rubicon Project. â€œAs we work to create a fair marketplace, we are committed to providing publishers with transparent, efficient and safe access to all sources of demand to best monetize their ad inventory. Our team has dedicated thousands of hours developing the marketâ€™s first and only technology platform that ensures pricing protected by publisher-assigned sales rights, which gives publishers power and control over whoâ€™s allowed to sell their inventory, and how, around the world.â€\r\n\r\nPermission Control 2.0 delivers complete transparency, with features for publishers including:\r\n\r\nGlobal Rights Management: Control how inventory is sold all over the world by assigning sales rights, in addition to protecting pricing by country and region (for domestic and international territories);\r\nTransparency Settings: Manage the level of transparency at which each demand partner can sell inventory, by geography, site and ad size;\r\nPricing Controls: Unlock revenue potential and control the price at which demand partners can sell inventory, by geography, site and ad size;\r\nCommand Central Dashboard: View and manage permissions for all global sales partners and all the ways they can buy in a single dashboard.\r\nDemand-side platforms (DSPs), ad network and exchange partners who have agreed to the unique rules that protect publishers in the Rubicon Projectâ€™s RTB beta program include AppNexus, Brandscreen Inc., ContextWebâ€™s ADSDAQ Ad Exchange, CPX Interactive, DataXu, Invite Media, Infectious Media, LucidMedia, MediaMath, Triggit and Turn Inc. In concert with Permission Control 2.0, the RTB beta program makes REVV the only technology solution on that market that facilitates connection with such a large number of partners while ensuring the highest level of publisher protections, driven both by strict business rules and unparalleled technology.\r\n\r\nFor publishers interested in learning more about Permission Control 2.0, please send an email to events@rubiconproject.com to request an invite for a webinar on April 29 at 10am ET or 10am PT.\r\n","source_description":"THE RUBICON PROJECT LAUNCHES PERMISSION CONTROL 2.0 TO EMPOWER PUBLISHERS TO REGAIN BALANCE IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING ECOSYSTEM  ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"the Rubicon Project","permalink":"rubiconproject"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/hRbN8RIA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2008/09/advertising-net.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"},{"embed_code":"<div style=\"width:320px;\"><div style=\"background-color:#dedede;width:320px;text-align:center;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:5px;margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-10-13-despite-ad-downturn-rubicon-seeks-to-buy\" target=\"_blank\">See this video on <span style=\"color:#38538e;font-weight: bold;\">Vator</span><span style=\"color:#50a756;font-weight: bold;\">.tv</span>&nbsp;&raquo;</a></div><embed src=\"http://www.vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=4475_Rubicon-2-Vator-9-9-08.flv&b=2&i=4475&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-10-13-despite-ad-downturn-rubicon-seeks-to-buy\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></div>","description":"<p>Vator.tv Interview</p>"},{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/goRr6rtn1Ek%2Em4v\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed> ","description":"<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2009/04/rubicon-project-raises-13-million-war-chest-report.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"},{"embed_code":"<div style=\"width:320px;\"><div style=\"background-color:#dedede;width:320px;text-align:center;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:5px;margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://vator.tv/news/show/2008-06-08-vator-box-on-mobile-marketing-and-optimizing-ad-spend-rubicon-project-mozes\" target=\"_blank\">See this video on <span style=\"color:#38538e;font-weight: bold;\">Vator</span><span style=\"color:#50a756;font-weight: bold;\">.tv</span>&nbsp;&raquo;</a></div><embed src=\"http://vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=3336_vator-08-10-Vator-Box-2-MPEG-4-800Kbps.flv&b=2&i=3336&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://vator.tv/news/show/2008-06-08-vator-box-on-mobile-marketing-and-optimizing-ad-spend-rubicon-project-mozes\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></div>\r\n","description":"<p>VatorTV: 6/2008</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.examiner.com/x-4522-LA-Internet-Examiner~y2009m2d25-The-Rubicon-Project-releases-positive-Q4-report-for-web-publishers-and-ad-networks","title":"The Rubicon Project releases positive Q4 report for web publishers and ad networks"}]}
