Simple. Social.&#8221; community which leverages Facebook profiles to connect users based on interests and location.  </p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to provide what Facebook does not, help people communicate and make friends with people outside of their social circle.  Facebook is a great forum for talking to your friends, but it is difficult and awkward to meet new people within the Facebook community.  By leveraging the Facebook profiles through the Graph API, we can connect &#8220;real&#8221; people in a safe and easy to use way.  Profile names are masked, and all interests data can be controlled by the user.</p>\n\n<p>Conversations occur within FaceToFriend and when both parties are comfortable with sharing more they can open up their profile to the other party and they can initiate the request to become Facebook friends.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0018/9325/189325v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,29],"assets/images/resized/0018/9325/189325v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,53],"assets/images/resized/0018/9325/189325v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Gay","permalink":"scott-gay","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & COO","person":{"first_name":"Michelle","last_name":"Gay","permalink":"michelle-gay","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0018/9323/189323v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0018/9323/189323v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,346],"assets/images/resized/0018/9323/189323v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0018/9324/189324v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0018/9324/189324v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,346],"assets/images/resized/0018/9324/189324v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
