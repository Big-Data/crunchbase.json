Once inserted, ViewTracker provides similar user behavior information typically provided by web analytics tools,  but modified for the eBay platform. </p>\n\n<p>Such data includes whether the user was browsing or searching, if searching, which keyword was used to find an item, time spent looking at an item, whether the user is tracking the item in My eBay, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Sellathon was founded in 2003 by Wayne Yeager. The company was based in Lexington, Kentucky and had 4 employees.</p>\n\n<p>The company was acquired by Auctiva in December 2006, and as of August 2008 had transferred all operations to Chico, California. ViewTracker is now integrated into Auctiva&#8217;s listing software.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0003/8872/38872v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0003/8872/38872v1-max-250x250.png"],[[329,87],"assets/images/resized/0003/8872/38872v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Wayne","last_name":"Yeager","permalink":"wayne-yeager","image":{"available_sizes":[[[83,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/5466/25466v2-max-150x150.png"],[[83,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/5466/25466v2-max-250x250.png"],[[83,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/5466/25466v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Wayne Yeager / <a href=\"http://www.webalytics.com/\" title=\"Webalytics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webalytics</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y07/m01/i05/s01","source_description":"Auctiva Acquires Sellathon, Publisher of eBay Analytics Tool","acquired_year":2006,"acquired_month":12,"acquired_day":null,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Auctiva","permalink":"auctiva","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0003/0091/30091v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0003/0091/30091v2-max-250x250.png"],[[257,70],"assets/images/resized/0003/0091/30091v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":" 360 E. 6th Street","address2":"","zip_code":"95928","city":"Chico","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.7293,"longitude":-121.835193}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0003/8873/38873v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/8873/38873v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,289],"assets/images/resized/0003/8873/38873v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
