Started by Jonathan Abrams, founder of social network <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/friendster\" title=\"Friendster\">Friendster</a>, Socializr lets you share information about local parties, dinner or lunch get-togethers and any other type of event. Hopefully having learned much from Friendster&#8217;s inability to scale, Abrams&#8217; new project will have sturdier infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>When creating a personal profile users will supply their email addresses so that Socializr may search for any of their other online profiles and aggregate them. Info from <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace\" title=\"Myspace\">Myspace</a>, <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/flickr\" title=\"Flickr\">Flickr</a>, Friendster, <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> and other networks can be aggregated. Address and contact information can be aggregated from your email accounts as well. Unlike social networks like Facebook, Socializr incorporates email outside of its walls.</p>\n\n<p>Once all your social media is on Socializr you can easily send custom invite emails to your friends including photos, addresses, Maps and other media.</p>\n\n<p>Competitors include: Evite, <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/punchbowl\" title=\"Punchbowl\">Punchbowl</a>, SuggestLocal, Skobee
