This technology is being used to create new biofuel crops destined to serve the developing bio-energy market.</p>\n\n<p>Agrisomaâ€™s core technology is a proprietary method to introduce, express and manage new genes in plants.  Rather than randomly inserting the genes into a cropâ€™s genome as is currently done, Agrisomaâ€™s technology relies on engineering the crops genome to contain an â€œEngineered Trait Lociâ€ (ETL) that can accommodate an appropriate â€œdoseâ€ and â€œselectionâ€ of genes to reprogram the cropâ€™s biosynthetic activity. The ETL technology is particularly suited to introducing the multiple genes required to achieve enhanced production of biofuels.  The ETL technology also has applications for gene stacking. </p>\n\n<p>The company began operations in 2002 and has focused on the application of its technology into biofuel development since 2004.  Agrisoma has achieved critical milestones in the application of its technology in major oilseeds and biomass crops for the production of renewable fuels.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,54],"assets/images/resized/0004/9953/49953v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[127,54],"assets/images/resized/0004/9953/49953v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[127,54],"assets/images/resized/0004/9953/49953v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Fabijanski","permalink":"steven-fabijanski","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice-President, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Cuellar","permalink":"richard-cuellar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice-President, Technology Development","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Lindenbaum","permalink":"michael-lindenbaum","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.32M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":2320000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Business Development Bank of Canada","permalink":"business-development-bank-of-canada","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,95],"assets/images/resized/0004/9870/49870v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[131,95],"assets/images/resized/0004/9870/49870v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[131,95],"assets/images/resized/0004/9870/49870v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Calyx Bio-Ventures","permalink":"calyx-bio-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Canadian Medical Discoveries Fund","permalink":"canadian-medical-discoveries-fund","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"220-980 West 1st Street","address2":"","zip_code":"BC V7P 3N4","city":"North Vancouver","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":49.3181212,"longitude":-123.1017318}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0004/9952/49952v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0004/9952/49952v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,287],"assets/images/resized/0004/9952/49952v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
