The site has a stack of web app urls, and the application pings the site using the username you want to check, if it returns a &#8220;no user name&#8221; error it returns that. The site uses Dojo as it does all the checks using Ajax (each check takes a couple of seconds so using Ajax you don&#8217;t have to sit and wait 3 minutes for the page to load)</p>\n\n<p>In Feb 2009, upon hitting the 500,000 unique usernames checked, and after having over a million unique visitors, Jon Sykes took usernamecheck down, opened up the code in a post entitled &#8220;Behind the Curtain&#8221;.  Later he sold the domain for an undisclosed sum.</p>\n\n<p>via: <a href=\"http://www.usernamecheck.com/\" title=\"Usernamecheck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Usernamecheck</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0003/9773/39773v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,25],"assets/images/resized/0003/9773/39773v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,45],"assets/images/resized/0003/9773/39773v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Sykes","permalink":"jon-sykes","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5196/155196v2-max-150x150.png"],[[243,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5196/155196v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,308],"assets/images/resized/0015/5196/155196v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Barraud","permalink":"jim-barradu","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0003/9774/39774v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/9774/39774v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,288],"assets/images/resized/0003/9774/39774v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
