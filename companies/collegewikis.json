Since its launch last year, CollegeWikis has become the group messaging platform of choice for over 50,000 students in more than 200 colleges, with over 600,000 topics. </p>\n\n<p>On CollegeWikis, students can join groups for their school, courses, dorms, and more; then send and follow group messages to peers. Those messages then become wiki-editable pages on the site, providing information that is always accurate and searchable by others. </p>\n\n<p>The original idea for the site came from Founder Joe DiPasquale&#8217;s experience in business school. He told us: &#8220;We had an email list for our class year, through which hundreds of messages were sent per week. But students faced two problems: the absence of group lists that we really wanted, like for our dorm or courses; and all the great content sent out over the list was soon buried in peopleâ€™s email inboxes. CollegeWikis not only provides these groups but also captures their content.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0000/3805/3805v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[184,51],"assets/images/resized/0000/3805/3805v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[184,51],"assets/images/resized/0000/3805/3805v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"CollegeWikis","permalink":"collegewikis","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"DiPasquale","permalink":"joe-dipasquale","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,113],"assets/images/resized/0002/6033/26033v5-max-150x150.png"],[[86,113],"assets/images/resized/0002/6033/26033v5-max-250x250.png"],[[86,113],"assets/images/resized/0002/6033/26033v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Product","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Chase","permalink":"jeremy-chase","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Technology","person":{"first_name":"Aadi","last_name":"Deshpande","permalink":"aadi-deshpande","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2008/10/collegewikis_ra.html","source_description":"CollegeWikis Raises $2M","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":8,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"HighBAR Partners","permalink":"highbar-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/8110/28110v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/8110/28110v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/8110/28110v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Richmond Management","permalink":"richmond-management","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0002/8353/28353v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0002/8353/28353v2-max-250x250.png"],[[344,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/8353/28353v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The eCoast Angel Network","permalink":"the-ecoast-angel-network","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/1672/1672v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1672/1672v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1672/1672v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Boston Harbor Angels","permalink":"boston-harbor-angels","image":{"available_sizes":[[[83,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/8947/28947v1-max-150x150.png"],[[83,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/8947/28947v1-max-250x250.png"],[[83,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/8947/28947v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
