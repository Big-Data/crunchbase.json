It was founded soon after Erlang was released as open source in 1999, with an aim to fill a vacuum similar to that existing before companies such as SUSE and Redhat came in to support Linux. Our areas of operation include Training, Consulting, Contracting, Recruitment and System Development. We will soon provide commercial support licenses for the Open Source release, acting as first and second line support on behalf of Ericsson.</p>\n\n<p>Our main office is in central London, with a Swedish satellite office in Stockholm and a Polish office in Krakow. From these locations, we serve our clients who are spread on five continents. Our clients are universities, major multinational corporations, as well as small and medium-sized companies. It is a good match for Erlang Solutions&#8217;s staff, who represent seven nationalities and have no fear of flying.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, what brings us together is a passion for what we do, namely a good challenge involving distributed, massively concurrent soft real time systems&#8230; All done in Erlang.</p>\n\n<p>Erlang Solutions Ltd. is committed to protecting your privacy.
