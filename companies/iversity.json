Unlike Blackboard or Moodle, their approach is bottom up: anyone can sign up for free. </p>\n\n<p>iversity merges an online workspace with a social network. it provides tools for interaction and collaboration that standard e-learning systems do not provide (e.g. pdf-annotation). It is the first course-management platform that allows students and researchers to connect and collaborate, not just within courses, but also across institutional boundaries. iversity seeks to revive the original vision of the world wide web: to facilitate the exchange of knowledge within academia.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,34],"assets/images/resized/0010/7773/107773v3-max-150x150.png"],[[113,34],"assets/images/resized/0010/7773/107773v3-max-250x250.png"],[[113,34],"assets/images/resized/0010/7773/107773v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO (Managing Director)","person":{"first_name":"Jonas","last_name":"Liepmann","permalink":"jonas-liepmann","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO (Managing Director)","person":{"first_name":"Hannes","last_name":"Klöpper","permalink":"hannes-klpper","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€1.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.exist.de/","source_description":"EXIST","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/iversity-completes-2m-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"iversity Completes over $1,6 M Financing Round","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":11,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Office","address1":"Dahlwitzer Str. 78","address2":"","zip_code":"15366","city":"Neuenhagen bei Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0016/9269/169269v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0016/9269/169269v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,209],"assets/images/resized/0016/9269/169269v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
