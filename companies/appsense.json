This enables IT to standardize the desktop build, automate desktop and application delivery, and migrate users to new desktops all while ensuring the user experience is seamless, personal, predictable and easily manageable. </p>\n\n<p>This three-layer desktop model (OS, apps, user) provides economies of scale, as well as a more flexible, agile desktop estate. AppSense has been optimizing the desktop user experience for over ten years, and has developed the technology, experience and operational capacity to offer a solution to what has been to date the most challenging yet important aspect of the desktop to manage the
