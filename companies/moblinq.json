This is also the way to create a personal calendar that can be used at the event itself.</p>\n\n<p>MoblinQ is made for mobile use and is accessible from mobile phones and tablets through the browser.</p>\n\n<p>For Organizers</p>\n\n<p>After creating an event on MoblinQ organizers can choose to use MoblinQ as the main registration tool or simply invite visitors of their event to join their MoblinQ event community.</p>\n\n<p>Organizers can choose from various templates to accommodate different events such as a congress, fair, congress &amp; fair, music festival or art festival.
