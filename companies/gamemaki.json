Available on the web and mobile platform, users suggest activities to challenge their friends, and discover new experiences by accepting and doing other challenges.</p>\n\n<p>GameMaki focuses on facilitating sharing and discovering quality, crowdsourced suggestions. Users post suggestions as challenges (eg. &#8216;Quit smoking, go for Nicorette mint instead!&#8217;) that others may &#8216;accept&#8217;, &#8216;claim&#8217; and post relevant comments/photos. They may also rate the challenges for relevancy and meaningfulness. Game mechanics such as points and badges encourage core actions such as creating and fulfilling challenges.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0014/4973/144973v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0014/4973/144973v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0014/4973/144973v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CMO","person":{"first_name":"Brenda","last_name":"Nicole Tan","permalink":"brenda-nicole-tan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/5007/145007v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/5007/145007v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/5007/145007v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Brenda Nicole Tan/<a href=\"http://brendalogy.net\" title=\"Brendalogy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brendalogy</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Keith","last_name":"Ng","permalink":"keith-ng","image":{"available_sizes":[[[76,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/8367/168367v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[127,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/8367/168367v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,393],"assets/images/resized/0016/8367/168367v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Damon","last_name":"Widjaja","permalink":"damon-widjaja","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Designer","person":{"first_name":"Jesslyn","last_name":"Teo","permalink":"jesslyn-teo","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Observer","person":{"first_name":"Yinglan","last_name":"Tan","permalink":"yinglan-tan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1123/101123v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/1123/101123v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/1123/101123v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$100k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://sgentrepreneurs.com/2012/11/07/gametize/","source_description":"Profile and timeline of Gametize","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Crystal Horse Investments","permalink":"crystal-horse-investments-pte-ltd","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0016/2161/162161v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[218,111],"assets/images/resized/0016/2161/162161v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[218,111],"assets/images/resized/0016/2161/162161v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"29A Keong Saik Road","address2":"","zip_code":"089136","city":"Singapore","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1Bao9UDpea4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>GameMaki -
