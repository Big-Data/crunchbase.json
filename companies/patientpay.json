It saw that what was commonplace at retail and in e-commerce hadn&#8217;t been done for the healthcare industry and those it served.</p>\n\n<p>With headquarters in Durham, NC, the nexus of information and healthcare technology, Zepherella set out to develop an online payment process that could be instantly integrated with existing practice management systems used by most physician practices, hospitals and institutions across the United States.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, the company launched PatientPaySM, a secure, cloud-based service that drives down expense by eliminating the labor-intensive and error-prone manual, back-end effort to process paper bills or payments made on traditional online portals.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012 Zepherella was granted U.S. Patent No. 8,155,983 for its innovative process that underpins the PatientPay service and permits &#8216;Instant Integration&#8217; with all popular physician management and billing systems. This had accelerated Zepherella becoming a leader in the healthcare payments arena.</p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s customer base of revenue cycle management companies, PMS providers and physician offices continues to grow while it continues its mission of helping to make the financial side of healthcare easier for both patients and providers alike.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0013/5702/135702v7-max-150x150.png"],[[228,38],"assets/images/resized/0013/5702/135702v7-max-250x250.png"],[[228,38],"assets/images/resized/0013/5702/135702v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO / Founder","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Furr","permalink":"thomas-furr","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Intuit Healthcare Payments","permalink":"intuit-healthcare-payments","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"mPay Gateway","permalink":"mpay-gateway","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0003/2040/32040v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0003/2040/32040v1-max-250x250.png"],[[284,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/2040/32040v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.dealipedia.com/company_view.php?id=21399","source_description":"Angels","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":10,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1005 Slater Road","address2":"Suite 214","zip_code":"27703","city":"Durham","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Secured a partnership with LabCorp","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":22,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"PatientPay","permalink":"patientpay"}},{"description":"Zepherella Secures Patent","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":10,"source_url":"https://www.zepherella.com/newsitem201204","source_text":null,"source_description":"Zepherella Announces 'Instant Integration' for its Online Patient Payment Service","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"PatientPay","permalink":"patientpay"}},{"description":"Zepherella Secures Practice Management System Vendor","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"https://www.zeph-demo.com/newsitem3","source_text":null,"source_description":"AMS Software Adds Zepherella's PatientPay Service to its Physician Management Suite","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"PatientPay","permalink":"patientpay"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0013/5701/135701v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0013/5701/135701v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[450,271],"assets/images/resized/0013/5701/135701v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
