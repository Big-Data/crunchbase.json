That may be helping you trace your ancestors; capturing their stories in an unique book of your family&#8217;s history; or bringing you to Wales to walk in their footsteps.  Choose from any of these options to start an unforgettable journey.\nAt WHERE YOU&#8217;RE FROM we believe passionately that family history is aboutÂ storiesÂ rather than simply names and dates.  Thatâ€™s why we call ourselves family historians rather than genealogists. </p>\n\n<p>If its names and dates youâ€™re after, sure we can help.  But if you want to know where they lived, how they lived, and why they might have made those life-changing decisions, youâ€™ve come to the right place.  By combining knowledge of Welsh social history with genealogical and other records, we can paint the most vivid pictureÂ of your ancestorsâ€™ lives.</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™re also passionateÂ about all things Welsh and nothing makes us happier than showing people around the land of their fathers. </p>\n\n<p>If you have Welsh in your DNAÂ youâ€™ll want to understand the country in order to understand the people.  We have the oldest living language in Europe, an unique nomenclature, and downright weird social customs!   At WHERE YOU&#8217;RE FROM fromÂ we specialise only in Welsh family history.  Your familyâ€™s story is waiting to be told so contact us today.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,86],"assets/images/resized/0016/3793/163793v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[129,86],"assets/images/resized/0016/3793/163793v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[129,86],"assets/images/resized/0016/3793/163793v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Joanna","last_name":"masters","permalink":"joanna-masters","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"marketing services","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Masters Associates Limited","permalink":"masters-associates-limited","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"Mil Farm House","address2":"Abbey Road","zip_code":"CF35 5BN","city":"Ewenny","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
