The program consists of: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>an internship with a top startup, </li>\n<li>mentoring,</li>\n<li>a speaker series,</li>\n<li>company visits,</li>\n<li>interactive workshops,</li>\n<li>executive coaching,\nand more. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In its inaugural summer, CODE2040 fellows: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>met executives at tech powerhouses Google and Facebook, </li>\n<li>sat down with partners at top venture firms Kleiner Perkins and Greylock, </li>\n<li>were mentored by early employees at YouTube and Quora,</li>\n<li>worked at leading edge startups Tumblr and Jawbone,</li>\n<li>visited trendsetting companies Zynga and Square,</li>\n<li>presented an original engineering project to founders from around the Valley,\nand more. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summer 2013, CODE2040 will partner with dozens of Silicon Valley&#8217;s best companies to welcome 20 students into its career-launching fellows program. </p>\n\n<p>Why is CODE2040 important? Census projections show that people of color will collectively be the majority in the United States in the year 2040. Yet there is no indication that the substantial economic achievement gap is closing at the same rate. CODE2040 aims to make a direct impact on the gap by increasing the number of underrepresented minorities participating in and leading the high value, innovation economy - an economy centered in Silicon Valley.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Tristan","last_name":"Walker","permalink":"tristan-walker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0006/9451/69451v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0006/9451/69451v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[283,262],"assets/images/resized/0006/9451/69451v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founding Executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"Weidman Powers","permalink":"laura-weidman-powers","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0021/0387/210387v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,227],"assets/images/resized/0021/0387/210387v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,410],"assets/images/resized/0021/0387/210387v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Horowitz","permalink":"ben-horowitz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/4273/24273v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0002/4273/24273v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0002/4273/24273v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Andreessen Horowitz</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Bea","last_name":"Perez","permalink":"bea-perez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Hedlund","permalink":"marc-hedlund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9111/19111v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9111/19111v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9111/19111v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.wesabe.com/page/founders\" title=\"Wesabe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wesabe</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Amber","last_name":"Saloner Tennant","permalink":"amber-saloner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4312/214312v2-max-150x150.png"],[[169,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4312/214312v2-max-250x250.png"],[[305,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4312/214312v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94104","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
