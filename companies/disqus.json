The service offers a networked comment system used to foster engagement and connect audiences from around the web.</p>\n\n<p>Disqus looks to make it very easy and rewarding for people to interact on websites using its system. Commenters can build reputation and carry their contributions from one website to the next. Using the Disqus&#8217; built-in network effects, bloggers and publishers can expect a higher volume and higher quality of conversations by using the comment system.</p>\n\n<p>Disqus was founded in
