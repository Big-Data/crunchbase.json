The company holds a pending US patent on its fashion discovery process that profiles users’ actions and makes targeted product recommendations. </p>\n\n<p>The service has successfully launched in the Greek market since 2011 operating 7 co-branding solutions for publishers like Microsoft and Condé Nast. The team’s next target is the UK market with the newly launched Fashinating.co.uk</p>\n\n<p>The Problem </p>\n\n<p>Online fashion retail is the most popular category of e-shopping in many countries and the fastest growing in the US with growth of 20%. Markets like the UK offer an overwhelming choice to the online consumer. Just shopping for t-shirts on Amazon UK gives you a choice of over one million different options. If someone placed one t-shirt next to the other to help you decide you would have to walk 5 days non-stop to actually view them all! The problem here is clear, what is the best way to help you discover the perfect t-shirt?</p>\n\n<p>The Solution</p>\n\n<p>Fashinating makes real time recommendations based on the users’ instant choices and accumulated profile. This ensures that you see the best t-shirts out of the one million first! Others might claim the same, but who makes the best targeting? Even the perfect recommendation engine cannot function without taste data! The winner in this industry will be the one able to gather and utilize user data quickly. Fashinating’s patented process ensures visitors add on average 8 products to their favorites per visit! This ensures it selects the best t-shirts for you when at the same time it displays large pictures helping you make the right choice.</p>\n\n<p>Project Status</p>\n\n<p>The company has been funded to date by its founders’, select angels and the Openfund (http://theopenfund.com). All three original founders are dedicated full time to Fashinating since the formation of the company in 2010. </p>\n\n<p>The Greek market offering was launched in May 2011 and has close to 100K monthly visits (35% returning) that are driven mainly through its co-branding deals with portals like MSN.gr, Star.gr and Menshealth.gr. The UK version of the product started in summer 2012 and, using the same strategy, has just launched its first UK co-branding deal with HolyMoly.com. </p>\n\n<p>Fashinating today features over 130K products in its Greek and UK version. It also has over 250 agreements with eshops like GAP, Asos, Far Fetch, French Connection and Ted Baker - most of them for the UK and the US vertical.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0011/0786/110786v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0011/0786/110786v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,82],"assets/images/resized/0011/0786/110786v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ShopStyle","permalink":"shopstyle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0006/7312/67312v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[234,46],"assets/images/resized/0006/7312/67312v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[234,46],"assets/images/resized/0006/7312/67312v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Nuji","permalink":"nuji","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/1442/101442v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0010/1442/101442v8-max-250x250.png"],[[450,236],"assets/images/resized/0010/1442/101442v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"StyleFeeder","permalink":"stylefeeder","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0000/1606/1606v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/1606/1606v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/1606/1606v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Like.com","permalink":"like","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/0717/20717v1-max-150x150.png"],[[162,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/0717/20717v1-max-250x250.png"],[[162,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/0717/20717v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Pinterest","permalink":"pinterest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/4502/174502v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/4502/174502v6-max-250x250.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/4502/174502v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Lyst","permalink":"lyst","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0013/9344/139344v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0013/9344/139344v2-max-250x250.png"],[[388,147],"assets/images/resized/0013/9344/139344v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Empora","permalink":"empora","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0015/8717/158717v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,63],"assets/images/resized/0015/8717/158717v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[191,63],"assets/images/resized/0015/8717/158717v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Dressipi","permalink":"dressipi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0013/8037/138037v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0013/8037/138037v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,155],"assets/images/resized/0013/8037/138037v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€95k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"Various Investors","raised_amount":65000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://theopenfund.com","source_description":"The Openfund","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The Openfund","permalink":"the-openfund","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Received angel funding of 65K â‚¬","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":10,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Fashinating","permalink":"fashinating"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
