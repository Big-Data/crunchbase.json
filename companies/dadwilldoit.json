It also provides a 100% private sharing capability with family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>Organize once, use wherever, forever.</p>\n\n<p>Once installed on your computer DAD works feverishly behind the scenes to create a super index of your files, making hidden information about these files (often referred to as metadata) available for you to utilise. Using the DAD application you can enrich and organise your files with personal tags, comments and rules. Using DAD Secure Share you can even share your files privately with your friends and family across the web. </p>\n\n<p>If you have more than one computer in your home DAD can, if so asked, identify all your holiday photos stored on each computer and ensure these are all kept together to make a perfect family holiday album. All done automagically, without you having to waste a single second on organising.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7641/77641v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/7641/77641v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/7641/77641v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Ranger","permalink":"julian-ranger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JulianRanger</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Finance Director","person":{"first_name":"Roger","last_name":"Goscomb","permalink":"roger-goscomb","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Pascal","last_name":"Wheeler","permalink":"pascal-wheeler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Non-executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Anderson","permalink":"eric-anderson-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/4688/94688v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,247],"assets/images/resized/0009/4688/94688v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,247],"assets/images/resized/0009/4688/94688v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technical Director","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Corner","permalink":"chris-corner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Non-executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Hulme","permalink":"simon-hulme","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/4687/94687v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[174,238],"assets/images/resized/0009/4687/94687v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[174,238],"assets/images/resized/0009/4687/94687v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"Â£1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://jranger.com/J_Ranger_Ltd/iBundle.html","source_description":"iBundle/J Ranger Ltd","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Ranger","permalink":"julian-ranger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JulianRanger</p>"}}}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":750000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":4,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"The Reeds Business Park","address2":"","zip_code":"GU10 3BP","city":"Frensham","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ibundle.co.uk","title":"iBundle innovation hub"}]}
