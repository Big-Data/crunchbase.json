The company&#8217;s two main products today include the original BitTorrent software and the tiny-but-mighty µTorrent, which combined boast over 150+ million users. BitTorrent is based in San Francisco, Calif. and is backed by Accel Partners and DCM.</p>\n\n<p>BitTorrent is a globally-recognized creator of software and technology designed to help help people find, share and move digital media over the Internet. The company has built an orchestrated ecosystem of software, content and devices, all designed in harmony with the legendary BitTorrent protocol at the core. The BitTorrent Protocol, invented by founder Bram Cohen in 2001, makes massive files move efficiently over the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Software\nThe original BitTorrent and the iconic µTorrent are the world&#8217;s most popular torrent software clients. They make it fast and easy for people to find, download, share, and play large files over the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Content\nBitTorrent is currently building unique features to easily transform, play and share large personal media files (e.g. home movies, smartphone videos, and hi-res photos) with friends and on on BitTorrent partner devices. Through the Spotlight Artist program, users also have direct access to a library of artist-endorsed indie films, music, games and books.</p>\n\n<p>BitTorrent Certified Devices\nBitTorrent Certified devices extend the BitTorrent experience beyond the PC into the living room, home theaters, and smartphones. The BitTorrent Certified Devices Partner Program enables consumer electronics makers to join the BitTorrent community, reach a global audience, and solve fundamental user challenges with moving personal content to home devices.</p>\n\n<p>The BitTorrent Protocol\nThe global standard for delivering large files over the Internet. It enables faster file transfers by downloading pieces of a file from multiple sources and concurrently uploading pieces to other users, overcoming the asymmetrical nature of upstream and downstream bandwidth. Many companies, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Blizzard, leverage the BitTorrent protocol to make files move faster.</p>\n\n<p>µTP or micro-transport protocol\nµTP is an intelligent BitTorrent protocol engineered to self-throttle when sensing network congestion, yielding capacity to priority traffic. The result? BitTorrent does not contribute to congestion on home networks or global ISP backbones.</p>\n\n<p>BitTorrent also contributes through more broadly-focused standards bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) at the LEDBAT working group http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ledbat-charter.html.
