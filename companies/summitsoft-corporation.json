By late 2001, it seemed a natural step to expand into publishing. With Summitsoft&#8217;s extensive background and experience, the company achieved sensational growth, capturing an unshakable Top 10 position in business software sales for both the PC and Macintosh platforms. Fueled by successful partnerships with leading retailers, Summitsoft supports its strong distribution with products that show high sell-thru at retail, leading most NPD TechworldÂ® categories in rate-of-sale per outlet.</p>\n\n<p>Further heightening our success was the launch of Macware, Inc. in 2003, a Summitsoft company devoted to the interests of Macintosh users, which instantly attracted a wide audience in the Mac community. Macware is only eclipsed by three other giant publishers in the productivity category, and consistently holds Top positions in Mac business software.</p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s headquarters and primary distribution center are both centrally located in Omaha, Nebraska. Summitsoft products are available through major retailers in North America, as well as Australia, Japan, Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Since Summitsoft&#8217;s inception, it has continued on a path of delivering quality products and services to its customers. A commitment shared by all of its employees.</p>\n\n<p>Corporate Offices\nSummitsoft Corporation\n9615 Ida Street\nOmaha, NE 68122</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0003/1073/31073v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0003/1073/31073v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,144],"assets/images/resized/0003/1073/31073v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Logo Design Studio","permalink":"logo-design-studio","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"9615 Ida Street","address2":"","zip_code":"68122","city":"Omaha","state_code":"NE","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.3207132,"longitude":-96.0635225}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
