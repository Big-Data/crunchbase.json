On a more important level, we introduce communities to each other. Clients can choose their own level of integration: private networks operate internally and are ideal for organizations sharing sensitive or proprietary information; open networks are categorized and integrated by topic, allowing clients to reach out to a broader audience, generate more traffic and register new users.</p>\n\n<p>Who can benefit from a social network?\nCompanies\nGovernments\nBrands\nNGOs\nSchools\nInterest groups\nChurches\nUnions\nMusicians\nDevelopers\nArtists\nEntrepreneurs\nSports franchises\nHousing management\nYour neighbour\nOr anyone building of the\n600,000 sites that goes online everyday</p>\n\n<p>Examples: </p>\n\n<p>Multinational corp, communicate more efficiently, top-down, bottom-up, Bangkok to Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>Sports clubs can interact with fans, sell tickets, provide a place for discussion, (top level, down)</p>\n\n<p>What problem do we solve?</p>\n\n<p>AppLaunch gives clients direct access to their own communities without relying on other platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) or consenting to third-party Terms and Conditions. Clients &#8220;own&#8221; their members and use the power of social networking to manage their brand and maximize profits.</p>\n\n<p>The integration makes it easier to start a community from nothing.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have a user base, AppLaunch makes it easier to manage the community and tighten the community.</p>\n\n<p>How are we disruptive?</p>\n\n<p>Just as WordPress and Blogspot have led the publishing revolution, AppLaunch revolutionizes social networking by putting the power of social media back into the hands of brands, enterprises, organizations, entrepreneursâ€”anyone seeking to control their online social presence.</p>\n\n<p>The untapped applications of social technology\nextend far beyond socializing.</p>\n\n<p>Why would clients want their own social network?\nBrand control\nBrand loyalty\nEmployee productivity\nInformation flow\nCustomer knowledge and interaction\nExtreme analytics\nInformed decision making\nSmarter allocation of resources\nDiscovery of new business opportunities\nIndependence from third party sites\nMaximized profits</p>\n\n<p>Facebook knows a lot about their customers, now everyone can.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Kent","last_name":"Loset","permalink":"kent-loset","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6223/156223v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/6223/156223v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/6223/156223v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Joakim","last_name":"Lund Rangel","permalink":"joakim-lund-rangel-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[88,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6221/156221v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[147,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/6221/156221v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,338],"assets/images/resized/0015/6221/156221v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Developer","person":{"first_name":"Ole","last_name":"Marius Loset","permalink":"ole-marius-loset","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6222/156222v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/6222/156222v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/6222/156222v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Ning.com","permalink":"ning-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Suite D9/F One Capital Place","address2":"18 Luard Rd Wanchai","zip_code":"","city":"Hong Kong","state_code":null,"country_code":"HKG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/29655173?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=1\" width=\"449\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/29655173\">AppLaunch</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/applaunch\">AppLaunch ASIA Ltd</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>","description":"<p>AppLaunch platform demo</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
