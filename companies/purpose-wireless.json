create and develop cutting edge smartphone solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s first product, an open API, cross-platform, carrier agnostic location sharing system called echoecho, is primed to be a market leader in the location based services sector.  </p>\n\n<p>echoecho is confident that the ability to safely, simply and quickly share location with friends, family or business colleagues is a real problem that many users find themselves facing.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Where is John?&#8221;\n&#8220;Where is my girlfriend?&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m running late but I&#8217;d like to show you where I am located.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>echoecho seeks to continue redefining location sharing technology - and its uptake within and beyond the early adopter markets - by focusing on simplicity - rather than adding complexity.</p>\n\n<p>Since we figure we solved the problems of privacy, permission and preference inherent in location sharing very elegantly - we thought we&#8217;d add some more use cases into the mix - so users can now chat and find+share meeting places in 2 clicks.\nIn the latest version of the software we also added a feature we call LIVE - essentially a short term 2-way real-time link between friends - it works very well and it&#8217;s perfect for organising vehicle pickups (carpooling, dropping off and picking up friends etc)</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0007/7520/77520v3-max-150x150.png"],[[226,35],"assets/images/resized/0007/7520/77520v3-max-250x250.png"],[[226,35],"assets/images/resized/0007/7520/77520v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"echoecho","permalink":"echoecho","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder,
