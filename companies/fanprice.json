Also, if you have no idea how much should you pay there is a â€œGet User Suggested Priceâ€ tool that can point you in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>The site also features an artist search that will let you look up not only artists and teams but also specific events, whereas a â€œBrowse Ticketsâ€ category is included. This is broken into different categories such as â€œNFLâ€, â€œMLBâ€ and â€œNCAAâ€ along with â€œTheatreâ€ and â€œConcertsâ€. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/5989/25989v3-max-150x150.png"],[[196,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/5989/25989v3-max-250x250.png"],[[196,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/5989/25989v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Katz","permalink":"scott-katz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jaseem","last_name":"Masood","permalink":"jaseem-masood","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP of Product and Operations","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Hickson","permalink":"chris-hickson","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Berman","permalink":"jeff-berman-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Ticketmaster","permalink":"ticketmaster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/0755/10755v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/0755/10755v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/0755/10755v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Ace Ticket","permalink":"ace-ticket","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/1787/21787v1-max-150x150.png"],[[111,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/1787/21787v1-max-250x250.png"],[[111,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/1787/21787v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Viagogo","permalink":"viagogo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/4075/4075v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,102],"assets/images/resized/0000/4075/4075v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[309,127],"assets/images/resized/0000/4075/4075v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"LiveStub","permalink":"livestub","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/6222/26222v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[207,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/6222/26222v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[207,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/6222/26222v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"FanPrice Corporate Office","address1":"11693 San Vicente Blvd ","address2":"#425","zip_code":"90049","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.233786,"longitude":-122.636071}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
