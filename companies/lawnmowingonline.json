Consumers place an order on the website which is then sent to hundreds of local contractors who decide if they are available or want the job.  A contractor accepts the job, does the work and sends proof (photographs) that the job was completed.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone can sign-up to be a contractor on the website as long as they can provide the proper equipment.  </p>\n\n<p>LawnMowingOnline currently offers services in St. Louis, Houston and Miami and paid nearly $50,000 to lawn mowers in 2010 and saved consumers over $20,000.  Although only accepting lawn mowing jobs at this time LawnMowingOnline plans on expanding into other job fields in 2011.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0502/110502v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0502/110502v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0502/110502v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Hassinger","permalink":"james-hassinger","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"204A West Pitman Street","address2":"","zip_code":"63366","city":"O'Fallon","state_code":"MO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4z0meF-_b1I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4z0meF-_b1I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>A day with a LawnMowingOnline mower</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
