Zinch aims to give every student an equal opportunity to say, â€œThis is me. Love me, hate me, recruit me, or trash me. This is who I am.â€</p>\n\n<p>Students place their profiles on Zinch (with an emphasis on the non-transcript stuff that schools try so hard to uncover for best matching), and the colleges search for them, rather than vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>via: <a href=\"http://www.zinch.com/static/history.html\" title=\"Zinch\"
