Wavii accomplishes this with proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology that reads articles and blogs across the web, de-duplicates each story, and figures out what&#8217;s happening with these topics. For example, a political victory, breakup, acquisition, or new product release. </p>\n\n<p>In the same way that people use Facebook to follow friends, Wavii allows you to follow the topics you care about.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0009/4524/94524v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0009/4524/94524v3-max-250x250.png"],[[280,107],"assets/images/resized/0009/4524/94524v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
