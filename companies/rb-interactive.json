The Tournament is a game structure used for example in online poker and which places all participants on an absolutely equal footing.</p>\n\n<p>After several months observing the various online reverse auction websites, we came to a clear conclusion: playing on a reverse auction site can be an expensive business.<br/>\nWhy? Because when a player has to pay for each bid placed, the costs mount up very fast.   </p>\n\n<p>So we put our minds to creating a concept that would allow everyone to participate in reverse auctions for a very reasonable outlay.  </p>\n\n<p>SitnBid.com is the result of all our hard thinking.   </p>\n\n<p>We chose the name SitnBid.com because the concept we offer is very similar to the type of game you find on online poker sites: sit-n-go. When you play on SitnBid.com, you donâ€™t pay each time you place a bid: you only pay to access the auction. This principle allows you to play within your own personal limits and avoid running up excessive costs. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/5574/95574v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0009/5574/95574v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/5574/95574v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"winnit.com","permalink":"winnit-com","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"thesmartbid.com","permalink":"thesmartbid-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
