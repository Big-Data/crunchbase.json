Technology professionals are still making purchasing decisions based primarily upon information with a vendor bias from analysts, consultants and media sites. What is sorely missing is the ability to connect with other real users to get the “real deal” before making a purchasing decision.</p>\n\n<p>IT Central Station is a disruptive community site that finally enables technology professionals (in Global 2000 and mid-market enterprises) to research and share information, including product reviews, ratings and recommendations. We are &#8220;The Yelp of enterprise technology products.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The power of user-generated content will displace analyst firms as the primary influence of where the dollars are spent in this $3 trillion annual business. There are startups that are doing something similar for the SMB market but the enterprise market has unique requirements such as trusted anonymity, user validation, private messaging, and content sharing that IT Central Station has addressed.</p>\n\n<p>IT Central Station was launched in September 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0018/6367/186367v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0018/6367/186367v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,64],"assets/images/resized/0018/6367/186367v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Russell","last_name":"Rothstein","permalink":"russell-rothstein-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/6987/136987v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[239,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/6987/136987v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[431,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/6987/136987v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Naftali","last_name":"Marcus","permalink":"naftali-marcus","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"US Headquarters","address1":"244 5th Avenue","address2":"Suite R-230","zip_code":"10001","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"55 Nahal Sorek Street","address2":"","zip_code":"71707","city":"Modiin","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QmYHdo1Mhs4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>IT Central Station Overview</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0018/6365/186365v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0018/6365/186365v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,351],"assets/images/resized/0018/6365/186365v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0018/6366/186366v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0018/6366/186366v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,351],"assets/images/resized/0018/6366/186366v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
