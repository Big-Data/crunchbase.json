They can embed for example a video within an advertisement. This video can be played within a advertisement and can be for example the TV spot of this advertiser. Now the sales team can present the full magazine on the iPad with the TV spot in the magazine live to the ad client. This is so much more efficient in sales than any power point presentation or any paper presentation. </p>\n\n<p>The sales team can effectively present the full magazine to the advertisement client as it is available to the readers plus that this one issue has additional videos, web links and can have even additional pages - all to support this particular ad. The PadPublisher provides the publisher not only a smooth and effective way to publish his magazines on the iPad but also provides the publisherâ€™s sales team the most powerful presentation tool ever! </p>\n\n<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joC4sjHZRjQ</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0011/0567/110567v2-max-150x150.png"],[[221,60],"assets/images/resized/0011/0567/110567v2-max-250x250.png"],[[221,60],"assets/images/resized/0011/0567/110567v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"PadPublisher","permalink":"padpublisher","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Adobe Systems","permalink":"adobe-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[56,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/3687/13687v1-max-150x150.png"],[[56,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/3687/13687v1-max-250x250.png"],[[56,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/3687/13687v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Quark Xpress","permalink":"quark-xpress","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Woodwing","permalink":"woodwing","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Xyhoc0FGrec\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.851padpublisher.com/en","title":"PadPublisher"}]}
