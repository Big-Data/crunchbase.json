Content and offers online include places of interest, events, vaccination, visa and health requirements, activities, hotels and flights. Trip planning tools include a customizable trip agenda, map of the destination and easy ways to invite trip participants or share with friends.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s more to Travellution than just trip planning though, as our site allows you to connect with other users who are planning to go to the same destination at the same time as you. Our &#8220;Follow&#8221; functionality allows you to find people with similar or interesting trips and share in their travels online.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Travellution believes that we have a responsibility towards society and our planet. Travellution will help preserve cultural and natural diversity that is the driving force behind travel. Travellution will invest part of its profits into NGOs and social businesses that are active in preserving this diversity, serving to reinforce the brand and the public perception of Travellution. The Travellution Ethical Model proposes a new economic alternative, that is both sustainable and ethical for society.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0016/4375/164375v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0016/4375/164375v2-max-250x250.png"],[[283,80],"assets/images/resized/0016/4375/164375v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Giacomo","last_name":"Bastianelli","permalink":"giacomo-bastianelli","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Rider","permalink":"john-rider","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Yannick","last_name":"Thirion","permalink":"yannick-thirion","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬410k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":310000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Travellution Offices","address1":"80 rue des Haies","address2":"","zip_code":"75020","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/iDpXin-Pusk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>The Travel Sound Experiment</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0016/4376/164376v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/4376/164376v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0016/4376/164376v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blog.travellution.com","title":"Blog"}]}
