The standard post mode is very simple, pretty much like an IRC chat. For more options, simply switch to &#8216;extended post&#8217;. This will give you text format features, video embedding and picture upload.</p>\n\n<p>Users at Qvaq can also start a private chat with any other member. Chat contacts are listed in your personal menu, along with the groups you have joined.</p>\n\n<p>The site is created, without funding, by Martin Lindkvist and Robert Birming from Stockholm, Sweden. The development is literally taking place in Martin&#8217;s living room (see attached photo).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0010/5728/105728v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,144],"assets/images/resized/0010/5728/105728v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,260],"assets/images/resized/0010/5728/105728v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Birming","permalink":"robert-birming","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Executive Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Lindkvist","permalink":"martin-lindkvist","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Twitter","permalink":"twitter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"IRC","permalink":"irc","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/dHC2VPjHbWI?fs=1&amp;hl=sv_SE&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/dHC2VPjHbWI?fs=1&amp;hl=sv_SE&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"295\"></embed></object> ","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0010/5724/105724v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0010/5724/105724v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,355],"assets/images/resized/0010/5724/105724v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0010/5725/105725v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0010/5725/105725v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0010/5725/105725v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0010/5726/105726v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0010/5726/105726v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0010/5726/105726v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0010/5727/105727v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,183],"assets/images/resized/0010/5727/105727v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,330],"assets/images/resized/0010/5727/105727v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHC2VPjHbWI","title":"Qvaq video introduction"},{"external_url":"http://www.youngupstarts.com/2010/09/30/chatting-up-with-qvaq/","title":"Interview with co-founder Robert Birming"}]}
