This means people look for work longer, companies move slower, and products and services that we all want don&#8217;t get delivered. Recruiting costs $400 billion per year and there&#8217;s ample room to make it better. Connectifier is committed to getting people in jobs faster, and driving the economy forward.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Jersin","permalink":"john-jersin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"McCann","permalink":"benjamin-mccann","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Farooq","last_name":"Mela","permalink":"farooq-mela","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
