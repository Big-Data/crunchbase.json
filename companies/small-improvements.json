The focus is to making great teams awesome, by helping employees provide and receive feedback that actually helps them improve.</p>\n\n<p>The pillar of Small Improvements is a lightweight performance review solution. It focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and on an absence of charts and ratings. While the best feedback is delivered face to face, the software helps managers and employees compile the self-evaluation and performance assessments, prepare it, wrap it up and sign it. </p>\n\n<p>The core performance review module is enhanced by a 360 degree feedback platform, by continuous feedback, kudos and suggestions, and by lightweight goals and objective management. </p>\n\n<p>The company is still in startup mode, but has attracted a couple of interesting initial reference customers like Atlassian and CustomWare.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0013/2307/132307v2-max-150x150.png"],[[226,61],"assets/images/resized/0013/2307/132307v2-max-250x250.png"],[[226,61],"assets/images/resized/0013/2307/132307v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Per","last_name":"Fragemann","permalink":"per-fragemann","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/2306/132306v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/2306/132306v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/2306/132306v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"Kappeler","permalink":"matthias-kappeler-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.small-improvements.com","title":"Small Improvements"}]}
