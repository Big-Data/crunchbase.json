million for the six months ended September 30, up from $38.4 million the year prior.\r\n    * Net income in the same period was $3 million, down from $5.4 million the year prior.\r\n    * Operating

game sites that draws 4.4 million uniques, most of whom are not subscribers.\r\n    * Gamefly has penetrated a tiny portion of the video game market (~1%), so it sees room for growth.\r\n    * Subscriptions to Gamefly start at $15.95 per month.\r\n    * Money raised from the IPO will go towards towards general corporate purposes.\r\n    * David Hodess, CEO and President of Gamefly, was paid
