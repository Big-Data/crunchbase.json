As devices are now inter-connected and location-aware, digital serv-ices provide an opportunity to integrate computing use into a 24 hour lifestyle. WideTag takes advantage of this opportu-nity to sell applications and hardware ex-tensions that radically ehance the usersÊ¼ experience with their surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced mobile devices natively lay out a sensor network of hundreds of millions of points. WideTag developed and released an open source communications protocol called OpenSpime, a robust start-ing point for an application ecosystem. Its own hardware and software products, sold to speciï¬c target markets, will later be opened up to developers for further extension.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/1148/41148v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/1148/41148v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/1148/41148v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"OpenSpime","permalink":"openspime","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Leandro","last_name":"AgrÃ²","permalink":"leandro-agr","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Ostinelli","permalink":"roberto-ostinelli-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8066/128066v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/8066/128066v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/8066/128066v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Ostinelli","permalink":"roberto-ostinelli","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Interaction Designer & Developer","person":{"first_name":"Davide","last_name":"Casali","permalink":"davide-casali","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/5873/55873v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/5873/55873v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/5873/55873v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Davide Casali / <a href=\"http://intenseminimalism.com\" title=\"IntenseMinimalism\" rel=\"nofollow\">IntenseMinimalism</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Evangelist","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Orban","permalink":"david-orban","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2716/82716v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2716/82716v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/2716/82716v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David Orban / (http://www.davidorban.com)</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"370 Convention Way","address2":"","zip_code":"94063","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.494561,"longitude":-122.229097},{"description":"Development Center","address1":"C/O Top-ix Development Center","address2":"Via Bogino 9 ","zip_code":"10123","city":"Torino","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0004/1149/41149v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0004/1149/41149v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0004/1149/41149v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blogs.cisco.com/virtualworlds/comments/designing_the_shape_of_space_time","title":"Designing the Shape of Space And Time"},{"external_url":"http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3587.html","title":""}]}
