Nimbus has established a first-of-its-kind partnership with SchrÃ¶dinger, the leader in computational drug discovery, to gain privileged access to cutting-edge technology and exclusive rights to key targets.  Nimbus has already delivered selective, potent, and differentiated compounds within the first year for two disease targets that are pivotal in the progression of an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma and obesity, respectively.  Nimbus has built a virtually integrated, globally distributed R&amp;D organization that leverages an experienced internal drug discovery team across an external network of R&amp;D partners.  The resulting organization is scalable, capital efficient and has attracted world-class talent.  Nimbus seeks to partner its programs with larger pharmaceutical companies early in the development process allowing Nimbus to focus on its competitive advantage in novel drug discovery.  Nimbus programs are held in target-specific subsidiaries under an LLC umbrella.  Nimbus Discovery was founded in 2009 by Atlas Venture and SchrÃ¶dinger, Inc.  In 2010, Nimbus received three Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project Tax Credit (QTDP) grants for its programs. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,110],"assets/images/resized/0012/5898/125898v1-max-150x150.png"],[[148,110],"assets/images/resized/0012/5898/125898v1-max-250x250.png"],[[148,110],"assets/images/resized/0012/5898/125898v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$24M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.nimbusdiscovery.com/index.php?id=68","source_description":"NIMBUS DISCOVERY UNVEILS FIRST OF ITS KIND DRUG DISCOVERY PARADIGM; ANNOUNCES SEED ROUND CO-LED BY BILL GATES","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Gates","permalink":"bill-gates-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Friesner","permalink":"richard-friesner","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Atlas Venture","permalink":"atlas-venture","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2011/06/28/nimbus-seeded-by-bill-gates-raises-24-million-for-computer-aided-drug-discovery/","source_description":"Nimbus, Seeded by Bill Gates, Raises $24 Million For Computer-Aided Drug Discovery","raised_amount":24000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":28,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Atlas Venture","permalink":"atlas-venture","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Lilly Ventures","permalink":"lilly-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0005/5135/55135v2-max-150x150.png"],[[184,98],"assets/images/resized/0005/5135/55135v2-max-250x250.png"],[[184,98],"assets/images/resized/0005/5135/55135v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SR One","permalink":"sr-one","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0004/8794/48794v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/8794/48794v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/8794/48794v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"25 First Street","address2":"Suite 303","zip_code":"02141 ","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
