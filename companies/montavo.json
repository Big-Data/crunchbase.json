The Montavo ad platform offers advertisers the unique opportunity to review a “ad spend to gross profit” ratio gauge (the Ad Spendometer) which generates and displays a Return-on-Investment report of their brick-&amp;-mortar stores (not just their on-line store) sales revenue &amp; profits specifically attributed &amp; correlated to their advertising costs (smart phones, tables, lap tops, &amp; TV). This means advertisers know in real-time for every dollar they spend in advertising on the Montavo ad platform (or any ad platform that has added the Montavo advertising technology &amp; Ad Spendometer logo to their solution), how many dollars came back including brick-&amp;-mortar store sales revenue &amp; profits specifically related to their ad spend.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0021/8575/218575v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0021/8575/218575v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,135],"assets/images/resized/0021/8575/218575v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
