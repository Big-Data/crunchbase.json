Mobility Platform","created_at":"Wed Sep 19 15:45:49 UTC 2012","updated_at":"Mon Oct 08 09:32:41 UTC 2012","overview":"<p>StarMobile provides a cloud-based solution which allows companies to mobilize their enterprise applications (e.g. SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, Infor, salesforce.com, Workday, etc., or bespoke) at a fraction of the initial cost of investment, time to value and total cost of ownership as compared to any MEAP, MCAP or MADP. </p>\n\n<p>Enterprise Mobility platforms today present a fundamental problem - the scope, time, resources and cost to &#8220;mobilize&#8221; enterprise applications can actually exceed that required to originally implement those enterprise applications. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Mobilize your enterprise applications in hours or days as compared to months, for a few dollars per user as compared to hundreds or thousands. </p></li>\n<li><p>Directly leverages existing investments in data logic, workflow and use cases without having to recreate or rebuild them for mobile users. </p></li>\n<li><p>Requires no modification to the existing enterprise application. </p></li>\n<li><p>Uses existing network security and single sign-on, does not require company to re-license enterprise applications for mobile users. </p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancements to enterprise applications flow seamlessly out to mobile users without the need to update interfaces, middleware, APIs or native apps. </p></li>\n<li><p>Mobilization can be implemented and maintained by resources with basic admin skills as compared to exotic and expensive UI or native mobile device development skills, hence mobilization can be done at the line of business, departmental or functional level. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Emerging from &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; in early
