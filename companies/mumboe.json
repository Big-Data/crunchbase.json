By handling contracts only (and not e-signatures) the service competes with Spain-based <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/negonation\" title=\"NegoNation\">NegoNation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Mumboe application offers a full set of contract management capabilities, including a secure contract repository, an agreement template library, alerts and reminders, and a full audit trail of agreement changes and revisions. In addition, Mumboeâ€™s encrypted, password protected accounts and permission-based security give users complete control of their contract data.</p>\n\n<p>Once a document is uploaded into Mumboe, specific details such as responsible parties, effective dates and renewal dates, and the agreement terms and scope, can be automatically extracted from the document. Extracted information can be edited and saved, making it easy for users to quickly search and retrieve the data when needed. To verify data accuracy, users can view an excerpt of the text from which the data was extracted, or click on a hyperlink to jump directly to the place in the source document where the data originated. </p>\n\n<p>Mumboe is targeted at â€œcorporate consumers,â€ including small and growing businesses, as well as enterprise departments and workgroups, that need a simple, affordable way to manage their business agreements. Interested customers can &#8220;try before they buy&#8221; by registering for a free Mumboe 30-Day Free Trial account on the mumboe.com web site and get immediate, no-commitment access to the product and no credit card required. </p>\n\n<p>Mumboe introduced its on-demand contract management application in March, 2008. Since then, over 10,000 users have registered for a Mumboe account. Customers range from small businesses and nonprofit organizations to well-known corporate brands such as Register.com and Lionel LLC, the popular model train manufacturer.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3235/3235v1-max-150x150.png"],[[148,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3235/3235v1-max-250x250.png"],[[148,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3235/3235v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"R.
