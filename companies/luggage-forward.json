Luggage Forward rates are unique in the shipping industry due to the absence of hidden fees or added surcharges. Convenient categories are used to determine the size of each bag, so there is no need to weigh or measure it before booking.</p>\n\n<p>The door-to-door service saves travelers time at the airport and provides a stress-free travel experience, so they may:\n· Avoid carrying luggage or sports equipment to and from the\nairport. Luggage or sports equipment is left at the front door\nand delivered to the destination. Travelers no longer have to haul heavy bags or cumbersome sports equipment with them.\n· Bypass check-in lines. Eliminate the most frustrating part of air travel - waiting in long check-in lines. Luggage Forward allows travelers to save time by going directly to the gate.\n· Don&#8217;t pay unpredictable checked baggage fees. Recently, many airlines have implemented fees for checking luggage, which can add hundreds of dollars to the original ticket price.\n· Eliminate the possibility of the airline losing luggage. Whereas airlines specialize in transporting people, Luggage Forward specializes in transporting luggage, backing its reliability with the most comprehensive loss, damage and on time guarantee in the luggage forwarding industry.\n· Skip the wait at baggage claim. Go directly from the plane to the airport exit without wasting time at baggage claim.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0018/1550/181550v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,184],"assets/images/resized/0018/1550/181550v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,332],"assets/images/resized/0018/1550/181550v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Kirley","permalink":"aaron-kirley","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Zeke","last_name":"Adkins","permalink":"zeke-adkins","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":12,"acquired_day":29,"company":{"name":"The Luggage Club","permalink":"the-luggage-club","image":null}},{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":10,"company":{"name":"Ship Luggage","permalink":"ship-luggage","image":null}},{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":27,"company":{"name":"Virtual Bellhop","permalink":"virtual-bellhop","image":null}},{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":27,"company":{"name":"Luggage Express","permalink":"luggage-express","image":null}},{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":27,"company":{"name":"Sports Express","permalink":"sports-express","image":null}},{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":15,"company":{"name":"Baggage Quest","permalink":"baggage-quest","image":null}}],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"35 Kingston Street, Suite One","address2":"","zip_code":"02111","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2011/industry/travel","title":"Top Travel Companies on the Inc. 5000"},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/travel/31praccarryon.html?pagewanted=1&src=twt&twt=nytimestravel","title":"Gaming the Luggage System"},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/business/smallbusiness/30sbiz.html","title":"Partnerships Based on Service, Not Size"},{"external_url":"http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2008/12/baggage_fees_of.html","title":"Baggage fees offer opportunity for Hub firm "}]}
