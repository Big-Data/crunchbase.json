No, it’s not another todo list application; I promise. It’s for every other kind of list. Lists of people, places, and things. It’s for lists of websites, collections of images, top 10 lists, and packing lists. It’s for lists of instructions and directions and information you’re tired of giving out over and over again. It’s for recipes, agendas, key notes, study guides, college courses, personal inventories, songs you want to buy, lines in a blog that made you go aha!, moodboards, reasons, and pros and cons. It’s for lists of lists and lists of anything and everything. The list goes on and on.</p>\n\n<p>ltlsts lists are shareable and embeddable. No sign up is required to start listing immediately. </p>\n\n<p>Make a list, share a list, find a list, make it your own.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/9694/189694v2-max-150x150.png"],[[160,160],"assets/images/resized/0018/9694/189694v2-max-250x250.png"],[[160,160],"assets/images/resized/0018/9694/189694v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"owner, founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Nathan","permalink":"lee-nathan","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
