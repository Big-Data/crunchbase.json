An additional ten cities nationwide will be added throughout 2011. Through smart crowdsourcing and strategic partnerships, the guides provide fingertip access to everything living, working, playing and shopping - from local missing person notices to ticket giveaways to local attractions. The business and shopping directories provide free listings to local businesses and affordable marketing options to reach thousands of users.</p>\n\n<p>The Small Business App development program was launched in May, 2011, with the first series of customized apps expected in July, 2011, providing affordable, customized apps for businesses including restaurants, hotels, boutique shops, spas, and health clubs with options including interactive menus complete with in-app ordering, appointment calendars, in-app videos, photos, social media and more. The first app, a special events app for TEDxABQ, was released on August 11, 2011 for free download in the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch and added to the APPCityLife iPhone app the same week, providing a proof of concept for the patented technology of launching the mobile app from multiple configurations. </p>\n\n<p>Current Beta App clients include City of Albuquerque BioPark, AlluraDerm Medi Spa, Roadrunner Food Bank, Anderson School of Management - University of New Mexico, Tours of Old Town, Garrity Group, Mean 1 Boxing Gym, Bookworks and more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1949/141949v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[234,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/1949/141949v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[422,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/1949/141949v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President, Founder","person":{"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"Abeyta","permalink":"lisa-abeyta","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Operations","person":{"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"Adkins","permalink":"lisa-adkins","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Home Office","address1":"PO Box 93242","address2":"","zip_code":"87199","city":"Albuquerque","state_code":"NM","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Released first Beta Client Small Business App for TEDxABQ, featured both in the Apple App Store and in the APPCityLife iPhone App CityLifeâ„¢ guide for Albuquerque.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":16,"source_url":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tedxabq/id456147252?mt=8","source_text":null,"source_description":"TEDxABQ App","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"APPCityLife","permalink":"appcitylife"}},{"description":"Released APPCityLife's first app from our Beta Client Small Business App program.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":16,"source_url":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tedxabq/id456147252?mt=8","source_text":null,"source_description":"TEDxABQ App","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"APPCityLife","permalink":"appcitylife"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1948/141948v2-max-150x150.png"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/1948/141948v2-max-250x250.png"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/1948/141948v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://youtu.be/ZlkOpB2qL1I","title":"Local TV News Story"}]}
