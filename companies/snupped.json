The first Snupped laptop sleeve was born after we took apart a curtain and made it into a laptop sleeve. The rest is as they say, history. </p>\n\n<p>All Snupped cases are hand made and each Snupped case that leaves our hands is never the same as its older siblings. Instead of being mass manufactured by a machine in an offshore factory, our cases are handmade by real people, custom tailored to fit your laptop perfectly.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Russia & CIS Branch","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Moscow","state_code":null,"country_code":"RUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
