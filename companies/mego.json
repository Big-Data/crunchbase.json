The online profiles display user-picked content like profile details, videos, photos, feeds, and widgets. When you update your profile on mEgo it updates your avatar profile on all your online properties. This will allow people to have one consistent, updated profile as they join, enhance and migrate from social network to social network. </p>\n\n<p>mEgo founder Ariel McNichol previously created popular software, games, and mobile products for Yahoo, AOL, Lucas Arts and Disney, and her co-founder Julia Johnston was a &#8220;lawyer and highly accomplished business strategist in the technology, media and telecommunication industries.&#8221; Ariel started working on prototypes for creating, managing and updating online profiles back in 1999. Their new online profile avatar mEgo&#8217;s revenue model consists of a blend of advertising, sponsorship, referral revenue and ecommerce.  In addition, mEgo will offer users the chance to allocate a portion of advertising revenue generated by their mEgos to a non-profit cause of their choice.  The company&#8217;s growth will come from viral marketing and promotion and distribution deals with social networks and other sites. </p>\n\n<p>Future plans include adding the following features: expanded widget support, enhanced visuals, non-avatar profile for professional networking, browser sidebar profile and a mobile mEgo. </p>\n\n<p>Similar competitors in the online profile space include
