Base technology solutions on real-world business needs.</p>\n\n<p>Crown built their own business being the Guinea Pig of new technologies &#8211; so their customers wouldnâ€™t have to be. Today, their customers still count on them for cutting edge technologies that wonâ€™t bleed them dry.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the services that Crown provides include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Network Support for Small Business</li>\n<li>Virus Control and Network Security</li>\n<li>Spam Control</li>\n<li>Local and Wide Area Networks</li>\n<li>E-mail Solutions</li>\n<li>Remote access to your PC</li>\n<li>Document Management</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By taking time to learn your business, they can work together to build the best combination of hardware and software available to deliver a complete, turn-key solution. Then theyâ€™ll train and support your staff until they feel like experts themselves. While some businesses come and go, you can count on Crown to be there. After 10 years, theyâ€™re here to stay.</p>\n\n<p>â€œNo more IT Headachesâ€. They can affordably take care of these for you.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/6636/76636v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,117],"assets/images/resized/0007/6636/76636v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,211],"assets/images/resized/0007/6636/76636v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0007/6635/76635v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0007/6635/76635v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,368],"assets/images/resized/0007/6635/76635v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
