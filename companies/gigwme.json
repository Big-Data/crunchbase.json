The reason implies in the communication model used: &#8220;Publish and Broadcast&#8221; an asynchronous model that does not take into account the time sensitivity of the information shared.  But a lot of the information that flows on social networks is &#8220;time sensitive&#8221;  therefore this model fails.</p>\n\n<p>As results at GigWme we are working on a new platform that provides coordination and synchronization to  the information shared on the social network graphs. </p>\n\n<p>Initial focus has been on coordinating and optimizing the consumer free time.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0011/7062/117062v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0011/7062/117062v2-max-250x250.png"],[[313,113],"assets/images/resized/0011/7062/117062v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94109","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
