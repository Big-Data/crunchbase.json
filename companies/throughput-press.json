Back in the &#8220;print only&#8221; days of publishing. No one else got excited about this niche market, so Jeff &#8216;SKI&#8217; Kinsey first created a publishing entity to make the magazine happen: Throughput Press (TpP).</p>\n\n<p>It took just 95 days and less than $25K to create the full-color 64 page magazine using Goldratt&#8217;s TOC. TpP entered the book publishing arena in 2004 with the release of &#8220;Purple Curve Effect&#8221; by Jeff &#8216;SKI&#8217; Kinsey with Thayer Bennett. Three other manuscripts have been published.</p>\n\n<p>With Apple&#8217;s embedding of Newsstand in iOS5, TpP has now begun ePublishing magazines for the Apple iTunes Store. The first magazine is expected by the end of 3rdQtr2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0019/7714/197714v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,199],"assets/images/resized/0019/7714/197714v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,199],"assets/images/resized/0019/7714/197714v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Publisher & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jeff SKI","last_name":"Kinsey","permalink":"jeff-kinsey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-150x150.png"],[[210,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-250x250.png"],[[262,311],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Jeff &#8216;SKI&#8217; Kinsey / <a href=\"http://mainststark.com\" title=\"Main Street Stark\" rel=\"nofollow\">Main Street Stark</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nK5O5pTsbmo?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> ","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
