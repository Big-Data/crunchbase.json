Pipl&#8217;s query-engine is designed to retrieve information from the deep web.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web\" title=\"Deep web\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deep web</a> refers to underlying web content  such as dynamic pages stored in online databases. General purpose search engines cannot reach and index deep web.  Piplâ€™s robots are set to interact with searchable databases and extract facts, contact details and other relevant information from personal profiles, member directories, scientific publications, court records and numerous other deep-web sources. Pipl also aims to find relevant bits of information about a person by using advanced language-analysis and ranking algorithms.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/7195/17195v9-max-150x150.png"],[[125,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/7195/17195v9-max-250x250.png"],[[125,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/7195/17195v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Pipl","permalink":"pipl","image":{"available_sizes":[[[81,51],"assets/images/resized/0015/4610/154610v2-max-150x150.png"],[[81,51],"assets/images/resized/0015/4610/154610v2-max-250x250.png"],[[81,51],"assets/images/resized/0015/4610/154610v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"588 Sutter St.","address2":"#140","zip_code":"94102","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.081697,"longitude":-74.212014}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0019/8105/198105v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0019/8105/198105v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0019/8105/198105v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
