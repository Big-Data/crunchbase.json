The two first met while working at the video search technology company Truveo and built a popular search platform that served as the engine behind some of the most popular video destinations on the web.  During their time at Truveo, Tim and Mo witnessed how advances in distributed computing could enable complex analysis of media streams, including audio and video which wasn’t possible to analyze before.  They saw the potential for a new technology to extract meaning from continuous streams of information and enable new types of intelligent behavior in applications. </p>\n\n<p>With the support of some of Silicon Valley’s best-known investors and several prominent angel investors, Tim and Mo founded Expect Labs to leverage the capabilities of this platform to make real-time conversations easier and more productive. Their team includes George Kola and Brett Barros, along with other PhD&#8217;s and world-class researchers from places like the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Carnegie Mellon University, Bell Labs and HP Labs.</p>\n\n<p>For the past two years, Expect Labs has been developing a technology platform to serve as the foundation for new types of intelligent applications, which they call their “Anticipatory Computing Engine.” In the future, Expect Labs hopes this new technology platform can serve as a useful foundation upon which to build a wide range of intelligent applications focused on real-time conversations. </p>\n\n<p>As an initial use for this technology platform, they are creating an iPad app called MindMeld that aims to improve the way we have conversations by understanding what you say in real-time, making it easy to find and share related information as we talk.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, Expect Labs hopes their technology will be able to enhance conversations in other ways such as archiving and collaboration. The company’s ultimate goal is to build a general-purpose assistant that can facilitate the wide range of common tasks we often perform during conversations. With this purpose in mind, Expect Labs plans to open this platform to the developer community in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit Expect Labs at
