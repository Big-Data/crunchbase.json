It only takes a few clicks for software developers and website publishers to incorporate, hire and share revenue with other project members.</p>\n\n<p>FairSoftware is powered by the â€œSoftware Bill Of Rightsâ€, a legally sound contract in which virtual &#8220;shares&#8221; represent decision-making and revenue-sharing rights. This new virtual share concept makes it easy to give shares to anyone who helps out in some way, large or small. People are hired with shares instead of cash, growing a team that is committed to the project&#8217;s success. It costs nothing to incorporate or issue shares.</p>\n\n<p>Bloggers, designers and developers can use FairSoftware to grow their business by working together online, without having to deal with the complexity and limitations of traditional corporations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/4160/24160v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/4160/24160v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/4160/24160v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alain","last_name":"Raynaud","permalink":"alain-raynaud","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/4148/24148v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/4148/24148v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0002/4148/24148v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>RaphaÃ«l LabbÃ© /<a href=\"http://www.ulike.net/\" title=\"ulike.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">ulike.net</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Cambrian House","permalink":"cambrianhouse","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/2380/2380v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/2380/2380v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,216],"assets/images/resized/0000/2380/2380v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Elance","permalink":"elance","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cooley Godward Kronish","permalink":"cooley-godward","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$100k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94041","city":"Mountain View","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.386773,"longitude":-122.075222}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/hRbN8AUA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>From <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/\" title=\"Beet.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.tv</a></p>"},{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/9izNx2WG4R0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"352\" height=\"318\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed> ","description":"<p>TC50</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/5664/25664v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,130],"assets/images/resized/0002/5664/25664v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,235],"assets/images/resized/0002/5664/25664v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10035989-2.html","title":"CNET: FairSoftware virtualizes startups"},{"external_url":"http://www.geekbrief.tv/gbtv-433-geekbrieftv","title":"GeekBrief.TV: love the idea"}]}
