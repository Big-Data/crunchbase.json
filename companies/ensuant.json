A well understood effect of the Web 2.0 driven digitization, the amount of data available in enterprises has seen an order of magnitude increase in the last two decades. The companies that have utilized the deluge of data to improve key business processes such as customer satisfaction, product development, marketing, supply chain, and human resources have outperformed the rest. </p>\n\n<p>In the information driven age where the consumers have unlimited sets of tools, services and applications on the Internet, enterprises have found it difficult to innovate due to a multitude of factors. These include rigid software design, poor software quality, lengthy implementation times and high costs that are inherent in the old three tier architectures. Ensuant uses a model driven approach targeted at business users and IT alike to collaborate on the transformation of raw data to &#8220;information&#8221;. Unlike collaboration on the consumer Internet which is a peer to peer model, the collaboration and information flow in an enterprise has inherent role based demands. Thus, the &#8220;One Size Fits All&#8221; strategy of the consumer world does not fit for the end users in an enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>Guiding Principles</p>\n\n<p>Given the changing face of business, all applications delivered by Ensuant meet the following goals in order to reduce deployment times and overall solution costs:\nWeb based provisioning, delivery and management.\nPrivate and Public Cloud &#8220;Ready&#8221;.\nNative collaboration.\nHorizontal and vertical scaling on commodity hardware.\nSemantic Model Driven, Zero to Minimal Coding.\nBuilt-in Analytics.\nReuse existing investments in BPM, SOA, EDA and CEP.</p>\n\n<p>We are excited about the No-SQL movement, though we believe the issues No-SQL is trying to solve are not related to the revered structure of relational databases but their usage. In any case, everything is on the table and why? The definition of insanity is to keep doing things the same way and expect a different result.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying sentiment in the business community is that the evolution of technology within the enterprise hasnâ€™t kept up with the brand new world of globalized, networked, highly competitive market places experiencing exponential increases in digital information needing to be harnessed. Thereâ€™s a fair bit of truth in that sentiment, and we believe that the current set of tools, products and methodology in enterprise software are not designed and built for this new reality where information is democratic, albeit governed, and a network of micro applications taking days to develop (not years!) and a network of globally distributed developers who need to collaborate. It is not unfathomable to imagine a world of an â€œenterprise software marketplaceâ€ with pint sized footprints you can take for a test drive, and buy or lease into your network, and somehow they just work together, voila. It is also not too farfetched to imagine easy to use, business user driven applications to coalesce the data generated by these applications into a fabric of real time and historical models without worrying about ETL, Data Warehouses and OLAP.</p>\n\n<p>This is the brave new world of cloud and why not? The cloud is the inflection point in the history of software and our team is totally committed and excited about the potential impact on everything related to this discipline. Goodbye to clunky hard coded schemas, hard coded business logic, hard coded reports, slow, visually unappealing user interfaces, months to add a couple of fields to a table et al. You get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>If you are someone who gets excited at the idea of working with a smart, dynamic team, obsessed with the idea of creating a platform for business, and still believe that â€˜writing optimized code is the only way to programâ€™, do send an email about what you want to do to jobs@ensuantinc.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0009/2186/92186v7-max-150x150.png"],[[193,56],"assets/images/resized/0009/2186/92186v7-max-250x250.png"],[[193,56],"assets/images/resized/0009/2186/92186v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Puneet","last_name":"Arora","permalink":"puneet-arora","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder/COO ","person":{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"Jeffers","permalink":"susan-jeffers","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Sunil","last_name":"Mehta","permalink":"sunil-mehta","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1059/51059v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,225],"assets/images/resized/0005/1059/51059v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,225],"assets/images/resized/0005/1059/51059v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Sunil","last_name":"Mehta","permalink":"sunil-mehta","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1059/51059v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,225],"assets/images/resized/0005/1059/51059v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,225],"assets/images/resized/0005/1059/51059v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main","address1":"1895 Landings Dr","address2":"","zip_code":"94043","city":"Mountain View","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Ensuant gains MGM Grand Resorts International as a customer ","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":26,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Ensuant","permalink":"ensuant"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
