Users can contribute to content and help build up a business&#8217;s brand by adding new items, creating lists, and correcting data. The WebKite platform comes equipped with community tools like built-in wikis, item ratings and reviews, social logins, and site feeds. </p>\n\n<p>WebKite enables website growth through inherent SEO. For instance, a WebKite site with 1,000 items and 10 user-saved lists creates over half a million unique page that can rise to the top of search.</p>\n\n<p>Webkite is a fully functioning website that can be themed to match your existing site or can stand on its own. Regardless of implementation, WebKite will reflect your brand.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0020/8019/208019v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0020/8019/208019v2-max-250x250.png"],[[251,189],"assets/images/resized/0020/8019/208019v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Silver","permalink":"eric-silver-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Meulbroek","permalink":"peter-meulbroek","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"WebKite Office","address1":"Suite 440","address2":"700 River Avenue","zip_code":"15212","city":"Pittsburgh","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Added Peter Meulbroek as CTO.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":9,"source_url":"http://www.sharewellnewswire.com/new-cto-at-webkite-2339.htm/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Sharewell Newswire","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"WebKite","permalink":"webkite"}},{"description":"WebKite launches","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":26,"source_url":"http://webkite.com/webkite-launches/","source_text":null,"source_description":"WebKite Launches - Press Release","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"WebKite","permalink":"webkite"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2012/07/30/anatomy-of-a-pivot-from-pikimal-to.html?ana=twt&page=all","title":"Anatomy of a pivot: From Pikimal to WebKite"},{"external_url":"http://betakit.com/2012/08/06/webkite-launches-data-comparison-content-management-platform?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pulsenews","title":"WebKite Turns Data Into Websites with New Content Management System"},{"external_url":"http://www.newpa.com/newsroom/governor-corbett-lead-mission-silicon-valley-attract-new-investment-and-jobs","title":"Governor Corbett to Lead Mission to Silicon Valley to Attract New Investment and Jobs"},{"external_url":"http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/corbett-sells-silicon-valley-on-states-offerings-649160/","title":"Corbett sells Silicon Valley on state's offerings"}]}
