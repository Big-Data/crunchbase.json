These can be distributed across the Pinnion apps for iPhone and Android, the Pinnion plugin for WordPress, and embed codes that allow questionnaires to be placed in any webpage. Users can distribute a Pinnion to any or all of these outlets at simultaneously, then view responses from all outlets in a single, real-time reporting tool. </p>\n\n<p>Pinnion is designed to be ideal for any topic or industry and we&#8217;ve seen a particular interest in its audience response capabilities. Broadcasters such as KCTS-TV and KNHC-FM are using Pinnion, along with WordPress bloggers and developers.\nUsers can segment their audience using Channels, while audience members also have the power to join or leave Channels at any time based on their individual interests. Pinnions are distributed to each audience member&#8217;s Channel Page, then automatically disappear once the Pinnion is completed or expired, whichever comes first.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[46,46],"assets/images/resized/0016/9948/169948v2-max-150x150.png"],[[46,46],"assets/images/resized/0016/9948/169948v2-max-250x250.png"],[[46,46],"assets/images/resized/0016/9948/169948v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Gause","permalink":"gary-gause","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Leath","permalink":"bill-leath","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"SurveyMonkey","permalink":"surveymonkey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0004/1973/41973v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0004/1973/41973v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0004/1973/41973v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"SurveyGizmo","permalink":"surveygizmo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/9950/19950v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/9950/19950v2-max-250x250.png"],[[310,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/9950/19950v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Quibblo","permalink":"quibblo","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Zoomerang","permalink":"zoomerang","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/4931/54931v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/4931/54931v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[311,75],"assets/images/resized/0005/4931/54931v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"PollDaddy","permalink":"polldaddy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/2914/2914v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/2914/2914v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/2914/2914v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"2319 N 45th St","address2":"#205","zip_code":"98103","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9945/169945v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/9945/169945v2-max-250x250.png"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/9945/169945v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9946/169946v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/9946/169946v2-max-250x250.png"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/9946/169946v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9947/169947v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/9947/169947v2-max-250x250.png"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/9947/169947v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pinnion/","title":"Pinnion Wordpress Plugin"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pinnion/225895277438863","title":"Facebook Page"},{"external_url":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinnion/id429091480?mt=8","title":"iTunes Pinnion App Download"},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_communication","title":"About Structured Communication"},{"external_url":"http://www.pinnion.com/events/","title":"Event Polling"},{"external_url":"http://www.pinnion.com/survey/","title":"Guide to Creating Surveys (eBook)"},{"external_url":"http://www.pinnion.com/wordpress/","title":"Wordpress Survey Plugin"},{"external_url":"http://www.pinnion.com/audience-response/","title":"Audience Response"},{"external_url":"http://startuptunes.com/2012/05/03/pinnion-say-goodbye-to-boring-surveys/","title":""}]}
