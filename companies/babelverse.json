Skilled multilingual speakers and professional interpreters alike will be able to earn money for interpreting remotely.</p>\n\n<p>We are now available to events and conferences, for both attendees and remote viewers, making any live-streamed video available in multiple languages, for people who would be unable to attend, let alone understand. We ran a proof of concept for this with the State of the Union speech by President Obama in January.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, Babelverse will be open to the public in any situation where they may need it to communicate, like when travelling abroad, business meetings, phone calls, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Our vision is a universe where everyone communicates seamlessly, while speaking their native language. We aim to do to language barriers what the aeroplane did to geographical barriers.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://babelverse.com/\" title=\"babelverse.com\"
