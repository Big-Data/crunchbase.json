Even fewer can say that from those 100 emails came 10 million unique visitors a day.  Such is the story of the creation of Piczo.com, a social networking site aimed at young teens.  Piczo presents itself as the safer alternative to other social networking sites like <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com\" title=\"Myspace\" rel=\"nofollow\">Myspace</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.friendster.com\" title=\"Friendster\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friendster</a>.  This emphasis on safety is due to heavy involvement by <a href=\"http://www.wiredsafety.org\" title=\"WiredSafety\" rel=\"nofollow\">WiredSafety</a> and the Child Exploiation and Online Protection Agency.  In 2007, Piczo announced <a href=\"http://pic3.piczo.com/public/corporate/piczoFunding.html\" title=\"$11 Million in Series C funding\" rel=\"nofollow\">$11 Million in Series C funding</a>, primarily by U.S. Venture Partners and Mangrove Capital. In September 2009 Piczo changed is design to a more girlish design thinking that it would increase it&#8217;s users, but it only made things worse, both sex&#8217;s rebelled against this change and still to this day Piczo hasn&#8217;t regretted changing although many of it&#8217;s users are now switching to alternatives such as <a href=\"http://www.weebly.com\" title=\"Weebly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weebly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.webs.com\" title=\"Webs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Updated on 1st September 2010 by <a href=\"http://pic2.piczo.com/go/user/mongrels\"
