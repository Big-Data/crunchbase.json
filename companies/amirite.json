Both a website and iPhone application, which recently emerged from beta, amirite invites users to post an opinion about absolutely anything. Discussions range from the serious and political to the funny and bizarre. Amirite.net is new and innovative and something unique, which many new sites of this nature lack. It differs from Facebook and Twitter type sites in the sense that opinions are voiced straight to the world while at the same time people can build strong tight -knit communities and form long-term friendships with a variety of people. Amirite will also overtime be ‘the’ platform for market research. The site’s recent integration with social networks will enable its userbase to grow rapidly.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0021/8222/218222v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0021/8222/218222v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0021/8222/218222v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Operations Manager","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Hampton","permalink":"james-hampton","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0021/8220/218220v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0021/8220/218220v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0021/8220/218220v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0021/8221/218221v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0021/8221/218221v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0021/8221/218221v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/30/amirite-net-exciting-new-startup-set-to-go-viral/","title":"Exciting New Startup Set to go viral"},{"external_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/amirite-net-launches-beta-stage-130100288.html","title":"Amirite.net Launches out of Beta Stage"}]}
