When users start typing search keywords into the query box, the search engine speedily starts returning relevant results based on the letters they have already started typing. Vtap can do this because their search technology indexes letters and characters instead of whole words like other search engines. This allows users to type in abbreviated search keywords instead of typing a whole word, which makes more sense for mobile users.</p>\n\n<p>They plan on launching the service in September 2007.
