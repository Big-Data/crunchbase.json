Currently searching within 30M+ reviews, while working hard to transform them from regular reviews to social reviews.  Simply put, a social review is a review that is related to the searcherâ€™s social graph. To achieve this goal, Yotpo allows users to claim past reviews and also write new social reviews. \nFor the first time, Yotpoâ€™s unique ranking algorithm takes into consideration social relation of the author and the searcher, the author past social reactions, the review past social reactions and a lot more. \nBy that, Yotpo gives the searcher a new personalized search experience that produces more quality, credible and social results than any other reviews search engine today. \nIn other words, Yotpo is revolutionizing the way users consume reviews. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0012/9111/129111v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0012/9111/129111v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,444],"assets/images/resized/0012/9111/129111v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Tomer","last_name":"Tagrin","permalink":"tomer-tagrin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0013/1125/131125v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0013/1125/131125v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0013/1125/131125v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Omri","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"omri-cohen-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/0413/160413v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[226,226],"assets/images/resized/0016/0413/160413v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[226,226],"assets/images/resized/0016/0413/160413v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Omri Cohen</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"UI Ninja","person":{"first_name":"Itai","last_name":"Nathaniel","permalink":"itai-nathaniel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/5378/185378v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/5378/185378v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0018/5378/185378v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"R&D Ninja","person":{"first_name":"Avichay","last_name":"Etzioni","permalink":"avichay-etzioni","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"R&D Ninja","person":{"first_name":"Vlad","last_name":"Shub","permalink":"vlad-shub","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"R&D Ninja","person":{"first_name":"Gil","last_name":"Silas","permalink":"gil-silas","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"R&D Ninja","person":{"first_name":"Ran","last_name":"Weizman","permalink":"ran-weizman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/18/yotpo-raises-800k-for-its-opinion-aggregation-engine/","source_description":"Yotpo Raises $800K For Its Opinion Aggregation Engine","raised_amount":800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"2B Angels","permalink":"2b-angels","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"PLUS Ventures","permalink":"plus-ventures","image":null},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/30/yotpo-closes-1-5m-round-led-by-rhodium-and-gandyr-group-to-scale-social-reviews/","source_description":"Yotpo Closes $1.5M Round Led by Rhodium And Gandyr Group To Scale Social Reviews","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":31,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Rhodium","permalink":"rhodium","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/7963/77963v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[236,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/7963/77963v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[236,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/7963/77963v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Zohar","last_name":"Gilon","permalink":"zohar-gilon","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Tron Capital","permalink":"tron-capital","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"PLUS Ventures","permalink":"plus-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"2B Angels","permalink":"2b-angels","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"14 Oscar Shindler","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Tel Aviv","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
