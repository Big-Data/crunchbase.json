(2) Social Identity Reports, which search, find and isolate employment oriented information related to job-seekers. (3) SocializedHR, an applicant tracking dashboard, which is an underlying database to manage job-seeker data.\nAs first products in the vision, they help organizations zero-in on existing job-seekers. Veechiâ€™s products have been lauded by the HR community, with positive reviews coming from such heavy hitters as Futurestep, Bersin &amp; Associates, and Bill Kutik. In May, 2011, an alliance with Taleo Corp was made public. Our products are now pre-integrated with Taleo Business Edition, the market-leading applicant tracking system (ATS).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[94,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/3293/73293v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[94,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/3293/73293v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[94,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/3293/73293v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Sovren","permalink":"sovren","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0017/3315/173315v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0017/3315/173315v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0017/3315/173315v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
