It serves the purpose of supplying it&#8217;s users with a free link and QR code that will take others to the user&#8217;s complete online presence in one click or one scan of their &#8220;Social Identity QR Code&#8221; with their smartphone.  We don&#8217;t use clunky API feeds that we can&#8217;t control, and we aren&#8217;t trying to recreate those site&#8217;s on your ItsMyURLs profile.  Just sign up, add your links, add a pic, and a little about yourself and you are ready to pass your ItsMyURLs link to anyone, via email signature, business card, promo materials, letterhead, etc.  See why the biggest pop culture icons as well as athletes, icons and other celebrities are using ItsMyURLs rather than other services!   </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder & CFO","person":{"first_name":"Harout","last_name":"\"Junior\" Khandjian","permalink":"harout-junior-khandjian","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eddy","last_name":"Inserra","permalink":"eddy-inserra","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Phil","last_name":"Kokoska","permalink":"phil-kokoska","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder & CMO","person":{"first_name":"Mukhtar","last_name":"Mohamed","permalink":"mukhtar-mohamed","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Central Office","address1":"198 Tremont St, Suite 110","address2":"","zip_code":"02116","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/25472607?badge=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/25472607\">What is ItsMyURLs?</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user7419566\">ItsMyURLs</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>ItsMyURLs Demo</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B619n2aW6MSvNmM5NzE4NDgtZWUwYi00MmI2LTgxZjQtMDJhNDU1ZTM0MGI5&hl=en_US","title":"Boston Herald (Full Page, Sunday Edition)"},{"external_url":"http://www.examiner.com/geek-culture-in-rapid-city/itsmyurls-is-my-new-favorite-social-tool-for-all-one-place-easy-information?sms_ss=twitter&at_xt=4cf4437c560f05dd,0","title":"Examiner Story"},{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/itsmyurl_puts_your_whole_online_id_into_a_barcode.php","title":"ReadWriteWeb Article"},{"external_url":"http://bostinnovation.com/2011/01/06/create-a-one-stop-shop-for-your-personal-brand-with-itsmyurls-com/","title":"BostInnovation Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76GNU-i1oak","title":"Hollywood Red Carpet Interview"}]}
