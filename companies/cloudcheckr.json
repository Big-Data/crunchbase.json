It picks up where the AWS management console and reports leave off. CloudCheckr uses read-only credentials to compile a complete inventory of a userâ€™s deployment. Cloudcheckr then analyzes and reports on that environment. It distills the information into usable actionable intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>First, Cloudcheckr serves as a cost analysis solution. From a pure cost perspective, Cloudcheckr analyzes usage from both a &#8220;right-sizing&#8221; and a &#8220;right-purchasing&#8221; perspective. It benchmarks usage against peer groups, makes recommendations, and quantifies the costs associated with present choices. CloudCheckr provides insight into the savings possible from alternate choices.</p>\n\n<p>Second, CloudCheckr serves as a managerial information tool. It offers a granular look into an AWS deployment. CloudCheckr identifies resources by type, region, usage, and more. It provides a graphical map of resources. CloudCheckr performs a comprehensive analysis of S3 files. CloudCheckr also provides a change monitoring function. </p>\n\n<p>Third, CloudCheckr also assists in security and compliance. Beyond change monitoring, CloudCheckr compares a deployment against a proprietary list of best security and compliance practices. It notifies the user and prioritizes variances.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
