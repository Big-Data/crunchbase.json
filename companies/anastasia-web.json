Anastasia is a proud member of the American Society of Travel Agents and the Central &amp; Eastern Europe Travel Board, and our Romance Tours have long been recognized as the benchmark by which other tour companies are measured. Our reputation for honesty and integrity has been the key to our success, which is why half of our clients come to us by word of mouth alone.</p>\n\n<p>Anastasiaâ€™s tour receptions are famous and are attended eagerly by some of the most beautiful women in Russia and Ukraine. Only Anastasia International has the resources and experience to bring groups to Russia and Ukraine on a frequent and regular basis. Our 146th tour departed Feb. 10, 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Anastasia is the only Romance tour company to be founded, owned and operated by a Russian/American couple; giving us a degree of insight and expertise that cannot be matched by our competitors. Our owners, David and Elena Besuden met in 1992 through an introduction service and were married that same year.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/0430/20430v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/0430/20430v1-max-250x250.png"],[[262,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/0430/20430v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"40 High St","address2":"Suite #1","zip_code":"04401","city":"Bangor","state_code":"ME","country_code":"USA","latitude":44.800708,"longitude":-68.7741072}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/9439/49439v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/9439/49439v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0004/9439/49439v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://onlinepersonalswatch.typepad.com/news/2006/09/opw_interview_a.html","title":"General Director Alexei Negin Interview  09/06"}]}
