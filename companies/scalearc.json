The ScaleArc iDB software abstracts database servers from application servers to provide instant horizontal scaling and connection management, and enablesreal-time visibility into every query to provide real-time analytics and instant troubleshooting, one-click query caching, wire-speed security enforcement, and much more. Until now, achieving such capabilities required significant investment in engineering resources and ongoing maintenance with too many single-purpose solutions from multiple sources that require constant changes to applications, as well as individual management and upkeep.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0016/7083/167083v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,63],"assets/images/resized/0016/7083/167083v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[244,63],"assets/images/resized/0016/7083/167083v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5.33M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/2011/12/20/scalearc-raises-533-million-to-fund-expansion/11867932","source_description":"ScaleArc Raises $5.33 Million to Fund Expansion","raised_amount":5330000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":20,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Trinity Ventures","permalink":"trinity-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/9369/19369v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/9369/19369v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/9369/19369v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Nexus Venture Partners","permalink":"nexus-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/9397/29397v6-max-150x150.png"],[[159,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9397/29397v6-max-250x250.png"],[[159,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9397/29397v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2200 Sand Hill Road, Suite 100","address2":"","zip_code":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0016/7084/167084v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,196],"assets/images/resized/0016/7084/167084v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,354],"assets/images/resized/0016/7084/167084v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
