SwingTIP helps golfers improve their swing by sending real-time visual and performance data to an iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or Android™ device and MySwingTIP.com. </p>\n\n<p>Mobiplex has developed a proprietary ProView™ Motion Analysis™ engine that can accurately capture, analyze and digitally reproduce a sports motion in three dimensions. The company will employ this IP to develop wireless and mobile sports performance technology for all types of Bluetooth app-cessories for various sports - beyond golf.</p>\n\n<p>The Mobiplex founders have a combined 10 patents in biomechanics, wireless technology, motion sensing, technology and pattern recognition. </p>\n\n<p>The Mobiplex management team has a strong track record of building numerous startup companies and business units from inception to major industry successes. The team is well represented in all areas – wireless and mobile technology, manufacturing, sales and marketing, operations and golf.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0021/6905/216905v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0021/6905/216905v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,106],"assets/images/resized/0021/6905/216905v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SwingTIP Wireless 3D Golf Swing Analyzer","permalink":"swingtip-wireless-3d-golf-swing-analyzer","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vijay","last_name":"Nadkarni","permalink":"vijay-nadkarni","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, VP Research & Development","person":{"first_name":"Umang","last_name":"Salgia","permalink":"umang-salgia","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb10070213.htm","source_description":"Press Release","raised_amount":3100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":30,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Private","last_name":"investors","permalink":"private-investors-2","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"2700 Augustine Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"95054","city":"Santa Clara","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/q6aPUOWlV0E?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>SwingTIP Craig Stadler Product Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6902/216902v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/6902/216902v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/6902/216902v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6903/216903v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/6903/216903v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/6903/216903v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0021/6904/216904v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0021/6904/216904v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,240],"assets/images/resized/0021/6904/216904v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0021/7529/217529v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,124],"assets/images/resized/0021/7529/217529v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,224],"assets/images/resized/0021/7529/217529v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0021/7530/217530v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0021/7530/217530v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,223],"assets/images/resized/0021/7530/217530v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.golf.com/instruction/swingtip-golf-app","title":"Sports Illustrated Golf.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-equipment/blogs/newstuff/2012/09/-by-john-strege-the.html#ixzz27b6llXAT","title":"Golf Digest"},{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2012/10/17/improve-golf-swing-device/","title":"Mashable"},{"external_url":"http://www.7x7.com/tech-gadgets/new-high-tech-way-help-golfers-improve-their-swings","title":"7X7 Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://www.golfcentralmagazine.com/arizona.html","title":"Arizona Golf Central Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://pandodaily.com/2012/10/30/fore-mobiplex-raises-3-1m-to-tackle-sports-performance-hardware-starting-with-golf/","title":"PandoDaily"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/Q46yfd","title":"Dow Jones VentureWire"},{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/30/funding-daily-a-cocktail-in-the-morning/","title":"Venture Beat"},{"external_url":"http://vator.tv/news/2012-10-30-mobiplex-scores-31m-for-mobile-sports-analyzers","title":"VatorTV News"}]}
