RPR allows broadcasters to achieve massively higher reach and significantly lower broadcast costs over traditional streaming and CDN technologies.  RPR enables the delivery of a live TV signal, of up to HD quality, to millions of TV viewers around the globe using a single TVUBroadcast appliance and a single ADSL connection. With RPR, all the viewers watching a channel cooperate and contribute bandwidth to give everyone the best possible signal and viewing experience.  The bandwidth required to broadcast therefore does not increase with the number of viewers and higher viewership actually enhances the viewing quality. </p>\n\n<p>With TVU, broadcasters are offered a full suite of monetization tools, including subscription channels, pay-per-view events, and personalized in-stream ad insertion tools.  Content rights management tools and geo-filtering capabilities allow broadcasters to limit their coverage to specific regions, allowing them for example to honor existing cable distribution contracts while expanding their reach.  </p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s TVUAds personalized advertising engine enables seamless in-stream advertising that is targeted to viewers based on their demographics and geographies.  TVUAds enables the ingest of existing cue tones to empower broadcasters to effectively re-monetize their existing linear channels on the Internet, without needing to recondition the signal.  </p>","image":null,"products":[{"name":"TVUPlayer","permalink":"tvuplayer","image":null},{"name":"TVUBroadcast","permalink":"tvubroadcast","image":null},{"name":"TVUScheduler","permalink":"tvuscheduler","image":null},{"name":"TVUAds","permalink":"tvuads","image":null},{"name":"BD1000 Broadcast Appliance","permalink":"bd1000-broadcast-appliance","image":null},{"name":"TVUPack","permalink":"tvupack","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Shen","permalink":"paul-shen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO and VP Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Shen","permalink":"jay-shen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Media Sales","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Robertson","permalink":"dave-robertson-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"EVP, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Kap","last_name":"Shin","permalink":"kap-shin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Management","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Lofgren","permalink":"dan-lofgren","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Thanasis","last_name":"Delistathis","permalink":"thanasis-delistathis","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Marketing & Partner Relations","person":{"first_name":"Mika","last_name":"Saitoh","permalink":"mika-saitoh","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Justin.TV","permalink":"justintv","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7031/27031v20-max-150x150.png"],[[148,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7031/27031v20-max-250x250.png"],[[148,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7031/27031v20-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Livestream","permalink":"livestream","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/0322/322v10-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/0322/322v10-max-250x250.png"],[[300,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/0322/322v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"LiveU","permalink":"liveu","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0001/9831/19831v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[154,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/9831/19831v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[154,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/9831/19831v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati","permalink":"wilson-sonsini-goodrich-rosati","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0001/9486/19486v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/9486/19486v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/9486/19486v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1685 Plymouth St.","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"94043","city":"Mountain View","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.416349,"longitude":-122.085021},{"description":"TVU Networks (China)","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Shanghai","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"New York Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
