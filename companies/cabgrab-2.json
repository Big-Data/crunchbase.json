The application is available free from the App Store, Android Market, Facebook and cabgrab.net .</p>\n\n<p>CabGrab® seeks to transform and simplify the taxi booking process for the benefit of passengers, taxi operators and the wider community. For the passenger, online booking is faster, easier and convenient since there is no finding and waiting at ranks or flagging down taxis needed. It’s more reliable because CabGrab® takes care of the pick-up location through geolocation, so there is no risk of misunderstanding where you are - especially if you are in an unfamiliar part of the town. Electronic booking even improves safety and assists in recovering lost items. Taxi operators benefit by attracting new, valuable, tech-savvy passengers, and they reduce costs and streamline operations through automation. In short, CabGrab Limited offers a Win-Win for those connected to the taxi community.</p>\n\n<p>CabGrab® is committed to improving the taxi experience for all through innovation, quality and service. We aim to be the only taxi application you would need no matter where you are located.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/7015/217015v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/7015/217015v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/7015/217015v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marvin","last_name":"Plummeridge","permalink":"marvin-plummeridge","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Burke","permalink":"greg-burke","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"SK15 2RP","city":"Stalybridge","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lDb_v43FnSI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>CabGrab® for iPhone, iPad and Android</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/5640/215640v2-max-150x150.png"],[[153,230],"assets/images/resized/0021/5640/215640v2-max-250x250.png"],[[153,230],"assets/images/resized/0021/5640/215640v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/5641/215641v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/5641/215641v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/5641/215641v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/5642/215642v2-max-150x150.png"],[[216,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/5642/215642v2-max-250x250.png"],[[385,445],"assets/images/resized/0021/5642/215642v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.mynewsmag.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1140%3Abusiness-secretary-impressed-by-young-marvin-from-bushey&Itemid=1","title":"Business Secretary impressed with CabGrab®"}]}
