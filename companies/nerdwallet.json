Many cardholders  are left looking for new cards, but the online credit card search world is littered with affiliate sites, whose selection is limited to cards that pay the sites kickbacks, so a user is only ever offered incomplete or misleading information. </p>\n\n<p>But with hundreds of banks and thousands of credit unions issuing cards in the US alone, how can a consumer expect to find the perfect card when given only 50 or so choices?</p>\n\n<p>This is why NerdWallet.com offers more than 1,600 cards and a dead-simple interface, so that consumers have an easy way to find the right card for their needs.  NerdWallet provides unbiased analyses of rewards programs and objectively ranks a userâ€™s best credit card options, regardless of whether the cards pay referral fees.  </p>\n\n<p>In a user&#8217;s search results, cards are ranked based on financial merit to the user, rather than financial merit to the website owner. Out of the 1,600+ cards in the companyâ€™s database, less than 10% are sponsored, explaining why NerdWallet has so many more search results.</p>\n\n<p>As a demonstration of the content&#8217;s depth, here are hypothetical search results for a user with excellent credit (current as of 3/2010):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rewards</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>38 card listings beat a 1% no-fee rewards card</li>\n<li>7 card listings offer a flat 2% rewards rate for all purchases</li>\n<li>8 card listings average above 2% due to generous bonus categories</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Low Interest Rates</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>50 card listings offer a minimum APR of less than 10%</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With this depth, and with more content being added every day, NerdWallet seeks to become the number one online source for unbiased credit card information.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/1543/81543v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/1543/81543v2-max-250x250.png"],[[274,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/1543/81543v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"tim-chen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Gibson","permalink":"jacob-gibson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Personal Financial Management","person":{"first_name":"Shiyan","last_name":"Koh","permalink":"shiyan-koh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2477/202477v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0020/2477/202477v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0020/2477/202477v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Anisha","last_name":"Sekar","permalink":"anisha-sekar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Personal Financial Management Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"Granger","permalink":"amelia-granger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2196/202196v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2196/202196v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[268,270],"assets/images/resized/0020/2196/202196v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Financial Markets","person":{"first_name":"Joanna","last_name":"Pratt","permalink":"joanna-pratt","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Intern","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Mai","permalink":"andy-mai-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/3324/143324v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/3324/143324v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/3324/143324v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Mint.com","permalink":"mint","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-150x150.png"],[[194,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-250x250.png"],[[194,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"BillShrink","permalink":"billshrink","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/3770/13770v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0001/3770/13770v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0001/3770/13770v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"CreditCards.com","permalink":"creditcards-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/3175/43175v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/3175/43175v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/3175/43175v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"West Coast HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"We are proud to officially launch our credit union credit card search tool today.
