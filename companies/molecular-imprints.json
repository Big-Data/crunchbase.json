(MII) was founded in Austin, Texas in 2001, spun out of the University of Texas. Molecular Imprints has applied for over 700 patents, resulting in a growing portfolio of over 100 patents issued covering imprint tools, imprint materials and masks/templates, process technology and imprint-specific device designs. Jet and Flashâ„¢ Imprint Lithography (J-FILâ„¢), powered by their IntelliJetâ„¢ Drop Pattern Generator Drop Pattern Generation System, is the heart of Molecular Imprintsâ€™ advanced nanoimprint technology, allowing precise placement of photoresist on substrates in picoliter quantities, enabling uniform and consistent nanoimprinting of features down to 10nm and below at very low cost. Molecular Imprints delivers this value to customers through integration of a unique set of core competencies and partnerships that cover lithography, precision nanomechanics, fluid dynamics, surface chemistry and materials formulation.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0010/3822/103822v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/3822/103822v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[214,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/3822/103822v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$17M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.molecularimprints.com/pdf/archives/news_articles05/SeriesC-pr.pdf","source_description":"MOLECULAR IMPRINTS COMPLETES $17M FINANCING","raised_amount":17000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Alloy Ventures","permalink":"alloy-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/3916/3916v1-max-150x150.png"],[[113,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/3916/3916v1-max-250x250.png"],[[113,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/3916/3916v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":{"name":"Dai Nippon Printing","permalink":"dai-nippon-printing","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0009/6330/96330v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/6330/96330v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[345,48],"assets/images/resized/0009/6330/96330v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Motorola Ventures","permalink":"motorola-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/9259/29259v1-max-150x150.png"],[[130,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/9259/29259v1-max-250x250.png"],[[130,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/9259/29259v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Harris & Harris Group","permalink":"harris-harris-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/2214/32214v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/2214/32214v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/2214/32214v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ)","permalink":"draper-fisher-jurvetson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":{"name":"Hakuto Co.
