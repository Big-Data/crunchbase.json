DECA, however, will not serve as a destination for these properties, but rather invest in them and distribute them through their partner&#8217;s channels.</p>\n\n<p>There is little word on what properties they will focus their money on, but they will be announcing their first 3 projects in the fall of 2007. Web video shows are definitely in the cards, with non-video properties on the horizon as well.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/1066/1066v4-max-150x150.png"],[[85,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/1066/1066v4-max-250x250.png"],[[85,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/1066/1066v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Cool
