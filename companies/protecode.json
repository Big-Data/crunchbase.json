Protecode utilizes a comprehensive proprietary database of more than 450,000 indexed public open source projects as a reference to match against other software libraries to identify open source components and cross-reference corresponding license obligations.  The Protecode product suite produces a software inventory report cross-referenced to licensing and copyright attributes to indicate corresponding licensing obligations.  Installation is an overlay on existing design, development and testing environments and does not require changes to existing workflows.  Protecode can be customized for individual company divisions, product lines, or geographic offices including with project-level user group, role, permission and license policy administration. </p>\n\n<p>Protecode also offers an audit service where Protecode Professional Services can analyze software licensing in situations such as upcoming business transactions like M&amp;A.
