It will then scan new emails once a week to update the gallery.</p>\n\n<p>2pad&#8217;s gallery is a full-featured AJAX gallery allowing users to easily find, enjoy, share and print pictures. 2pad&#8217;s gallery is also iPhone enabled.</p>\n\n<p>2pad&#8217;s ability to process both photos and videos allows users to send one single link to a mixed slide show. Recipients viewing this slide show can rate and comment it.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4439/24439v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4439/24439v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/4439/24439v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CFO","person":{"first_name":"Philippe","last_name":"Lumbroso","permalink":"philippe-lumbroso","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4444/24444v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4444/24444v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/4444/24444v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Boublil","permalink":"aaron-boublil","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4442/24442v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4442/24442v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[325,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/4442/24442v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Ary","last_name":"Tebeka","permalink":"ary-tebeka","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4443/24443v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[192,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4443/24443v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[332,432],"assets/images/resized/0002/4443/24443v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Kalow","permalink":"mark-kalow","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Xoopit","permalink":"xoopit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/6605/16605v3-max-150x150.png"],[[171,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6605/16605v3-max-250x250.png"],[[171,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6605/16605v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Ravutsky 29","address2":"","zip_code":"43220","city":"Raanana","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/hRbOpRgA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>From <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/\" title=\"Beet.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.tv</a></p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/newsroom/2pad/","title":"2pad's newsroom"}]}
