It is a system that allows you to get the advice your family doctor would give you in a matter of minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Earlydoc&#8217;s mission is to offer personal and reliable medical information, to make it possible to manage your medical complaints yourself, to make medical advice accessible and relieve pressure on the healthcare system. </p>\n\n<p>Most people search online for information about their complaints or illnesses before they see a doctor. Most of the time the information they find is of little to no use. Earlydoc is different and offers personal advice to people at home with a medical complaint. You will get an answer to the questions you really have, like &#8216;Is it serious?&#8217;, &#8216;Should I see a doctor?&#8217;, &#8216;What can I do myself?&#8217;, &#8216;What do I have to watch out for?&#8217;. Earlydoc is completely based on guidelines and medical research and is reviewed by doctors. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1426/201426v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1426/201426v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1426/201426v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Marieke","last_name":"Schoutsen","permalink":"marieke-schoutsen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Travis","last_name":"Dunn","permalink":"travis-dunn","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Vidoze","permalink":"vidoze","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0014/6150/146150v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0014/6150/146150v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0014/6150/146150v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Amsterdam office","address1":"Kleine gartmanplantsoen 10","address2":"","zip_code":"1017RR","city":"Amsterdam","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0020/1424/201424v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0020/1424/201424v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,377],"assets/images/resized/0020/1424/201424v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0020/1425/201425v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,194],"assets/images/resized/0020/1425/201425v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,350],"assets/images/resized/0020/1425/201425v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
