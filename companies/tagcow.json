If thereâ€™s a mountain in the photo, itâ€™s tagged. A dog? yep. A yellow cup? Absolutely. It does people, too. Upload an image of a person and say who it is, and all other images you upload will be tagged with that person, too. The service also integrates with Flickr and will auto tag the photos you have on the service.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/6545/16545v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/6545/16545v2-max-250x250.png"],[[280,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/6545/16545v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Z.
