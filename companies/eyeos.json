Although the use of the term Operating System is questionable as it run over a browser window and have little interaction with the hardware, web desktops or &#8220;webtop&#8221; are growing in popularity.</p>\n\n<p>eyeOS was one of the first Open Source project to create a whole Web Operating System and does currently provide a default desktop with some base applications &#8211; some of which include: Word Processor, SpreadSheets, Calendar, Contacts, mp3 player, and an RSS feed reader. Version 1.2 brought with it the capability to read and write Microsoft Word files, and version 1.5 brough with the capability to read and write Microsoft Excel files and read Microsoft Powerpoint files.</p>\n\n<p>After two years, the eyeOS Team published eyeOS 1.0. eyeOS 1.0 introduced some new web technologies, like eyeSoft, a ports-based web software installation system &#8211; analogous to apt-get for Debian based Linux distributions. Version 1.0 also gave users the ability to develop new applications using eyeOS&#8217;s integrated IDE: eyeOS Toolkit. It can be installed through the eyeSoft system. This allows anyone to create their own repository for eyeOS and distribute  eyeOS Applications automatically to its users. </p>\n\n<p>eyeOS is being developed as a community effort with a company that provides professional services. The core team of developers is based out of Barcelona, Spain. </p>\n\n<p>Primary competitors: <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youOS\" title=\"YouOS\">YouOS</a>, <a
