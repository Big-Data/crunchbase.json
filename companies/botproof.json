And yet, this very same animation enables us to make the CAPTCHAs visually rich and supremely easy to read because the human mind is so much more complex than a computer.</p>\n\n<p>Humans are able to make out the numbers and letters, even though they are moving and changing.</p>\n\n<p>As bot capabilities evolve, as we fully expect them to do, we simply serve out a new style of animation rendering any specific bot attack harmless.
