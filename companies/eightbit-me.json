The first idea was to use images with very few selections and to use pure HTML / JS to create the characters.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by an 8-bitted Dribbble post by UK artist and designer Harry Harrison, San Francisco interactive designers Addison Kowalski, Amadeus Demarzi and Courtney Guertin took the idea to the next level by 8 bit-ing their Twitter avatars, which inevitably went viral among the tech set. Eightbit.me is the result.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0011/7113/117113v4-max-150x150.png"],[[231,34],"assets/images/resized/0011/7113/117113v4-max-250x250.png"],[[231,34],"assets/images/resized/0011/7113/117113v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Courtney","last_name":"Guertin","permalink":"courtney-guertin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/9091/109091v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/9091/109091v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[429,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/9091/109091v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Addison","last_name":"Kowalski","permalink":"addison-kowalski","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/8942/48942v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/8942/48942v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[252,252],"assets/images/resized/0004/8942/48942v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Amadeus","last_name":"Demarzi","permalink":"amadeus-dermazi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Music Maker","person":{"first_name":"Torley","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"torley-wong","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6587/26587v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/6587/26587v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/6587/26587v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Ravenelle Zugzwang / <a href=\"http://ravenelle.net\" title=\"Ravenelle&#8217;s blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ravenelle&#8217;s blog</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Amadeus","last_name":"Demarzi","permalink":"amadeus-demarzi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/1744/121744v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/1744/121744v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/1744/121744v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sAJas-q2BOA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sAJas-q2BOA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/20713468\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/20713468\">Introducing EightBit.Me</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user6224166\">eightbitme</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Eightbit.me lets you make a virtual 8-bit style version of you that helps you keep track of the places, people, and things in your life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic by Torley <br />\r\nhttp://torley.com<br />\r\n</p>","description":"<p>Eightbit.me Trailer</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
