We help brands cut through the clutter and build trust with their customers by recognizing and acting upon their individual interests.  </p>\n\n<p>Sailthru&#8217;s Horizon technology creates individual user profiles associated with each person&#8217;s email address and online behavior.  Our algorithms gauge each individual user&#8217;s intent and match appropriate content and frequency of email communications such that every email is tailored to the unique user.  That means we send as many permutations of an email as there are recipients.  All simultaneously, all automated and all in real time.  </p>\n\n<p>Our Concierge and Scout products take personalized communications one step further by linking the user data to serve up individualized content recommendations on site.    </p>\n\n<p>Sailthru has helped over 200 well-known publishers and ecommerce companies, including AOL/Huffington Post, Business Insider, Daily Beast/Newsweek, Fab.com, FlavorPill, Oscar de la Renta, and Thrillist, turn their email lists into strategic, value-driving assets.  What weâ€™ve found is that capturing interests early on and deepening the engagement of each user over time extends the customer lifetime value and increases ROI.
