The company is headquartered in Houston, Texas.  </p>\n\n<p>At the core of the company&#8217;s analytics practice is the Matrix for Business platform, a web-based data analysis, exploration, and reporting application. It can be deployed on-site or as a SAAS.  Currently it binds with cloud-based datasources such as SalesForce and local SQL-based business systems. The application has three tiers for data exploration consisting of executive dashboards (KPIs and pivot charting), a tabular analysis tier, and lastly a granular data level tier. Views can also be integrated seamlessly into Microsoft SharePoint.</p>\n\n<p>The application provides a web-based database exploration tool, styled similar to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and can be used to visually build SQL queries for custom views, exported for reporting, or back into SSMS.  </p>\n\n<p>Reports can be exported to Excel or shared via email and stored as favorites. The system also integrates with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) allowing users to analyze and drill-down through existing reports.  </p>\n\n<p>The company also provides custom content-managed web site development, leveraging SharePoint and Dot Net Nuke (DNN).  In addition, it offers clients full vertical network/server, desktop support and monitoring.  </p>\n\n<p>Channel Dynamix is a Certified Microsoft Partner, Platinum Rackspace Partner, SalesForce Partner, VMWare Certified, and Steelcase BlueShare Provider.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,32],"assets/images/resized/0008/9941/89941v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,32],"assets/images/resized/0008/9941/89941v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,32],"assets/images/resized/0008/9941/89941v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Brysch","permalink":"dave-brysch","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"GoodData","permalink":"good-data","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,20],"assets/images/resized/0001/9439/19439v8-max-150x150.png"],[[112,20],"assets/images/resized/0001/9439/19439v8-max-250x250.png"],[[112,20],"assets/images/resized/0001/9439/19439v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"PivotLink","permalink":"pivotlink-formerly-seatab","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/7899/27899v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/7899/27899v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/7899/27899v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Indicee","permalink":"indicee","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/4814/64814v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0006/4814/64814v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,151],"assets/images/resized/0006/4814/64814v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Rackspace Hosting","permalink":"rackspace-hosting","image":null}},{"title":"Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Amazon Web Services","permalink":"amazon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1415 N.
