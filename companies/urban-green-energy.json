After the wildly successful launch of the eddy turbine, UGE introduced a larger vertical axis wind turbine, eddy GT, both in 2010.</p>\n\n<p>UGE turbines can be assembled in under an hour and be mounted on either a pole or a rooftop for safe, reliable energy.  The grid-tie technology means that on very blustery days, customers will actually be able to sell power back to their utility companies. </p>\n\n<p>Like the rest of the Urban Green Energy line up, eddy GT qualifies for a 30% US federal rebate and may qualify for additional rebates and/or tax incentives on the state level. The investment in an eddy GT is also a sound one; the turbine has a maximum safe wind speed of more than 120mph (55 m/s), and an engineered lifetime of 20 years.  </p>\n\n<p>UGE has also extended its product line into applications of its wind turbines.  It partnered with GE in 2011 to design an electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya Skypump, and also added two distinct hybrid streetlamps to its product line-up.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0011/7246/117246v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0011/7246/117246v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,156],"assets/images/resized/0011/7246/117246v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"chief executive, founder","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Blitterswyk","permalink":"nick-blitterswyk","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"330 W 38th St., Suite 1103","address2":"","zip_code":"10018","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
