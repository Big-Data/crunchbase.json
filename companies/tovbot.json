Our goal is to foster a new paradigm of personal robots that interact with humans on the most personal level.  </p>\n\n<p>Our strategy is to combine exciting trends in technology – cloud computing, omnipresent networks, advanced smartphones – with our own hard-earned robotics knowhow to deliver the most advanced and compelling personal robotics products the world has ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>Our first product – Shimi – is a robotic musical companion. With its high quality 6 watt speakers, 5 degrees of freedom, and the brain of a smartphone, Shimi will dance to the beat of any song, respond to your voice, taps, and gestures, learn your musical taste, and recommend new music to you. Look at Shimi as the most expressive and musically intelligent speaker dock you have ever met.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0020/8078/208078v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0020/8078/208078v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,152],"assets/images/resized/0020/8078/208078v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Guy","last_name":"Hoffman","permalink":"guy-hoffman-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Campbell","permalink":"ian-campbell-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/9403/199403v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0019/9403/199403v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0019/9403/199403v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Designer","person":{"first_name":"Guy","last_name":"Hoffman","permalink":"guy-hoffman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Aimi","permalink":"roberto-aimi","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"75 5th St.","address2":"","zip_code":"30308","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Raised $500,000.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":25,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"Angel","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Tovbot","permalink":"tovbot"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style='text-align:center'>\r\n\r\n<object width='430' height='272' id='FiveminPlayer' classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000'>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowfullscreen' value='true'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='movie' value='http://embed.5min.com/517475103/'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='wmode' value='opaque' />\r\n\r\n<embed name='FiveminPlayer' src='http://embed.5min.com/517475103/' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='430' height='272' allowfullscreen='true' allowScriptAccess='always' wmode='opaque'>\r\n\r\n</embed>\r\n\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n</div>","description":"<p>Tovbot Demo at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2012</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
