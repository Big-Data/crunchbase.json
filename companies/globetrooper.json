Anyone can publish a trip or join a trip. Trips range from weekend drives across the US to year-long adventures to all seven continents.</p>\n\n<p>Globetrooper has supported numerous highly-publicised expeditions. For example, a 20-person 12,000km circumnavigation of India by rail. There was no tour guide or company. The group met on Globetrooper, made plans over the course of a year, then met in India to depart. Another example is a 13-person 1,000 mile trek across the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. The group was supported by camels and local interpreters.</p>\n\n<p>Globetrooper trips tend not to require specific skills or extraordinary ability.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/3361/143361v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/3361/143361v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0014/3361/143361v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Sullivan","permalink":"todd-sullivan-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"McLeod","permalink":"lauren-mcleod","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"McLeod","permalink":"lauren-mcleod-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,124],"assets/images/resized/0019/2112/192112v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[124,124],"assets/images/resized/0019/2112/192112v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[124,124],"assets/images/resized/0019/2112/192112v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
