LineStream has developed software that will dramatically improve control over automated processes, enhancing performance in equipment found everywhere from manufacturing plants to households. This is a multi-billion dollar market opportunity to replace the current standard, called PID control, that has been in use for over 50 years with little innovation.  In partnership with leading chip and controller providers, LineStream will deploy its software into products ranging from industrial equipment to washing machines. </p>\n\n<p>Control algorithms, encoded in software, are implemented to sustain desired operational performance in automated products.  PID Controls are the industry standard control algorithm, used in over 97% of control loops.  With PID controls, product design and calibration areis a lengthy and imprecise trial-and-error processes.  Once products are deployed, PID controls are slow to react to errors such as vibration and friction that can cause equipment to move outside specified parameters.  LineStreamâ€™s controls solve both of these problems by slashing setup time and drastically reducing errors.  This results in shorter design cycles, sustainable product performance, and dramatic energy savings.</p>\n\n<p>LineStream&#8217;s Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) technology is the result of a ten-year development effort at the Center for Advanced Controls at Cleveland State University (CSU, Cleveland, OH).  </p>\n\n<p>ADRC powers SpinTAC and InTAC, LineStream&#8217;s flagship products, which provide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid implementation: Reduces tuning time from months to hours</li>\n<li>Optimized performance: Enables and sustains ideal product functionality </li>\n<li>Enhanced efficiency: Cuts energy consumption by as much as 50% </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>LineStream&#8217;s competitive advantage is enhanced by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deployable, scalable software which is embedded and protected</li>\n<li>Numerous deployment methods which enable diverse partnership opportunities </li>\n<li>First to market with versatile, easy-to-tune, advanced controls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Key Milestones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Signed a 15-year license agreement with Texas Instruments.  Cumulative 5-year revenue is $40M, total NPV exceeds $100M.</li>\n<li>Reduced energy consumption by 57% in a Parker Hannifin plant implementation.</li>\n<li>Delivered up to 50% motor efficiency and accuracy improvement in independent testing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>LineStream is poised to disrupt the controls landscape, which for decades has been stagnant.  With a Fortune 200 strategic partner, transformative control technology, and software that is ready to deploy immediately, LineStream represents a uniquely attractive, capital-efficient and quickly-scalable investment opportunity offering tens of billions of dollars of economic value to its end use markets annually. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0014/5808/145808v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0014/5808/145808v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0014/5808/145808v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Zhiqiang Gao","permalink":"dr-zhiqiang-gao","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Gang","last_name":"Tian","permalink":"gang-tian","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Zilli","permalink":"matt-zilli","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Neundorfer","permalink":"david-neundorfer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/7434/187434v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/7434/187434v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[271,325],"assets/images/resized/0018/7434/187434v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Martahus","permalink":"craig-martahus","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"George Walker","permalink":"dr-george-walker","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Petras","permalink":"jim-petras","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6833/46833v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,234],"assets/images/resized/0004/6833/46833v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,234],"assets/images/resized/0004/6833/46833v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Ziebelman","permalink":"peter-ziebelman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal counsel (Corporate) ","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Thompson Hine","permalink":"thompson-hine","image":null}},{"title":"Legal counsel (IP)","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Turocy & Watson","permalink":"turocy-watson","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.esplp.com/linestream.aspx","source_description":"","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Early Stage Partners","permalink":"early-stage-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/6832/46832v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[123,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/6832/46832v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[123,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/6832/46832v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/03/linestream-technologies-closes-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"LineStream Technologies Closes Series B Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":12,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"U.S. Venture Partners","permalink":"u-s-venture-partners-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-150x150.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-250x250.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Early Stage Partners","permalink":"early-stage-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/6832/46832v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[123,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/6832/46832v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[123,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/6832/46832v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1468 W 9th St ","address2":"Ste 100","zip_code":"44113","city":"Cleveland","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2011/07/linestream_technologies_signs.html","title":"July 12 Cleveland Plain Dealer"}]}
