The proprietary technology enables the manufacture of biologically-active plastics from blood plasma for treating injuries to bone and connective tissue. These plastics are sterile, off-the-shelf, easy to handle, shape and suture, have controlled degradation rates, contain known levels of bioactivity, and exhibit mechanical properties designed to match the repaired tissue. Carmellâ€™s plastics can be simply viewed as plastic forms of ultra-concentrated blood clots; they therefore represent the ideal biomaterials, using the bodyâ€™s own growth and regenerative factors to naturally promote tissue healing. The Company is focused on the sports medicine market, with products designed to accelerate healing and produce better clinical outcomes in treating injuries to connective tissue (e.g., tendons, ligaments and cartilage).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/0090/70090v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,80],"assets/images/resized/0007/0090/70090v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[215,80],"assets/images/resized/0007/0090/70090v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.53M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":130000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":31,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse","permalink":"pittsburgh-life-sciences-greenhouse","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/7564/47564v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,158],"assets/images/resized/0004/7564/47564v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,158],"assets/images/resized/0004/7564/47564v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/print-edition/2011/04/15/carmell-therapeutics-raises-3-million.html","source_description":"Carmell Therapeutics raises $3 million ","raised_amount":2400000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Harbor Light Capital Partners","permalink":"light-capital-partners","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Newlin Investment Company","permalink":"newlin-investment-company","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse","permalink":"pittsburgh-life-sciences-greenhouse","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/7564/47564v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,158],"assets/images/resized/0004/7564/47564v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,158],"assets/images/resized/0004/7564/47564v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Innovation Works","permalink":"innovation-works","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/9298/29298v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/9298/29298v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/9298/29298v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Ariel Savannah Angel Partners","permalink":"ariel-savannah-angel-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0021/3317/213317v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,72],"assets/images/resized/0021/3317/213317v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[179,72],"assets/images/resized/0021/3317/213317v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Blue Tree Allied Angels","permalink":"blue-tree-allied-angels","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0021/4013/214013v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,128],"assets/images/resized/0021/4013/214013v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[297,153],"assets/images/resized/0021/4013/214013v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"10 South Tower","address2":"320 E.
