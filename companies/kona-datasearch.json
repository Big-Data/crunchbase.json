Advanced search techniques include spell correction, synonym and acronym matching, field-level searching, hit highlighting and more. Users will find what they&#8217;re looking for the first time and can spend more time selling, less time searching. Since users never have to leave their Salesforce environment to find relevant information, Salesforce adoption improves dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>KonaSearch searches all Salesforce objects and fields, including custom objects, attachments/documents and Chatter. External sources include content management systems such as Microsoft SharePoint, email systems such as Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes, websites, and local file directories. Future versions will search content in traditional applications like Siebel CRM and cloud-based applications like Box.net, FinancialForce, Jobscience and Workday.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0016/4253/164253v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0016/4253/164253v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0016/4253/164253v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"AVG","permalink":"avg","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"20A Northwest Blvd.","address2":"","zip_code":"03063","city":"Nashua","state_code":"NH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0016/4252/164252v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0016/4252/164252v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,236],"assets/images/resized/0016/4252/164252v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/txWBwJ","title":"Using Search to Improve Sales"}]}
