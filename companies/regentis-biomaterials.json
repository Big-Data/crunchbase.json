The company’s core technology is a iodegradable hydrogel called Gelrin™. It is based on polyethylene glycol diacrylate and denatured fibrinogen originally developed at the Technion University by Dr. Dror Seliktar. The Gelrin hydrogel platform combines the stability and versatility of a synthetic material with the bio-functionality of a natural substance for a range of clinical applications and has undergone extensive preclinical and safety testing over the last few years. The company’s flagship product, GelrinC™, designed for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions, is currently in clinical trials.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0018/9772/189772v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,68],"assets/images/resized/0018/9772/189772v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,68],"assets/images/resized/0018/9772/189772v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alastair","last_name":"J.
