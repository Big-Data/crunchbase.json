Valencellâ€™s HealthsetÂ® platform integrates vital signs sensors directly into music earbuds and audio headsets already used by tens of millions of consumers \nwhile exercising. HealthsetÂ® powered earbuds track real-time heart rate, calories burned, steps taken, distance traveled, speed, and other physiological metrics while consumers listen to music, talk over the phone, or go about daily life activities. This data is streamed to phones and mp3-players through wired \nor wireless links, enabling live body metrics, training, and coaching via fitness applications on mobile devices and online. The application of Valencellâ€™s technologies span across multiple markets including consumer mobile, fitness, gaming, mHealth, and personal protection equipment (PPE). </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0014/0146/140146v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0014/0146/140146v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[285,66],"assets/images/resized/0014/0146/140146v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110620005567/en/Valencell-Announces-5.5-Million-Series-Venture-Financing","source_description":"Valencell, Inc.
