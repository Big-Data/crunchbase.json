The collected data is wirelessly uploaded to\na website where the wearer can see their data and track their progress toward personal goals. The website provides a motivational interface where users can share their progress, compare themselves against similar people and work toward virtual goals with their friends, family and\nco-workers. At the website, users can also manually log nutrition,\nweight and other health information in order to gain a complete\npicture of their health.</p>\n\n<p>Fitbit makes it easy to achieve a healthy
