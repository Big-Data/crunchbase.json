And itâ€™s an overwhelming chase to find just about everything right to match our right wardrobe. While a perfect silhouette can make us look like a million bucks, an accessory on the other hand can simply enhance our wardrobe a notch higher. When we talk about accessories, a handbag is something that we certainly cannot ignore. A â€˜bagâ€™ has the power to make or break our style statement. So, while youâ€™re wondering what to buy this weekend we bring you a range of exclusive hand painted leather bags which will uplift your mood by instantly adding a splash of colour.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2010, Vakaro aims at making an impression in the hearts and minds of the urban women. Armed with a team of talented designers and artists, it not only crafts beautiful leather bags, it indeed creates art on them. Vakaro offers a range of leather shoulder bags, hand bags and clutches which are unique and vibrant in its own individual way.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The bags are made from full grain drum dyed naked leather. Most of the bags are individually hand painted with acrylic paint, by the artists who try and give a different look to every single bag. They are also fitted with solid metal buckles and bolts that hold the leather together and gives an assurance of durability,â€ says Entrepreneur Praneeth Kumar who is inspired by the art and artists of India.  Praneeth is now working on a concept of &#8216;Midnight Black&#8217; where he wants to  individually paint all the bags. â€œIn this collection we will use a reverse process where we will keep the base of the leather black and then do the art work on them,&#8221; he says, who wants to start painting Cleopatra on his bags soon.  Each bag is created with individual attention and is treated like a first born at Vakaro.</p>\n\n<p>The artists take around three to four days to hand paint the leather.The urban women are strong, independent and have a knack for rare things. Our designer leather handbags are designed for every occasion and event. You will find leather handbags of every style, color and size,â€ says Praneeth adding that no designs are replicated as they want every customer to own an unique piece.  â€œWe value our customersâ€™ needs and thus strive hard to satisfy them. We want our customers to keep coming back and thus we have dedicated ourselves to perfect the details of every handbag and wallet that we manufacture,â€ he says.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0014/1220/141220v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0014/1220/141220v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,351],"assets/images/resized/0014/1220/141220v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
