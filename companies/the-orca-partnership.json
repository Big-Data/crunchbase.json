Looking back, it has been a great ride with lots of terrific clients, bright colleagues and even a few scoundrels thrown in just to keep it interesting.</p>\n\n<p>During all this time, weâ€™ve stayed true to our four-step ORCA process:</p>\n\n<p>O-rganization</p>\n\n<p>R-esearch</p>\n\n<p>C-reativity</p>\n\n<p>A-ction</p>\n\n<p>Our White Room intake sessions are now widely-imitated (but, never duplicated) and weâ€™ve even spawned two competitors from our own ranks. We wish them well.</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™ve seen a lot of changes in marketing, the role of technology and in client needs.</p>\n\n<p>But the more things change, the more they remain the same.</p>\n\n<p>The same needs still exist. The same intellectual prowess is still required to look through the numbers and see and understand the human behavior behind them.</p>\n\n<p>Experience and expertise is still the essence of successful marketing strategy.</p>\n\n<p>ORCA enjoys a well-deserved reputation for taking ideas from brain to brands\nwith positioning and selling concepts that endure in the marketplace for decades.</p>\n\n<p>We invite you to examine not only our work, but also the O-R-C-A process and the intellectual prowess that powers it.</p>\n\n<p>Our own Value Proposition will tell you more about us, our values and culture.</p>\n\n<p>If you like what you read and hear about ORCA, email or call us and letâ€™s see how we can be of service to your company.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"W.
