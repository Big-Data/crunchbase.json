It is part search engine, part research library, part organizer, part marketing platform, and part town square.</p>\n\n<p>The genesis of the idea for the company came when some Singaporean and American entrepreneurs found each other, by serendipity, on the Internet. They discovered that they shared a common vision: to organize disparate information from around the community in a logical way that helps busy people make intelligent decisions when it comes to purchasing homes, searching for rentals, or buying retail goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>At StreetSine, we believe that Singapore, of all the worldâ€™s international cities, is the most attractive place to launch an information marketplace. Singapore, itself, is well-organized, self-contained, and multi-cultural. In addition, the Singaporean government has created a transparent environment where consumers and businesses can flourish together. With these characteristics already in place, it is possible to map the many bits of retail information floating around Singapore into a succinct and organized marketplace in cyberspace.</p>\n\n<p>An information marketplace, like StreetSine, would not have been possible a few years ago. Now, by combining large data sets, supercomputing, and newly-developed web-based software, StreetSine can give individuals insight into the retail consumer market previously unavailable or difficult to find. At the same time, businesses have the opportunity to aid consumers who are poised to buy because they are well-informed.</p>\n\n<p>Major Features.</p>\n\n<p>Vertical Search engine. One goal of StreetSine is to reduce the time that you need to search the Internet for relevant information on real estate and retail businesses. A general search engine, like Google or Yahoo, generates a random search. It leads to a URL that then requires you to search through the website in the hope of extracting pertinent information. When you are looking for specific information on housing or retail businesses, finding results in a general search engine is random, time-consuming, and often fails to yield sufficient information. It is also difficult and cumbersome to compare and contrast information from different websites.</p>\n\n<p>At StreetSine, we take the view that part of our role is to collate information from the community so that your search can be more precise and efficient. Consequently, StreetSine is not a general search engine but a micro-search engine. Using search windows, graphs, overlays, drop-down lists, and a map, you can very quickly access, organize, and analyze massive quantities of information that have been collected by StreetSine.</p>\n\n<p>Research library. Unlike retail information that you read in todayâ€™s newspaper and throw into the recycling bin the next day, information gathered on StreetSine creates a historical record that can be easily recalled. As a result, you now have a trusted site where you can research property trends, property listings, and businesses. For example, you can instantaneously create a graph that compares inflation with interest rates and housing prices for a specified period of time. Or you can look at historical price trends for a particular property type. Or compare a new property listing with recently transacted properties of similar characteristics. Or identify a neighborhood to buy a new home. Or find an interior designer or accountant that matches your needs. Or compare and contrast restaurants for a Saturday night outing. The list of things that one can research on StreetSine is very long, and everything is in one place.</p>\n\n<p>Organizer. In an information marketplace, it is essential for you to be able to process large quantities of micro-data so that you can make an informed decision. This must be done quickly, efficiently, and should draw on as many sources of information as possible. We believe the key to making an intelligent decision is organizing information that is not readily available to most people. Therefore, we have developed several innovations that form what we call the Community Positioning System (CPS). This system or platform consists of several features that organize vast amounts of information. There is a map, which serves as a visual aid and the primary reference point for everything performed on the site. The map acts as a cyber-desktop that allows the user to do his work while reaching for a pencil (MyControl Panel), a notebook (MyOrganizer), or a set of reference materials (MyResearch).</p>\n\n<p>MyControl Panel is a permanent fixture located on the right side of the map. From there, you can access property listings, price trends, research, business listings, rating surveys, forums, and post listings.</p>\n\n<p>MyOrganizer is the equivalent of an online notebook in which you can store and print information that pertains to your search and research. It is similar to an Internet shopping cart, only you add free information, instead of products, into the â€œcart.â€</p>\n\n<p>MyResearch is an interactive feature that allows you to construct graphs and browse charts, lists, and Heard on StreetSine. In addition, MyResearch is linked to other features in the CPS. For example, if a business uploads a promotion into its business listing, it will appear in Heard on StreetSine. Or, if you make a comment in one of the pop-up windows on the map, it will link to the appropriate category in Heard on StreetSine.</p>\n\n<p>None of these features in the CPS requires refreshing the page. Page refreshing is a waste of time that detracts from the task at hand.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, CPS is designed to make it easy for you to toggle back and forth between features without losing your grasp of the overall picture. MyOrganizer and MyResearch slide in and out of the viewing screen so that it is easy to move from the map to research to listings and back to MyOrganizer.</p>\n\n<p>Marketing platform. StreetSine provides opportunities for buyers to find sellers that will best meet their needs.</p>\n\n<p>On the property front, the content and technology on the site make StreetSine a superior platform for looking for homes. The site is interactive and generates qualified leads for listing agents by matching them with interested buyers or renters. The key to doing this is our superior search engine. Functions like nearby listings increase the probability of potential buyers finding the right listings. Functions like comparables help define the search so that when a buyer contacts the listing agent, he has done his homework and is ready to buy. That means a shorter period of home viewings, faster closings, and less house-hunting drama.</p>\n\n<p>On the business front, StreetSine offers owners a superior way to increase their web presence. The site provides retail businesses with a comprehensive and interactive listing platform to market their products. Not only can businesses customize the listings to support their marketing goals, they can also update them 24/7 to reflect product launches, promotions, or other information they wish to convey to consumers. On the flip side, consumers can easily identify and locate the businesses with whom they want to do business.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, StreetSine provides businesses with multiple channels to get their message out to an audience that is already searching for their goods and services. These channels include the search engine, business listings, links to the promotion section in Heard on StreetSine, instantaneous information feeds to subscribers, and Nearby Business Listings.</p>\n\n<p>Town Square. StreetSine employs Web 2.0 techniques to encourage user participation and collaboration, much like one would find among friends or in a town square. When you visit StreetSine, please contribute to the collective wisdom of all users by rating and evaluating businesses, exchanging neighborly advice on Heard on StreetSine, and by helping to create the StreetSine Quality Index (SQITM).</p>\n\n<p>SQITM is a StreetSine innovation that measures the quality of amenities, such as public transport and grocery stores in the different neighborhoods, for each consumer. For any location on the map, the index gives a personalized number rating based on your preferences, certain neighborhood statistics, proximity of the amenities, and fellow user ratings. The SQITM is calculated on the fly so that wherever you go on the map, you see an SQITM that takes into account your priorities. The SQITM is very helpful for people unfamiliar with a particular neighborhood or for those who are looking to compare and contrast different neighborhoods.\n.</p>\n\n<p>The Name</p>\n\n<p>The inspiration for StreetSine came from our belief that it is possible to organize disparate information from around Singapore in a way that helps busy people make intelligent decisions when it comes to purchasing homes, searching for rentals, or buying retail goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>The name StreetSine is a play on the noun â€œstreet signâ€ and reflects who we are and what we would like to accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of Street in StreetSine</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, we are about improving the publicâ€™s access to information about real estate, small businesses, and neighborhoods. We do not stop with national or district statistics. Instead, we make every effort to drill down, collecting and displaying information that helps people understand home price movements, amenities, and retail services at the street level, where they live. Therefore, we put the word â€œStreetâ€ in our name to convey our commitment to collecting information at the street level.</p>\n\n<p>But that is not the only reason we included Street in our name. If you think about it, streets connect the community. We hope that our site plays a similar role. To this end, we have included Web 2.0 applications like Heard on StreetSine and the StreetSine Quality IndexTM in an effort to encourage you to share your knowledge with your neighbors. By sharing information, all of us will have a better understanding of the property market, our neighborhoods, and the retail services that impact our lives every day.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of Sine in StreetSine</p>\n\n<p>We all know life is full of ups and downs.</p>\n\n<p>Markets go up and markets go down. The road ahead is not straight, but instead it is curved with blind spots.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot eliminate these curves. However, by being better informed, we can begin to smooth those ups and downs and make them, at the individual or street level, more predictable, like that of a sine wave.</p>\n\n<p>From our days studying trigonometry, we learned that sine waves can be found in many fields, including math and physics. We also learned that we can write an equation to represent a sine wave: y(t)=A*sin(wt+Î¸), where t is time, A is the amplitude of the wave, w is its frequency, and Î¸ is the phase.</p>\n\n<p>StreetSine is dedicated to writing equations that make better sense of the information that is floating around the property market and the community, so that the ups and downs that impact our personal decisions look more like a sine wave than a chaotic hodgepodge of squiggly lines.</p>\n\n<p>Street and Sine together as StreetSine</p>\n\n<p>StreetSine is a natural name for us, as it describes what we do. We are an information marketplace. We help people analyze information at the street level, by incorporating their input with other sources of data, in an effort to provide the clarity and predictability of a sine wave. Hence, our motto is Follow the Sine!</p>\n\n<p>Summary</p>\n\n<p>At StreetSine, we believe that an information marketplace can serve an important purpose in the community. This site can help buyers make intelligent choices while, at the same time, generating leads for sellers. Given todayâ€™s Internet standards and broadband penetration, it is now possible to create an organizing force around those disparate bits of information floating in the community and in cyberspace. It is our mission to help organize that information into ways that are meaningful for you, so that you can make decisions with as much information as possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/0247/30247v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/0247/30247v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[367,367],"assets/images/resized/0003/0247/30247v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Real Estate Lead Generation","permalink":"real-estate-lead-generation","image":null},{"name":"Real Estate Research","permalink":"real-estate-research","image":null},{"name":"Real Estate Alerts","permalink":"real-estate-alerts","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Lee Chuen Yang","permalink":"jeremy-lee-chuen-yang","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0003/0246/30246v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0003/0246/30246v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,273],"assets/images/resized/0003/0246/30246v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/Singapore/Real_Estate/prweb1296484.htm","title":"PRWeb release"}]}
