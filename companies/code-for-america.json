The first year of the fellowship program began in January 2011; 20 fellows were selected from 360 applicants, resulting in a 5.6% acceptance rate.</p>\n\n<p>The Code for America Accelerator recruits “civic startups” and supports them with a national platform to raise awareness, a wealth of business training and advice, and a broad network of potential investors and civic leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Founding &amp; History: In 2009, founder Jennifer Pahlka was working with O&#8217;Reilly Media at the Gov 2.0 Summit in Washington, DC. A conversation with Andrew Greenhill, the Mayorâ€™s Chief of Staff of the City of Tucson, sparked the initial idea for Code for America, when he said â€œYou need to pay attention to the local level because cities are in major crisis. Revenues are down, costs are up &#8211; if we don&#8217;t change how cities work, they&#8217;re going to fail.&#8221; The two began discussing plans for a program that eventually became Code for America, â€œa one-year fellowship recruiting developers to work for city government.â€ With support from web entrepreneur Leonard Lin, Tim O&#8217;Reilly of O&#8217;Reilly Media, and technologist Clay Johnson, among others, the organization was launched in September 2009.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0015/6758/156758v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,102],"assets/images/resized/0015/6758/156758v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,185],"assets/images/resized/0015/6758/156758v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
