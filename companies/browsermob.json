The on-demand testing services were formerly provided by BrowserMob, acquired by Neustar in 2010 and rebranded Neustar Web Performance Management. </p>\n\n<p>Neustarâ€™s on-demand load testing is built on top of cloud computing networks, such as Amazon EC2. Within minutes of signing up for a free trial, customers can begin testing.</p>\n\n<p>Neustar uses real browsers to deliver realistic load scenarios, all from the external perspective of a website visitor. Traditional load testing tools (commercial and open source) work by simulating the HTTP traffic seen by a browser. For rich, AJAX-based applications, this often requires complex scripting efforts. \nUtilizing the Selenium toolkit, Neustar bypasses this problem by automating the browser (rather than the HTTP traffic) and letting the browser make the appropriate HTTP requests. The result is a simple automation script and a more realistic load test.</p>\n\n<p>For more complex needs, Neustar offers full-service load testing, featuring a dedicated test engineer who manages the project start to finish. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to load testing services, Neustar offers website monitoring on the same platform, allowing customers to use the same Selenium-based script for monitoring and testing.  Neustar is the only web performance provider offering this convenience.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/7022/37022v4-max-150x150.png"],[[199,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/7022/37022v4-max-250x250.png"],[[199,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/7022/37022v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, BrowserMob","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Lightbody","permalink":"patrick-lightbody","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/7030/37030v2-max-150x150.png"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/7030/37030v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,300],"assets/images/resized/0003/7030/37030v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"Ferreira","permalink":"rafael-ferreira","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of User Experience","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"White","permalink":"ian-white-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/0185/60185v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/0185/60185v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,267],"assets/images/resized/0006/0185/60185v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Keynote Systems","permalink":"keynote-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0008/7802/87802v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0008/7802/87802v1-max-250x250.png"],[[256,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/7802/87802v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"AlertSite","permalink":"alertsite","image":{"available_sizes":[[[147,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/4999/94999v1-max-150x150.png"],[[147,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/4999/94999v1-max-250x250.png"],[[147,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/4999/94999v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Borland","permalink":"borland","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2599/22599v1-max-150x150.png"],[[135,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2599/22599v1-max-250x250.png"],[[135,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2599/22599v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Compuware Gomez","permalink":"compuware-gomez","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"AlertFox","permalink":"alertfox","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0004/2468/42468v4-max-150x150.png"],[[239,69],"assets/images/resized/0004/2468/42468v4-max-250x250.png"],[[239,69],"assets/images/resized/0004/2468/42468v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"20166","city":"Sterling","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":45.5324887,"longitude":-122.6864005}],"milestones":[{"description":"BrowserMob public launch","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":25,"source_url":"http://lightbody.net/blog/2008/11/browsermob-open-for-business.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"BrowserMob: Open for Business","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Neustar (formerly BrowserMob)","permalink":"browsermob"}},{"description":"Neustar acquires BrowserMob ","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://jaxenter.com/browsermob-acquired-by-neustar-27821.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"BrowserMob Acquired By Neustar","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Neustar (formerly BrowserMob)","permalink":"browsermob"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0003/7029/37029v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0003/7029/37029v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,444],"assets/images/resized/0003/7029/37029v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
