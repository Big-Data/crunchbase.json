The way this site works is straightforward enough, since all you have to do is upload a picture (or a couple) with you sporting the look that you need rated. You then provide some background information, and ask some specific questions that you want to have answered. Site users will then give you their own insight on that look that you had assembled. The will also give it either an up or a down vote, and that will be used to rate you on the provided Leader Board. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9928/99928v1-max-150x150.png"],[[179,59],"assets/images/resized/0009/9928/99928v1-max-250x250.png"],[[179,59],"assets/images/resized/0009/9928/99928v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brooke","last_name":"Moreland","permalink":"brooke-moreland","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Cropcho","permalink":"james-cropcho","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/2899/172899v2-max-150x150.png"],[[158,158],"assets/images/resized/0017/2899/172899v2-max-250x250.png"],[[158,158],"assets/images/resized/0017/2899/172899v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Anna Fischer</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CMO","person":{"first_name":"Ashley","last_name":"Granata","permalink":"ashley-granata","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/9916/189916v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/9916/189916v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[301,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/9916/189916v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"Crowley","permalink":"dennis-crowley","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0011/3420/113420v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0011/3420/113420v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0011/3420/113420v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>DennisCrowley.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"France","permalink":"chris-france","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4854/24854v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[230,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4854/24854v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[375,407],"assets/images/resized/0002/4854/24854v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Chicisimo","permalink":"chicisimo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0004/6874/46874v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0004/6874/46874v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0004/6874/46874v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Weardrobe","permalink":"weardrobe","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6711/16711v3-max-150x150.png"],[[243,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6711/16711v3-max-250x250.png"],[[243,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6711/16711v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-fashism-raises-1-million-to-grow-social-shopping-business/","source_description":"Fashism Raises $1 Million To Grow Social Shopping Business","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Rick","last_name":"Webb","permalink":"rick-webb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/0270/150270v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0015/0270/150270v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,195],"assets/images/resized/0015/0270/150270v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0009/9927/99927v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0009/9927/99927v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0009/9927/99927v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
