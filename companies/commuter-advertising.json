Additionally, Commuter Advertising encourages its advertisers to offer commuters an incentive, such as a discount or other offer with purchase. This mutually-beneficial relationship enables the continued success of all parties involved: commuters, public transit authorities, and advertisers alike. </p>\n\n<p>Commuter Advertising is headquartered in Dayton, Ohio, and operates in cities around the United States, including: Chicago and Champaign, IL; Toledo and Dayton, OH; Kansas City, Missouri; Jacksonville, FL; and Rockland County, NY. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0021/3492/213492v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[242,91],"assets/images/resized/0021/3492/213492v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[242,91],"assets/images/resized/0021/3492/213492v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"714 E.
