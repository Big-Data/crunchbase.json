Because these apps are free… YOU ARE THE PRODUCT NOT THE CUSTOMER!! Your personal information is being sold to advertisers to monetize these SO CALLED FREE applications.</p>\n\n<p>NOTHING IN THE WORLD IS FREE….</p>\n\n<p>You sort through 1,000,000+ web &amp; mobile apps to find which of them may be right for you, your family, or business. You sign up for and/or you download the apps and services, you try to use them your way to fit your life, but quickly find out they come with no support, no one to call, no training, and not much flexibility to customize them to your individual lifestyle and needs. When you can customize them it&#8217;s confusing and frustrating. Then you just stop using them at all.</p>\n\n<p>Go ahead. Try to call Facebook, Google, or Twitter etc….. They don’t have phone support to help you. They are too busy selling your information to advertisers to help you be successful using their apps. Gotta please all those investors you know. Show me the money! We think no… SHOW US THE SUPPORT!! Show us a GREAT User Experience!!</p>\n\n<p>VirtuallyMagic can help.</p>\n\n<p>We have an American Army of Digital Natives. People who grew up with this technology. Agents who are trained, certified, and ready to help you improve your user experience with your digital lifestyle or business needs. In person, at your service. Not remotely from another country. Using people who are available only over the phone, or remotely via the web like most large companies today who are using outsourcing/off-shoring to India, China, and the Philippines to save them money, increase their profits and at the cost American jobs.</p>\n\n<p>At VirtuallyMagic, We take your user experience with your information and technology very personal. </p>\n\n<p>The web and mobile world today is a big and scary place filled with self serving companies, deceptive advertisers, spies, hackers, scammers, bullies, pedophiles, and identity thieves. Today you need to take care of you, your family’s, and your business&#8217;s digital lives the same way you take care of your car, your home, and your healthcare with regular check ups, tune ups, preventative maintenance, and insurance from someone you can trust. Your Independent Digital Agent. This is just what VirtuallyMagic provides for you. Trust, Safety, Security, Monitoring, and peace of mind in the 21st century.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0020/6647/206647v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0020/6647/206647v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,207],"assets/images/resized/0020/6647/206647v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Larry","last_name":"Stone","permalink":"larry-stone-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"555 Bryant St. #594","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
