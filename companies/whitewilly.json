The odds of finding someone who has what you want and wants what you have is statistically boring.    Whitewilly.com allows you to use your items like money and make offers linking all offers made to you to this new item of desire.</p>\n\n<p>Once trades are accepted, the site becomes a mini Wall Street trading platform.  working with the virtual ownership of the new item you can re-trade it away  (Without ever touching it) perhaps hundreds of times until you can arrive at the item you really want.</p>\n\n<p>The site charges only a small listing fee, is free to join, has no advertising from the outside but allows you to purchase advertising for your items to promote them on the site to attract offers.</p>\n\n<p>The site is easy to use.  If it has a flaw, it is capable of so much it is hard to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>The name comes from the white elephant item,  a gift or object that has no usefulness to the current owner but still has great value.   You dont want to get stuck with one while trading and you can get rid of one by bartering it away.   Willy just sounded a little catchy and fun.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner, creator","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Bialk","permalink":"john-bialk-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Nothing just like it","permalink":"nothing-just-like-it","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"owners cash","raised_amount":3000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"john","last_name":"bialk","permalink":"john-bialk","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
