The company has developed a fundamentally new method of encoding music as performance data rather than audio. This performance data is easily transformed in a number of ways, enabling users of Zenph products â€“ professionals, hobbyists, students, and listeners â€“ to participate in compelling, interactive musical experiences. The companyâ€™s re-performanceÂ® process was called â€œa technological miracleâ€ by The Wall Street Journal and one of the â€œBest Ideas of the Yearâ€ by The New York Times Magazine. Zenphâ€™s recordings have received multiple GRAMMYÂ® nominations, and its Rachmaninoff Plays Rachmaninoff album on Sony Masterworks was described by the editor of Stereophile Magazine as â€œperhaps the finest piano recording I have heard.â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0016/3355/163355v2-max-150x150.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0016/3355/163355v2-max-250x250.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0016/3355/163355v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
