Prophet is currently used by more than 12,000 companies worldwide, and that number is growing everyday. Avidian offers an on-premise version, Prophet 5, a hosted version, Prophet OnDemand, and a mobile version, Prophet Mobile. Compared to other CRM providers, Prophet has three key differentiators:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Built into Outlook: Prophet is built into Outlook, meaning users donâ€™t need to flip between two applications on a regular basis or manage multiple contact databases. Prophet integrates so seamlessly with Outlook, that it feels like the e-mail application simply has additional features and functionality. As a result, employees donâ€™t need to spend time familiarizing themselves with an entirely different application.</p></li>\n<li><p>Built within the .Net platform: Providing Prophet on the .NET platform means it is integrated at the object level with Outlook. It also allows easy extension into other parts of a business. In addition, users can easily share Prophet and Outlook information with other applications.</p></li>\n<li><p>Built to leverage existing Outlook data: Prophet turns Outlook data into the building blocks of an effective sales management solution. Every e-mail sent, meeting appointment made or task created can be viewed, tracked and associated with an opportunity. This increases information organization and ease of finding critical pieces of opportunity information.</p></li>\n</ol>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[62,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/2478/22478v2-max-150x150.png"],[[62,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/2478/22478v2-max-250x250.png"],[[62,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/2478/22478v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"james-wong","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Barbara","last_name":"Huang","permalink":"barbara-huang","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CIO","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Nguyen","permalink":"tim-nguyen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Warren","last_name":"Stokes","permalink":"warren-stokes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Digital Strategist","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Fasser","permalink":"scott-fasser-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/9164/159164v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[170,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/9164/159164v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[306,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/9164/159164v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>scott fasser</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ACT","permalink":"act","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1788/21788v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/1788/21788v1-max-250x250.png"],[[306,109],"assets/images/resized/0002/1788/21788v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Siebel Systems","permalink":"siebel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/7824/17824v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/7824/17824v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/7824/17824v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"SugarCRM","permalink":"sugarcrm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0000/3001/3001v3-max-150x150.png"],[[216,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3001/3001v3-max-250x250.png"],[[216,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3001/3001v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"2053 152nd Ave NE","address2":"","zip_code":"98052","city":"Redmond","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":47.628895,"longitude":-122.138507}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
