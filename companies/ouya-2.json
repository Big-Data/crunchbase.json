Julie and an initial team of game developers and advisors brought the concept to life with the help of Yves Behar and the fuseproject, and took it to Kickstarter in July of 2012. It became one of the most successful Kickstarter projects ever, with tens of thousands of backers pledging to help bring OUYA to life. OUYA’s first consoles will ship in early 2013.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/5392/205392v1-max-150x150.png"],[[157,64],"assets/images/resized/0020/5392/205392v1-max-250x250.png"],[[157,64],"assets/images/resized/0020/5392/205392v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$8.6M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/this-little-99-box-was-raising-1000-every-minute-just-before-its-86-million-campaign-closed-2012-8","source_description":"This Little $99 Box Just Raised $8.6 Million To Crush The Xbox","raised_amount":8600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":9,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Kickstarter","permalink":"kickstarter","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"11693 San Vicente Blvd., #551","address2":"","zip_code":"90049","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
