Even churches, music bands and smaller publications like Racer X have successfully created their own apps.</p>\n\n<p>Making an app with AppMakr is absolutely free, and your app can be in the App Store within days.</p>\n\n<p>AppMakr has developed the App Quality Index (http://go.AppMakr.com/AQI), a proprietary algorithm to predict with 90% accuracy whether Apple will accept or reject your app. You don&#8217;t have to wait days or weeks to hear back from Apple.</p>\n\n<p>You can put RSS into your app (text, images, podcasts, audio, video) as well as GeoRSS and MediaRSS feeds. You can also put HTML into your app, which is served locally from the phone and can access the phone&#8217;s camera, accelerometer and much more. Your options are limitless, and you can make great apps this way.</p>\n\n<p>Here are just a few of the thousands of apps made using AppMakr:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>PBS NewsHour: http://go.AppMakr.com/PBS</p></li>\n<li><p>Newsweek ($1.99): http://go.AppMakr.com/Newsweek</p></li>\n<li><p>PGA TOUR&#8217;s Greenbrier Classic: http://go.AppMakr.com/Greenbrier</p></li>\n<li><p>Harvard Business Review ($2.99): http://go.AppMakr.com/HBR</p></li>\n<li><p>RacerX: http://go.AppMakr.com/RacerX</p></li>\n<li>Macworld UK ($9.99): http://go.AppMakr.com/Macworld</li>\n<li>Maclife: http://go.AppMakr.com/Maclife</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are thousands moreâ€”take a look at our App Gallery for details: http://www.appmakr.com/app_gallery/</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-150x150.png"],[[175,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-250x250.png"],[[175,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"R.
