JobThread is focused on helping employers and recruiters reach candidates where they live online and helping publishers monetize their audience with recruitment advertising products.</p>\n\n<p>JobThread promises its users that it will take their job postings and distribute it to their applicable network of publishers making sure the right candidates see the post. It differentiates itself from other, more traditional job boards with targeting.  Their service cuts the &#8220;signal to noise ratio&#8221; and brings recruiters the most relevant resumes for the jobs they post. Because JobThread is posting the jobs on targeted niche sites, recruiters are less likely to get unqualified and irrelevant job responses and more likely to reach qualified, passive candidates.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/5594/15594v1-max-150x150.png"],[[190,96],"assets/images/resized/0001/5594/15594v1-max-250x250.png"],[[190,96],"assets/images/resized/0001/5594/15594v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Wies","permalink":"jason-wies","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Rod","last_name":"Garcia","permalink":"rod-garcia","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Yoon","permalink":"eric-yoon","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"CareerBuilder","permalink":"careerbuilder-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/0939/20939v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/0939/20939v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/0939/20939v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Simply Hired","permalink":"simply-hired","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/3571/3571v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0000/3571/3571v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[302,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/3571/3571v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"10007","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.7150928,"longitude":-74.0101816}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/6181/46181v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/6181/46181v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0004/6181/46181v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
