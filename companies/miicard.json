Above all, miiCard establishes a new level of trust between vendors and consumers in a digital marketplace. </p>\n\n<p>The internet world facilitates anonymity not trust.  Our challenge today when conducting business, fighting fraud and protecting the consumer is to create trust between business and consumer without resorting to physical offline identity validation. </p>\n\n<p>Every day between 70% and 90% of online financial transactions are abandoned. This happens the moment the customer is asked to complete the transaction offline by taking their driving license, passport or utility bill into their local bank branch.</p>\n\n<p>This offline stage, responding to Anti Money Laundering, Know Your Customer Regulations and the Proceeds of Crime Act, is a massive barrier to global trade and the market demands its elimination.</p>\n\n<p>miiCard introduces the concept of online trust for the first time, allowing customers to buy financial products completely online. </p>\n\n<p>miiCard is a digital passport for the consumer that proves I am who I say I am in real time to anti-money laundering standards and Know Your Customer Regulations and proceed of crime act without the need for physical ID.</p>\n\n<p>Owned and managed by the individual, miiCard allows the consumer to track, monitor and so take control of their online identity.</p>\n\n<p>miiCard will improve conversion rates, cut operational costs and fight internet fraud.</p>\n\n<p>miiCard is free for an individual to use with a vendor, allowing individuals to signup and use your miiCard to buy or access products and services on sites accepting miiCard identities.</p>\n\n<p>To use miiCard to prove you are who you say you are to others, such as on social networks or online auction and classifieds sites, you can activate your public profile page by subscribing to the service for USD $1.99 per month or $19.99 per year. </p>\n\n<p>Vendors are charged on a per-user transactional basis and setup fee. miiCard is a patent pending global solution, developed to anti-money laundering standards with support and assistance from Microsoft. </p>\n\n<p>miiCard supports the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,43],"assets/images/resized/0010/6358/106358v5-max-150x150.png"],[[146,43],"assets/images/resized/0010/6358/106358v5-max-250x250.png"],[[146,43],"assets/images/resized/0010/6358/106358v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Digital
