With Addroid, advertisers can create in-banner video ads for less than half of what it costs to create and serve traditional rich media ads (15 cents CPM vs. 40 cents CPM).</p>\n\n<p>The Addroid platform allows advertisers to build a video banner ad in as little as 30 seconds and eliminates the need to hand-code in Flash which saves time and money in the production process. And instead of having to â€œreinvent the wheelâ€ for a display campaign, Addroid allows advertisers to use their broadcast-quality video online, helping to maintain brand consistency and a high-quality experience across all platforms. </p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2010, Addroid is a privately-held company based in Los Angeles.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0013/3541/133541v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0013/3541/133541v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,167],"assets/images/resized/0013/3541/133541v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Los Angeles Office","address1":"8455 Beverly Blvd. #309","address2":"","zip_code":"90048","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/3540/133540v2-max-150x150.png"],[[218,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/3540/133540v2-max-250x250.png"],[[392,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/3540/133540v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.addroid.com/about","title":"Addroid FAQ"}]}
