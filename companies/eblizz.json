Users can interact both with the website content and their social network friends onsite and use the drag-and-drop function to share items, make recommendations, make purchases, collect photos etc.\nThe eblizz services include a social analytics platform designed to collect contextual data that is specific to a website&#8217;s audience, content and activities.  The analytics give companies a detailed snapshot of the user, how and where the content was spread, where purchases are made, and number of downloads.   This enables a company to effectively incorporate this data-mining into their WOM marketing strategy.\nThe focus of eblizz is to help companies with an online presence optimize the marketing power of the Social Web. </p>\n\n<p>Product Differentiation</p>\n\n<p>How do we differ from all the share buttons out there? The focus of share buttons is to grab a piece of content and push it to the userâ€™s stream, in essence attempting to syndicate that to as many users as possible. Use of share buttons started to gain momentum in 2009. What we see now, however, is that the user&#8217;s news feeds are spammed with content that becomes less and less relevant. eblizz has a different approach â€“ allowing brand sites and social networks to work together in a way that enables the social networks to become a part of each brand&#8217;s site and vice versa. \neblizz also makes it possible for users to share content in a fun way AND directly interact with their social network while on the companyâ€™s web site â€“ that is the key. They can, for example, read their news stream and drop a product from the site directly into the news stream or post comments. The idea is to keep them on a website as long as possible and to allow them to interact with the site&#8217;s content in an exciting way. \nAdditionally users can store the products they find in what is called the Shoebox. In the Shoebox they have a variety of options to manipulate the stored content and share from within the Shoebox.</p>\n\n<p>Revenue Model</p>\n\n<p>eblizz will generate revenue through a fixed-price models with monthly fees. Alternative pricing models such as commission-based revenue generation will be explored.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II â€“ Build-Out of Application\nThe Drag-and-Drop link below provides a video demonstration of the application that is in beta testing today.  eblizz seeks $500,000 for Second Stage financing to build out the application - here is a sneak peak of what is coming next:\nâ€¢ Making the core products stronger.  This will include the ability for live chat on a companyâ€™s website, meaning that users can directly chat with their facebook friends on the web site discussing the companyâ€™s products.\nâ€¢ Extend the companyâ€™s products to facebook itself, so products are showcased on facebook as part of a facebook application. Each user will, through his/her actions, automatically create a mini-shop that shows his/her favorite products.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,27],"assets/images/resized/0004/6173/46173v2-max-150x150.png"],[[113,27],"assets/images/resized/0004/6173/46173v2-max-250x250.png"],[[113,27],"assets/images/resized/0004/6173/46173v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Social Space","permalink":"social-space","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/President","person":{"first_name":"Jeanette","last_name":"Okwu","permalink":"jeanette-okwu","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1842/51842v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,188],"assets/images/resized/0005/1842/51842v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[157,188],"assets/images/resized/0005/1842/51842v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Wawrusch","permalink":"martin-wawrusch","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Alliance Counsel LLP","permalink":"alliance-counsel-llp","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$650k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":650000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Roman","last_name":"Scharf","permalink":"roman-scharf","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/8738/18738v3-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/8738/18738v3-max-250x250.png"],[[298,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/8738/18738v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.talenthouse.com\" title=\"Talenthouse Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talenthouse Inc.</a></p>"}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"eblizz, Inc.","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.0163012,"longitude":-118.4920896}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/LntdRqcVa5k&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/LntdRqcVa5k&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.piabo.net/en/principal.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.thestrategyweb.com/eblizz-the-next-social-shopping-extension","title":"eblizz - the next shopping extension"}]}
