Existing network architectures put one or more of these criteria in conflict, creating tradeoffs and making it impossible to satisfy all these criteria in a single network.</p>\n\n<p>Network Innovations Limited is now offering licenses for its patented Universal Network Architectureâ„¢. UNAâ„¢ (pronounced like the Spanish for â€˜oneâ€™) is an architecture for networks that outclass other networks in cost, environmental impact, investment protection, support for new services, efficiency, quality of service, scalability, reliability and security. Networks of UNAâ„¢ systems are called Universal Networksâ„¢.\nUniversal Networksâ„¢ deliver these benefits by incorporating a hybrid of circuit switching and multiprotocol packet switching that can provide either type of switching on demand and so is able deliver the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p>For large carriers, costs saved by implementing UNAâ„¢ could run to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Universal Networksâ„¢ also support superior virtual networks, making Networks-as-a-Service (NaaS) a compelling platform for offering managed and outsourced networks.\nUNAâ„¢ can be implemented in a wide range of equipment and devices, including routers, switches, motherboards, NICs, phones, gaming consoles. Universal Networksâ„¢ of all types and scales can be built: optical, electrical, wireline, wireless, national, metro, enterprise, data center unified fabric, MAN, WAN, LAN, even interconnect networks within servers, desktops and laptops.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0005/5640/55640v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,33],"assets/images/resized/0005/5640/55640v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/5640/55640v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Neil","last_name":"Freebairn","permalink":"neil-freebairn","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Patent prosecution","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"McDermott Will & Emery","permalink":"mcdermott-will-emery","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
