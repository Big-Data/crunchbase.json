vendors and service providers can use to deliver compelling applications and services into the connected home.</p>\n\n<p>4Home&#8217;s suite of solutions allows users to automate almost any application they want: remotely monitor their homes, get Web-based content on the TV, control home systems from their mobile phones, control all home devices and digital media in one unified user-interface, and track their home energy usage down to the device level. </p>\n\n<p>The company feels that &#8220;home control services&#8221; are the next suite of services to be offered by major broadband providers (after the trifecta of voice, video, and data), and consists of home monitoring, media &amp; entertainment management, home health, and energy management.</p>\n\n<p>4Home received five CES 2008 Innovation awards.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3034/3034v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3034/3034v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3034/3034v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"4Home
