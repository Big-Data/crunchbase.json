Online bargains in the form of flash sales and group deals are becoming increasingly popular in South Africa, and with discounts of up to 70%, itâ€™s no surprise that the trend is taking off.</p>\n\n<p>SaleWine.co.za is one such a site.  It sells its wines for up to 70% off the retail price and has attracted over 7000 shoppers who eagerly await its new wine emails.  </p>\n\n<p>â€œLast week, I bought two cases of 1992 Cabernet Sauvignon for R145 per bottle, which is 42% cheaper than the retail price of R250.  The fact that I only have 72 hours to buy the wine makes the prospect of purchasing that deal all the more exciting,â€ says asset manager Andrew Sawyer.</p>\n\n<p>Flash sale sites like SaleWine.co.za sell wines for a limited period.  In this case, 72 hours or until the wine is sold out.  </p>\n\n<p>â€œWe actually sold out of the 1992 Cabernet Sauvignon in less than 24 hours,â€ says AJ Ray, owner of SaleWine.co.za.  â€œI think the success of a flash sale site is firmly based on how well you can read your consumers and your ability to find exclusive deals that are somewhat scarce.  It takes time, and a lot of tasting to find wines that are good enough and special enough to offer our shoppers.â€</p>\n\n<p>SaleWine.co.za tastes around 90 wines per month but only chooses 16 to offer its shoppers.</p>\n\n<p>The business model seems to be working for the wine e-tailer, whose sales have doubled every month since it launched in the third quarter of 2010.  Its highest discount was 69% and its average is 49% off retail prices.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
