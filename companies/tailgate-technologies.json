The companyâ€™s mission is to change the way consumers interact with and buy services and products from advertisers, enabling advertisers to close the gap between marketing and sales.  Advertisers can benefit from 15 per cent customer interaction rates with a 1â€“3 per cent conversion rate, while site owners benefit from higher visitor retention rates as the consumer doesnâ€™t have to leave the site he or she is browsing in order to make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Tailgate Technologies is managed by young professionals with a clear vision and understanding of the advertising space. The company was founded by Christopher Autry, its current CEO, a veteran internet industry professional, management consultant and a one time biochemist.</p>\n\n<p>The company has partnered with leading brands such as the major Hollywood Studios, global retailers and third party agencies to promote their respective services and products to potential customers on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>How it works:</p>\n\n<p>Tailgate treats advertising as a self-contained application. This encompasses the entire electronic commerce value chain into a single unit and appears as a traditional Internet advertising banner, video or widget, but with the capability to perform secure financial transactions using payment gateways.</p>\n\n<p>Tailgateâ„¢, a patent pending technology, utilises standard Internet application platforms such as Flash or Ajax to create a presentation layer for the advertising content and proprietary techniques to securely communicate with the advertiserâ€™s electronic commerce database, as well as with the trusted payment gateway in use. The units provide 256-bit SSL security protocols in conjunction with numerous proprietary encryption protocols for each transaction, to guarantee the userâ€™s security and privacy. User information is never stored or held and is deleted in 90 seconds if the information is not processed by the receiving e-commerce provider. The security framework is fully PCI compliant and meets all international security standards. Additionally, California-based Verisign secures the secure socket layer connection from the units to the main e-commerce Web server and payment gateway used.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6470/26470v2-max-150x150.png"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/6470/26470v2-max-250x250.png"],[[449,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/6470/26470v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Tailgate","permalink":"tailgate","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Autry","permalink":"chris-autry","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/3383/43383v2-max-150x150.png"],[[207,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/3383/43383v2-max-250x250.png"],[[372,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/3383/43383v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"EVP Europe","person":{"first_name":"Blair","last_name":"Schooff","permalink":"blair-schooff","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Adgregate Markets","permalink":"adgregate-markets","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0002/4117/24117v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/4117/24117v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/4117/24117v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Bird and Bird","permalink":"bird-and-bird","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Howard Rice Nemerovski Canady Falk & Rabkin","permalink":"howard-rice-nemerovski-canady-falk-rabkin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/6896/16896v1-max-150x150.png"],[[192,111],"assets/images/resized/0001/6896/16896v1-max-250x250.png"],[[192,111],"assets/images/resized/0001/6896/16896v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mangrove Capital Partners","permalink":"mangrove-capital-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/2027/22027v1-max-150x150.png"],[[158,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/2027/22027v1-max-250x250.png"],[[158,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/2027/22027v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"8A Great Newport St","address2":"Soho","zip_code":"WC2H 7JA","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.511889,"longitude":-0.127743},{"description":"USA Office","address1":"8335 Sunset Blvd","address2":"Suite 210","zip_code":"90069","city":"West Hollywood","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.096359,"longitude":-118.371279}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/6469/26469v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/6469/26469v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,336],"assets/images/resized/0002/6469/26469v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/18187.asp","title":"Put the point of purchase on every PC"},{"external_url":"http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/18906.asp","title":"Is display advertising dead?"},{"external_url":"http://www.nma.co.uk/Articles/39587/Warner+Bros+plans+to+use+interactive+banners+after+trial.html","title":"Warner Brothers plan to use interactive banners after trial"},{"external_url":"http://www.netimperative.com/news/2008/september/02/tailgate-turns-banner-ads-into-points-of-sale","title":"Tailgate turns banner ads into points of sale"},{"external_url":"http://www.themarketingblog.co.uk/e_article001196133.cfm?x=b11,0,w","title":"Could online display advertising become both a marketing and a sales channel?"},{"external_url":"http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/-imedia-uk-display-advertising-renewed--driving-value-and-relevance-to-users_21134.html","title":"Display advertising renewed: driving value and relevance to users"},{"external_url":"http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/21038.asp","title":"Defragment your online display ads to create real value"}]}
