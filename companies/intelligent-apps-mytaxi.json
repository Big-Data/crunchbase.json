The geo location of the passenger is determined automatically and the taxi within shortest range to the passenger is notified. Complementary features include access to information about the taxi, the driver, the time of arrival and expected fare price ahead of the actual taxi ride. Prior to the arrival of the taxi, the user can track its position on a map on his Smartphone. In addition to the innovative Smartphone Application, myTaxi&#8217;s software platform revolutionizes the entire taxi industry with its disruptive, automatic order process i.e. the direct contact to the taxi driver for the passenger and autonomy from traditional switchboard operations. myTaxi is available in Germany, Austria and Australia. Many further European countries will follow in 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0021/7875/217875v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0021/7875/217875v2-max-250x250.png"],[[407,147],"assets/images/resized/0021/7875/217875v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Kuelper","permalink":"sven-klper","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Niclaus","last_name":"Mewes","permalink":"niclaus-mewes","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Get-a-Taxi","permalink":"get-a-taxi","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"GetTaxi","permalink":"get-taxi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0013/5971/135971v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0013/5971/135971v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,257],"assets/images/resized/0013/5971/135971v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Fms ","permalink":"fms","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Hailo","permalink":"hailo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,110],"assets/images/resized/0018/1832/181832v1-max-150x150.png"],[[108,110],"assets/images/resized/0018/1832/181832v1-max-250x250.png"],[[108,110],"assets/images/resized/0018/1832/181832v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€10M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/10/07/1touchtaxi-gets-an-extra-large-tip-from-t-venture-and-e42/","source_description":"1TouchTaxi gets an extra large tip from T-Venture and e42","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://mobilbranche.de/2011/06/mytaxi-will-ins-ausland-expandieren/2760","source_description":"myTaxi will ins Ausland expandieren","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/?p=486967","source_description":"Maker Of Taxi-Ordering App myTaxi Raises €10 Million From Daimler, Lars Hinrichs","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":23,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"car2go","permalink":"car2go-2","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarter","address1":"Grosse Elbstr. 273","address2":"","zip_code":"22767","city":"Hamburg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0015/5806/155806v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0015/5806/155806v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,132],"assets/images/resized/0015/5806/155806v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0019/5488/195488v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[250,161],"assets/images/resized/0019/5488/195488v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[450,291],"assets/images/resized/0019/5488/195488v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20110920-taxi-apps-get-into-gear","title":"BBC - Taxi apps get into gear"},{"external_url":"http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/09/mytaxi-tracks-taxis-on-your-smartphone/","title":"lifehaker: myTaxi Tracks Taxis On Your Smartphone"},{"external_url":"http://www.tabletnews.com.au/mytaxi-catch-a-taxi-with-one-touch/000837","title":"Tablet news: myTaxi â€“ catch a taxi with one touch"},{"external_url":"http://mobile.pcauthority.com.au/Article.aspx?CIID=268826&type=News","title":"Mobile PC Authority: Lost and need a taxi?
