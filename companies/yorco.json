But responsibilities still arenâ€™t meant to be shouldered alone. The problem is that itâ€™s frustrating trying to communicate what needs to be done and even harder trying to keep track of whoâ€™s responsible for what. Simply put, itâ€™s time for something better than email and more productive than twitter.</p>\n\n<p>If your task management app isnâ€™t addictive, itâ€™s probably useless. You need an app that keeps you connected and engaged. Current productivity apps are boring, lack social connection and create extra burden because of unnecessary features. Itâ€™s about time someone integrates social with simple and productive. We&#8217;ve cooked up an elegant solution for you to get more done together.</p>\n\n<p>The Solution.\nYorco Task - A simple, intuitive and fun Web App for people who do things together.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/6032/126032v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0012/6032/126032v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0012/6032/126032v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Bailey","last_name":"Busch","permalink":"bailey-busch","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Croy","last_name":"Bosch","permalink":"croy-bosch","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Robb","last_name":"Schiller","permalink":"robb-schiller","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/3701/123701v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/3701/123701v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0012/3701/123701v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jared","last_name":"Schneider","permalink":"jared-schneider","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Friedman","permalink":"james-friedman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/1873/151873v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[170,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/1873/151873v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[306,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/1873/151873v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
