The Hertzâ€™s are well-known in the region as serial entrepreneurs and have a long track record of building companies that develop transactional applications for e-commerce and financial networks. Though having entered the IP telephony industry late, the company has expanded largely by finding a niche in powering independent VoIP-based Telcos and developing low-cost advanced communication solutions that serve Carrier, Small and Medium Business, and Consumer clients globally.  </p>\n\n<p>The value of TelCentris is in a proprietary Unified Communications Engine that differentiates the company from both Internet and VoIP Service Providers.  This Service Delivery Platform offers telecommunications service providers (including CLECs, ILECs, MSOs, ITSPs, Wireless Operators, ISPs, VARs and others) a flexible, turnkey, carrier-class solution, through which they can successfully offer a myriad of communications services to customers in minimal time and with minimal  upfront capital expenditure. </p>\n\n<p>The same platform is used by the company to provide Hosted IP-PBX and SIP trunking services to Small and Medium business customers at rates far below those offered by legacy telecom services providers. </p>\n\n<p>Though the company does not directly market its consumer telephony offering, TelCentris offers an online-based consumer plan where users can either use a soft phone and make calls through their PC, or sign up for broadband phone and internet service and receive an Analog Telephony Adapter (ATA) that enables the consumer to plug a standard analog phone into their broadband internet connection and make calls independent of the PC.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/1311/21311v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[135,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/1311/21311v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[135,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/1311/21311v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Faught","permalink":"michael-faught","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Bryan","last_name":"Hertz","permalink":"bryan-hertz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"J","last_name":"D Vaughn","permalink":"j-d-vaughn","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Hertz","permalink":"kevin-hertz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Information Officer","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Hertz","permalink":"robert-hertz","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Vonage","permalink":"vonage","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/3024/23024v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3024/23024v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3024/23024v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"CBeyond","permalink":"cbeyond","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/2935/22935v1-max-150x150.png"],[[183,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/2935/22935v1-max-250x250.png"],[[183,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/2935/22935v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"10180 Telesis Court,","address2":"Suite 150","zip_code":"92121","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":32.902266,"longitude":-117.20834}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
