SEER by Galorath was initially envisioned by a veteran project engineer and a team of senior scientists and analysts who experienced first hand the shortcomings of manual estimation processes: Information gaps, inconsistent processes, changing requirements, competing demands, and outside pressure borne of wishful thinking. Galorath has invested over two decades of research and development helping organizations better plan and control project costs, quality, duration and risk. Leveraging sophisticated modeling technology and project-applicable knowledge bases, SEER solutions are proven to accurately replicate real-world project outcomes more quickly and with much greater accuracy than any traditional estimating methodologies.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Galorath provides the most comprehensive, intuitive tools in the industry, with a broad portfolio of solutions organized into in the following solution families:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SEER for Software</li>\n<li>SEER for IT</li>\n<li>SEER for Hardware, Electronics, and Systems</li>\n<li>SEER for Manufacturing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Galorath breakthrough is based on the twin ideals of enhanced functionality and ease-of-use. Every release is designed, not only to surpass our competitive offerings, but to do so while remaining fully accessible to novice users. The company culture reflects the company mission: Continuing innovation built on a foundation of sound scientific principles. The founding members of Galorath Incorporated are still with the company, continuously supplemented by new generations of talent that bring fresh and innovative perspectives within the integrated disciplines of project estimation, analysis, planning, and control. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0011/2519/112519v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,72],"assets/images/resized/0011/2519/112519v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,72],"assets/images/resized/0011/2519/112519v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO ","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Galorath","permalink":"dan-galorath","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"SEO & Internet Marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Big Oak SEO","permalink":"big-oak-studios","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/2517/112517v2-max-150x150.png"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/2517/112517v2-max-250x250.png"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/2517/112517v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"100 N.
