Providing metro and regional aggregation and transport of packet, TDM and optical services with superior service level agreement (SLA) support, Cyanâ€™s solutions provide the industryâ€™s first and only 3-dimensional multi-layer planning, operations and verification systems to scale, extend and simplify networks for more profitable service offerings. </p>\n\n<p>Recognized as the industryâ€™s first purpose-built packet-optical transport system, Cyanâ€™s solutions modularly support Carrier Ethernet services (MEF) with connection oriented Ethernet transport, SONET/SDH, OTN, DWDM and ROADM functions in a highly cost-effective and scalable manner from the access edge to the network core.  The ability to support 10G services today, while laying a foundation for future 100G services has enabled Cyanâ€™s customers to deploy field-proven solutions for key applications such as Carrier Ethernet, wireless backhaul, broadband backhaul (middle-mile), data center connectivity and interconnect, and wholesale services transport for metro, state-wide, regional, national, multi-national and Enterprise networks across North America and Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in Petaluma, California in 2006, Cyan is lead by a team of industry veterans with a track record of successful innovation in communications transport and access networks around the world.
