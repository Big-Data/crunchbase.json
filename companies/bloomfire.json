It helps you capture, display, save, and share information, connecting people who have knowledge with those who need it. Traditional information portals are built on top-down, one-way communication not taking into account the value of peer contribution. Bloomfire uncovers this tribal knowledge that was previously buried in email and hallway conversations, helping your team perform better. Create new videos and posts. Search and browse enduring content. Ask and answer important questions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0014/1297/141297v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,103],"assets/images/resized/0014/1297/141297v2-max-250x250.png"],[[351,145],"assets/images/resized/0014/1297/141297v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Little","permalink":"josh-little","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"McCann","permalink":"david-mccann","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Ambassador","person":{"first_name":"Nemo","last_name":"Chu","permalink":"nemo-chu","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/03/bloomfire-raises-10m-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Bloomfire Raises $10M in Series A Funding","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":26,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Austin Ventures","permalink":"austin-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/0806/10806v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/0806/10806v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/0806/10806v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Redpoint Ventures","permalink":"redpoint-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/5077/15077v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/5077/15077v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/5077/15077v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1717 West 6th Street ","address2":"","zip_code":"78703","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Bloomfire offers free tool for LinkedIn Groups","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":7,"source_url":"https://blog.bloomfire.com/posts/499800-bloomfire-for-linkedin-groups-the-time-has-come","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Bloomfire","permalink":"bloomfire"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0008/6736/86736v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0008/6736/86736v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,335],"assets/images/resized/0008/6736/86736v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[94,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6737/86737v2-max-150x150.png"],[[158,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/6737/86737v2-max-250x250.png"],[[284,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/6737/86737v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0008/6738/86738v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,183],"assets/images/resized/0008/6738/86738v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,330],"assets/images/resized/0008/6738/86738v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,109],"assets/images/resized/0008/6739/86739v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,182],"assets/images/resized/0008/6739/86739v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,328],"assets/images/resized/0008/6739/86739v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/5375/195375v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/5375/195375v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/5375/195375v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/5377/195377v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/5377/195377v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/5377/195377v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/5378/195378v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/5378/195378v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/5378/195378v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/5379/195379v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/5379/195379v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/5379/195379v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/bloomfire-com-having-employees-teach-one-another","title":"Killer Startups"}]}
