The company develops unique content that is culturally relevant for US Latinos, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population.  The content developed and managed by the company lets users search in Spanish or English at YaSabe.com, Google, and Bing and on other partner websites like Univision.com, and PaginasAmarillias.com where Hispanics go online. </p>\n\n<p>YaSabe helps local businesses connect with Hispanic consumers that search for products and services online.  U.S. Hispanics are the fastest growing group of Internet users with 30 million connected Latinos that use the Internet every day.  And Hispanics in the U.S use their mobile phones to access the Internet far more than non-Hispanics.  At the end of 2011, Google disclosed that nearly 10% of all searches emanating from the U.S. are in Spanish and that queries for culturally Hispanic terms are on the rise.  The fundamental problem is that there is a lack of quality content to provide adequate results for these searches.  Whether it’s finding a Spanish speaking dentist, doctor, or lawyer, or finding Hispanic food and groceries, or Latin clothing – the content is woefully inadequate or often simply not available online in English or in Spanish.</p>\n\n<p>The 50 million Hispanics living in the United States exhibit the characteristics of an emerging market in terms of population growth and worth, spending more than $1 trillion in 2011.  In the next 10 years, Latinos will contribute 80% of the growth in the U.S. economy and every major brand and millions of local businesses will rely on these consumers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0020/6126/206126v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0020/6126/206126v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0020/6126/206126v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Zubair","last_name":"Talib","permalink":"zubair-talib","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP-Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Azim","last_name":"Tejani","permalink":"azim-tejani","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Technology","person":{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"Fernandez","permalink":"fernando-fernandez","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/09/yasabe-raises-funding-inc-herndon-va-based-online-search-engine-designed-latinos-find-discover-businesses-jobs-information-locally-raised-undisclosed-amount-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Fee","source_description":"YaSabe Raises Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":4,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"CIT GAP Funds","permalink":"cit-gap-funds-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/8818/28818v2-max-150x150.png"],[[218,110],"assets/images/resized/0002/8818/28818v2-max-250x250.png"],[[218,110],"assets/images/resized/0002/8818/28818v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Washington DC","address1":"13755 Sunrise Valley Drive","address2":"Suite 230","zip_code":"20171","city":"Herndon","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://busquedalocal.univision.com/en/","title":"Univision Partnership"}]}
