Attensity&#8217;s text analytics software applications extract facts, relationships and sentiment from unstructured data, which comprise approximately 85% of the information companies store electronically.</p>\n\n<p>The software uses natural language processing technology to address collective intelligence in blogs, online forums and social media such as Twitter and Facebook; the voice of the customer in surveys and emails; Customer Experience Management (CEM); e-services; research and e-discovery; risk and compliance; and intelligence analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Corporations that use or have used Attensity software include Airbus, Charles Schwab, Citigroup, HP, JetBlue, Lloyds Banking Group, Safeway, Siemens, StubHub, TiVo, Travelocity, Unilever, Walgreens, Wells Fargo and Whirlpool. Government organizations that use or have have used Attensity solutions include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the 2012 election campaign, Attensity partnered with Yahoo! to provide social analytics around the televised GOP debates. Attensity also provided research on customer sentiment on campaign issues to media outlets such as USA Today.</p>\n\n<p>Attensity was founded in 2000. An early investor in Attensity was In-Q-Tel, which funds technology to support the missions of the Central Intelligence Agency and the broader U.S. intelligence community (in the U.S., Attensity sells to the U.S. government through reseller inTTENSITY). In 2009, Palo Alto&#8217;s Attensity Corp. merged with Germany&#8217;s Empolis and Living-e AG to form Attensity Group. In 2010, Attensity Group acquired Biz360, Inc., a provider of social media monitoring and market intelligence solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Attensity Group is a closely held private company. Its majority shareholder is aeris CAPITAL, a private Swiss investment office advising a high net-worth individual and his charitable foundation. Foundation Capital, Granite Ventures, and Scale Venture Partners were among Biz360&#8217;s investors and thus became shareholders in Attensity Group.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/0604/50604v1-max-150x150.png"],[[161,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/0604/50604v1-max-250x250.png"],[[161,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/0604/50604v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Attensity Analyze","permalink":"attensity-analyze","image":null},{"name":"Attensity Respond","permalink":"attensity-respond","image":null},{"name":"Attensity Voice of the Customer Command Center","permalink":"attensity360","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Bean, PhD","permalink":"david-bean-phd","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Attensity Group","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Bonner","permalink":"ian-bonner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO, Attensity Group","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Hersey","permalink":"ian-hersey","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Marketing, Americas","person":{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"H. van Zuylen","permalink":"catherine-h-van-zuylen","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Michelle","last_name":"de Haaff","permalink":"michelle-de-haaff","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director, The Americas","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"D.
