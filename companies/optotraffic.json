Thirty units operate in more than 12 localities in the State of Maryland. </p>\n\n<p>Optotraffic uses in-house developed and patented space laser technology â€“ LIDAR, an application of our company&#8217;s pioneering expertise in the space industry â€“ that provides highly-accurate, low cost traffic monitoring and enforcement solutions. The company delivers the most sophisticated, accurate, secure automated speed enforcement systems. </p>\n\n<p>Our corporate parent provides technological hardware and software solutions and associated science and engineering services for Federal Government agencies, producing pioneering instrumentation in laser ranging, attitude determination, spectroscopy, and radiometry for remote sensing.  Its exemplary performance is demonstrated by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Contractor of the Year Award in 2007. </p>\n\n<p>The Optotraffic units are calibrated daily and tested to within one mile per hour - - in annual tests by independent laboratories and periodically by the police departments of local municipalities.  Optotrafficâ€™s automated speed enforcement system measures the speeds of passing vehicles with an accuracy of +/- 1 mph. Less than 0.2% of all issued Optotraffic citations have been contested in a court hearing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0013/8640/138640v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0013/8640/138640v2-max-250x250.png"],[[309,106],"assets/images/resized/0013/8640/138640v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0014/1163/141163v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,158],"assets/images/resized/0014/1163/141163v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,285],"assets/images/resized/0014/1163/141163v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.upvery.com/108639-space-laser-technology-makes-for-more-effective-traffic-law-enforcement.html","title":""}]}
