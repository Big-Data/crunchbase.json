So a young woman can actually hold a dress up in front of herself, just like she would at the rack in a store, and immediately validate if an item’s style/color is right for her. No downloads, no plug-ins, no paper markers… it just works. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0005/0407/50407v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0407/50407v1-max-250x250.png"],[[312,188],"assets/images/resized/0005/0407/50407v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"The Webcam Social Shopper","permalink":"the-webcam-social-shopper","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Szymczyk","permalink":"matt-szymczyk","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Goldberg","permalink":"alex-goldberg","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of UI/UX","person":{"first_name":"Hans","last_name":"Forsman","permalink":"hans-forsman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Product & Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Benoff","permalink":"jack-benoff","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"90066","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"420\" height=\"236.25\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ocVEvK9Sl34?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ocVEvK9Sl34?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"420\" height=\"236.25\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>A quick video tutorial for online shoppers that are using our Webcam Social Shopper for the first time.</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/6262/166262v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0016/6262/166262v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,369],"assets/images/resized/0016/6262/166262v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/6263/166263v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0016/6263/166263v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,369],"assets/images/resized/0016/6263/166263v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/6264/166264v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0016/6264/166264v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,369],"assets/images/resized/0016/6264/166264v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/6265/166265v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0016/6265/166265v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,369],"assets/images/resized/0016/6265/166265v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/fashion/fashion-embraces-augmented-reality-technology.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1323799297-8KHtYq+KzSx2SpiDni3wIA","title":"FASHION Brands Embrace an 'Augmented Reality'"},{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/05/zugara-ecommerce-banana-flam/","title":"Zugara licenses Webcam Social Shopper to Banana Flame"},{"external_url":"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/another-blow-to-retailers-virtual-dressing-rooms-20110809-1ijxa.html","title":"Another blow to retailers: virtual dressing rooms"},{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/augmented_reality_video_conferencing.php","title":"Augmented Reality Coming to Video Conferencing"}]}
