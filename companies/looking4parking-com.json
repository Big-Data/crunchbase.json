The groupâ€™s first office was based in Daveâ€™s house in Kippax, Leeds, but the rapid expansion of the business meant that a move was necessary, seeing the ever-growing team move to offices in Barnsley before finally moving back to a new Leeds city centre office, which they currently share with notable design and events giants Logistik.</p>\n\n<p>Martin said the trio started the business because:</p>\n\n<p>â€œWe felt the online airport parking market was confusing, cluttered and difficult to shop in and so we saw the opportunity for a simple website and booking engine that was guaranteed to find the best deals and lowest prices&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The company vision is simple, yet effective - â€œTo be the first airport parking brand which springs to mind. To be innovators in terms of web and mobile technologyâ€ - and this vision has been the driving force behind the looking4parking.com ethos.</p>\n\n<p>July 2011 will see the launch of a new, innovative website boasting a slick design, enhanced features and an improved customer experience. The month will also see Looking4Parking moving into the mobile app market as they prepare to launch their collaboration with iPhone App developers Pink Gorilla, offering information, bookings and discounts directly to the shoppersâ€™ hands.</p>\n\n<p>Business Development Executive George Wall believes the key to Looking4Parkingâ€™s success is due to the companies willingness to adapt to new technologies.</p>\n\n<p>â€œThe world is changing, people donâ€™t communicate via the traditional methods any more. New media such as Twitter, mobile apps, Facebook and viral marketing are a far more effective way to engage your audience, and I believe the reason weâ€™re doing so well is because we acknowledge that.â€</p>\n\n<p>Company director Martin Mansell also realises that the internet is a crucial part of the business.</p>\n\n<p>â€œOur websites tick all the boxes in terms of usability and optimisation, giving our customers a first class experience from search to booking and beyond. Our knowledge of SEO has also been instrumental â€“ enabling us to maximise our online exposure while keeping our advertising budget under control.â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0014/3466/143466v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0014/3466/143466v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[432,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/3466/143466v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Internet Marketing Executive","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Whyte","permalink":"aaron-whyte","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development Executive","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Wall","permalink":"george-wall","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Leeds Office","address1":"Looking4Parking","address2":"31 Burley Road","zip_code":"LS3 1JT","city":"Leeds","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
