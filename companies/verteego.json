On top of this, European manufacturing and distribution companies have to make their suppliers accountable and become compliant themselves with REACH, a regulation on hazardous chemicals incorporated into products.\nTo put it bluntly, environmental management is coming on top of financial and HR management, to enable companies take into account all 3 dimensions (financial performance, social performance, environmental performance): this is where Verteego comes in.\nFor the greatest companies to tackle the environmental management problem as an oppportunity, Verteego has developed cutting edge web platforms dealing with both carbon and energy management and REACH compliance, two environmental must-have applications of the 2010 - 2020 decade.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/5433/25433v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/5433/25433v2-max-250x250.png"],[[330,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/5433/25433v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"My
