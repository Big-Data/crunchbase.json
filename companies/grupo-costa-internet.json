An innovative new websiteâ€”Eventz4Kids.comâ€”researches and culls together thousands of events for kids and families throughout the United States.   </p>\n\n<p>The website is easy to use. All you do is pick a city and a calendar will appear showing you a list of events and activities occurring near you. Postings include everything from afterschool and weekend activities to yoga and camps, as well as classes for mothers-to-be and other family activities.</p>\n\n<p>â€œEventz4Kids.com was created for busy parents who quickly and easily want to find events and activities for their children,â€ said Rachel Cohen, the siteâ€™s cofounder.  â€œAs a mother of four, I know how hard it can be to locate suitable kidsâ€™ events and activities throughout the week.â€</p>\n\n<p>Busy parents can now quickly see events in their area and can bookmark subjects that interest them, such as theater, sports, outdoor activities, and many others.  Users can also receive a weekly emailed update of the events going on near them for that week, so even if they don&#8217;t have time to log on to the website, theyâ€™ll receive the information they need. In addition, users can pass on kidsâ€™ events and activities to interested friends via email or social networks.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0013/5608/135608v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0013/5608/135608v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,141],"assets/images/resized/0013/5608/135608v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/5606/135606v2-max-150x150.png"],[[244,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/5606/135606v2-max-250x250.png"],[[439,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/5606/135606v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0013/5607/135607v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0013/5607/135607v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0013/5607/135607v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://slapstart.com/2011/03/eventz4kids/","title":"Eventz4kids: Find Fun Kidsâ€™ Activities in Your Area"}]}
