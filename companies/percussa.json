Multiple objects and their spatial relationships are used to control software instead of a single pointer device like the computer mouse.</p>\n\n<p>Percussa&#8217;s first product, AudioCubes, allows people to easily make music and perform live using smart wireless blocks. Bert Schiettecatte started to develop AudioCubes before founding Percussa in 2004. The AudioCubes were launched in 2007, and are sold online through Percussa&#8217;s website.</p>\n\n<p>Percussa is expanding its product line from the professional musicians to consumers, while keep working on the development of its core technology for enabling tangible interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>More information about Percussa and the AudioCubes can be found at http://www.percussa.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/3064/43064v6-max-150x150.png"],[[154,49],"assets/images/resized/0004/3064/43064v6-max-250x250.png"],[[154,49],"assets/images/resized/0004/3064/43064v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"AudioCubes","permalink":"audiocubes","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bert","last_name":"Schiettecatte","permalink":"bert-schiettecatte","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"9420","city":"Mere","state_code":null,"country_code":"BEL","latitude":50.9228106,"longitude":3.9712962}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4NDt5WjxBH8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>AudioCubes</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0013/5751/135751v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,138],"assets/images/resized/0013/5751/135751v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,249],"assets/images/resized/0013/5751/135751v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
