Fanzy gamifies the experience of being a fan by rewarding fans for their social activity around brands, TV shows, films, celebrities, sports teams, athletes and more.  As Fanzy members generate buzz for brands, they unlock real life rewards, social achievements and are ranked for each Fanzy they join based on Fanzy&#8217;s proprietary FanScore.</p>\n\n<p>Fanzy can be added to a tab on a Facebook Page in 3 clicks on a fully self service basis.  </p>\n\n<p>Once installed, brands upload images, define keywords and videos that they want their fans to share and customize calls to action. Keywords can include marketing messages and links to videos, photos or websites.   Marketers then have access to a robust rewards builder that enables them to target rewards to influential fans across the Fanzy network based on specific social loyalty achievements (such as sharing a video and getting 10 likes) or based on their level of influence.  </p>\n\n<p>Fanzy is free to use and offers premium services on a subscription basis.</p>\n\n<p>Over 20,000 Facebook Pages are using Fanzy, including MTV shows like Pimp my Ride and Awkward, musicians including Nicki Minaj, LMFAO and Janis Joplin, sports teams the Detroit Pistons and Sacramento Kings, movies including Drive and brands including Smirnoff&#8217;s, Spotify, Living Social, Hotels.com, APB Reloaded, TF1 and the NRJ Awards.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0014/6187/146187v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,108],"assets/images/resized/0014/6187/146187v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,195],"assets/images/resized/0014/6187/146187v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder
