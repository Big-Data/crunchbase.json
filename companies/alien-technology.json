Its claim to fame is â€œfluidic self-assembly,â€ a futuristic manufacturing method developed by UC Berkeleyâ€™s John S. Smith, who founded Alien in 1994.</p>\n\n<p>Alienâ€™s factories in Fargo, N.D, and San Jose have machines that take the tiny RFID chips and put them into a river of goo. The goo has chemicals that make the chips align themselves into little packages where they can be sealed and attached to a radio antenna. (If you donâ€™t like my technical description of goo, thereâ€™s more information here. Basically, the chips flow through a river until they settle into little receptor slots on a piece of film. Then theyâ€™re sealed and tethered to an antenna).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,121],"assets/images/resized/0003/1901/31901v1-max-150x150.png"],[[130,121],"assets/images/resized/0003/1901/31901v1-max-250x250.png"],[[130,121],"assets/images/resized/0003/1901/31901v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$197M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"f","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/10/06/alien-technology-raises-38-million-for-rfid-technology/","source_description":"VentureBeat","raised_amount":38000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Advanced
