Thus their goals become projects on Amazee and these projects come to life.</p>\n\n<p>Each project on Amazee has its online publication medium: the project magazine. Via an intuitive interface users can add a large variety of so called widgets to these magazines. Among many other things there are gallery, blog and event planning widgets which can be combined into a very attractive package.</p>\n\n<p>Amazee provides interfaces for the most important online platforms. Projects can be embedded in other places and therefore spread virally â€“ for example on the Iphone or on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>The collaboration of members in projects on Amazee is empowered by different state-of-the-art tools such as calendars, discussion boards, polls and chats, event planning modules etc.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Amazee is distinguished by its very responsible user community which is more attracted by the collective pursuit of social challenges than by self expression and non-binding chit-chat.</p>\n\n<p>The networking of users on Amazee happens via projects and common goals. An activity stream informs all members about the latest activites and supports a lively exchange among these members.</p>\n\n<p>Amazee is based on the open source framework Drupal and is holistically aimed at the use of free, open source technologies. From this follows that not only single projects but the whole platform benefits from the wisdom of the many.</p>\n\n<p>The platform has been launched in September 2008 and is growing in popularity especially in the US, Germany and Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p>Amazee AG â€“ the company behind Amazee â€“ is  privately financed  and is being supported by the Swiss governmentâ€™s innovation promotion agency CTI as well as by Technopark Zurich. Founded in 2007 by Gregory Gerhardt, Dania Gerhardt and Prodosh Banerjee, it is headquartered in Zurich and currently employs a staff of 6.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0002/1947/21947v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/1947/21947v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/1947/21947v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Gregory","last_name":"Gerhardt","permalink":"gregory-gerhardt","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/7855/47855v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,247],"assets/images/resized/0004/7855/47855v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,297],"assets/images/resized/0004/7855/47855v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Gregory Gerhardt / <a href=\"http://www.amazee.com\" title=\"Amazee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazee</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Deputy CTO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Schmid","permalink":"michael-schmid","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO, CFO","person":{"first_name":"Dania","last_name":"Gerhardt","permalink":"dania-gerhardt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Editor, Community Manager","person":{"first_name":"Mathias","last_name":"Moeller","permalink":"mathias-moeller","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Junior Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"UnternÃ¤hrer","permalink":"marco-unternhrer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Junior Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Truninger","permalink":"daniel-truninger","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO, Head Editor","person":{"first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Bally","permalink":"lucas-bally","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5723/35723v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[118,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/5723/35723v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[118,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/5723/35723v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Lucas Bally / <a href=\"http://www.amazee.com\" title=\"Amazee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazee</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Head Technology, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Markus","last_name":"Tressl","permalink":"markus-tressl","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/2726/72726v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,185],"assets/images/resized/0007/2726/72726v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,185],"assets/images/resized/0007/2726/72726v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>CC / <a href=\"http://www.amazee.com/\" title=\"Amazee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazee</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"Technoparkstr. 1","address2":"Newton 2012","zip_code":"8005","city":"Zurich","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHE","latitude":47.389909,"longitude":8.516049},{"description":"San Francisco Office","address1":"c/o Swissnex","address2":"730 Montgomery Street","zip_code":"94111","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"375\" height=\"211.5\">\t<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" />\t<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\t<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1142475&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=FF7700&amp;fullscreen=1\" />\t<embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1142475&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=FF7700&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"375\" height=\"211.5\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/1142475?pg=embed&amp;sec=1142475\">Project Pete</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user363872?pg=embed&amp;sec=1142475\">Amazee</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&amp;sec=1142475\">Vimeo</a>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0004/0694/40694v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,170],"assets/images/resized/0004/0694/40694v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,306],"assets/images/resized/0004/0694/40694v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0008/2380/82380v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0008/2380/82380v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,351],"assets/images/resized/0008/2380/82380v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/2383/82383v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/2383/82383v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0008/2383/82383v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
