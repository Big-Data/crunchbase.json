AdRocketâ€™s network increases publisher eCPMs through intelligent ad selection and optimization.  Every month, many billions of email newsletters are sent to subscribers, yet the advertising is poorly targeted and largely ineffective.  AdRocket fixes this by providing publisher&#8217;s with individually-relevant ads for email communications, websites or RSS.   Unlike &#8216;cookies&#8217; which have a very short life, our email approach creates much longer lasting, richer individual profiles without using personally-identifiable data.  Our model is to share in the ad revenue.</p>\n\n<p>AdRocket is not an email marketer or sender.  Rather the company inserts relevant cost-per-click text ads into publishers&#8217; opt-in email communications.  Over 30% of email users have images turned off, meaning many publishers&#8217; ads are never seen.  AdRocket also solves this problem as text ads are automatically displayed in every email opened.</p>\n\n<p>AdRocket is backed by top-tier seed investors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/4249/24249v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/4249/24249v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/4249/24249v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Milener","permalink":"scott-milener-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4206/24206v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4206/24206v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[205,273],"assets/images/resized/0002/4206/24206v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.sieglephoto.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Architect","person":{"first_name":"Tao","last_name":"Ge","permalink":"tao-ge","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Liye","last_name":"Zhang","permalink":"liye-zhang","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Howard Rice Nemerovski Canady Falk & Rabkin","permalink":"howard-rice-nemerovski-canady-falk-rabkin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/6896/16896v1-max-150x150.png"],[[192,111],"assets/images/resized/0001/6896/16896v1-max-250x250.png"],[[192,111],"assets/images/resized/0001/6896/16896v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2009/06/01/javelin-launches-with-70m-fund-for-early-stage-startups/","source_description":"VentureBeat","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"European Founders Fund","permalink":"european-founders-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0001/7431/17431v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/7431/17431v3-max-250x250.png"],[[402,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/7431/17431v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Auren","last_name":"Hoffman","permalink":"auren-hoffman-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,139],"assets/images/resized/0004/3984/43984v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,232],"assets/images/resized/0004/3984/43984v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,232],"assets/images/resized/0004/3984/43984v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"McKenna","permalink":"patrick-mckenna-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Oliver","last_name":"Jung","permalink":"oliver-jung-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Lukasz","last_name":"Gadowski","permalink":"lukasz-gadowski","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5235/35235v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5235/35235v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,373],"assets/images/resized/0003/5235/35235v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.dld-conference.com</p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Javelin Venture Partners","permalink":"javelin-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/9129/59129v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0005/9129/59129v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[401,140],"assets/images/resized/0005/9129/59129v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"AdRocket Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.775196,"longitude":-122.419204}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object id=\"otv_o_654103\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\"  classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param value=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/698501\" name=\"movie\" /><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\" /><param value=\"always\" name=\"allowScriptAccess\" /><param value=\"transparent\" name=\"wmode\" /><param value=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" name=\"flashvars\" /><embed name=\"otv_e_652829\" id=\"otv_e_710275\" flashvars=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/698501\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /></object>","description":"<p>TC50</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.adrocket.com","title":"AdRocket"}]}
