The values of virtualization including flexibility, scalability and mobility complicate business continuity efforts in times of disaster. To realize the benefits of virtualization, organizations need to optimize IT processes for virtual environments. Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery is difficult - because to date there have been no virtual-ready replication methods that scale for large data centers. Traditional physical replication tools are complex &amp; manual, while virtual replication tools are not built for scale and reliability. With hypervisor-based replication, all that changes. Zerto is storage agnostic, simple to install, intuitive to use, &amp; is suited for both data centers and cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Founded by a team of storage industry veterans, Zerto provides large enterprises with business continuity and disaster recovery solutions designed specifically for virtualized infrastructure and the cloud. Zerto Virtual Replication is the industry’s first hypervisor-based replication solution for tier-one applications, replacing traditional array-based BC/DR solutions that were not built to deal with the virtual paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>Ziv Kedem, Zerto’s co-founder and CEO, previously co-founded Kashya, acquired by EMC. Backed by USVP, Battery Ventures and Greylock Partners, Zerto is dual-headquartered in Israel and the United States.</p>\n\n<p>More info can be found at http://www.zerto.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0009/4789/94789v6-max-150x150.png"],[[200,118],"assets/images/resized/0009/4789/94789v6-max-250x250.png"],[[200,118],"assets/images/resized/0009/4789/94789v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Jacques","last_name":"Benkoski","permalink":"jacques-benkoski","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$21.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":25,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Greylock Partners","permalink":"greylock","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":31,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Greylock Partners","permalink":"greylock","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/zerto-completes-15m-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Zerto Completes $15M Series B Funding","raised_amount":15000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"U.S. Venture Partners","permalink":"u-s-venture-partners-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-150x150.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-250x250.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Greylock Partners","permalink":"greylock","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/4363/4363v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"US Office","address1":"930 Winter Street","address2":"Suite 2500","zip_code":"02451","city":"Waltham","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/94riXBp0ODw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>What is Zerto?</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0015/3057/153057v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0015/3057/153057v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0015/3057/153057v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0018/2201/182201v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0018/2201/182201v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[415,274],"assets/images/resized/0018/2201/182201v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
