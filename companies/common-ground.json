The platform acts as a virtual community bulletin board, allowing members to post things they want to do and find like-minded locals to do them with. </p>\n\n<p>Common Ground was founded on the belief that the virtual world should support the real world, not the other way around. The company&#8217;s vision is to build physical community by facilitating in-person connections in neighborhoods around the world. </p>\n\n<p>Common Ground beta is live in New York City at www.GetCommonGround.com </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/1265/131265v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/1265/131265v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/1265/131265v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
