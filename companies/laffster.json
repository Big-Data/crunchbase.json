Powering both its own web and mobile apps as well as discovery on third-party platforms, Laffster&#8217;s technology was built in conjunction with a wide variety of researchers and scholars in humor, including neuroscientists and psychologists at schools like Dartmouth College and the University of Colorado, as well as the Cartoon Editor at The New Yorker, Bob Mankoff. </p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Venice, CA, Laffster is a graduate of MuckerLab. Seed investors include Greylock Partners (Facebook, Linkedin, etc.), Adam Nash (LinkedIn), Chris Williams (Maker Studios) and Howard Lindzon (StockTwits) as well as talent agencies and management companies like Paradigm (Neil Patrick Harris, Sharon Stone, etc.) and Parallel (Jeff Foxworthy, Lisa
