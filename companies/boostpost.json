There are 50+ services available, and webmasters can choose which services to include for their readers. The presentation of the social network buttons is uniform, and the emphasis here is ease of use. </p>\n\n<p>The site takes the concept of bookmarking and keys in on a specific niche: social networks. Services such as &#8220;AddThis&#8221;, &#8220;AddToAny&#8221;, or &#8220;ShareThis&#8221; offer a 1 stop shopping approach to all services, whereas Boostpost is focused only on sites similar to Digg. This caters to a more specific need for both the webmaster and the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Readers may also add a bookmarklet which allows them to take any URL and find out how it ranks among the 50+ services in Boostpost. This &#8220;at a glance&#8221; access means avid readers can actively promote the posts they favor via one central control panel, or &#8220;boostpage&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Webmasters can also take advantage of revenue sharing via their Adsense Client ID. When adding the Boostpost button or widget to their site, if readers click on the &#8220;Boost&#8221; icon, they will be taken to the site&#8217;s &#8220;boostpage&#8221;. Advertising shown on this page will produce revenue shared between the originating site and Boostpost.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0006/6161/66161v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/6161/66161v2-max-250x250.png"],[[265,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/6161/66161v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ShareThis","permalink":"sharethis","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/5706/15706v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/5706/15706v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/5706/15706v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"AddToAny","permalink":"add-to-any","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/1589/11589v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/1589/11589v3-max-250x250.png"],[[300,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/1589/11589v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
