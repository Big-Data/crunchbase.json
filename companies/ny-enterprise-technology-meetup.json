The group has over 1,250 members and hosts monthly meetups featuring 4 enterprise technology companies which draw 150 attendees each.</p>\n\n<p>You can join the group at www.meetup.com/ny-enterprise-tech.</p>\n\n<p>The Meetup was launched as a way to help the enterprise technology ecosystem in NY leverage the great foundation set by its consumer counterpart.  Consumer technology has a strong community including incubators, meetups such as the NYTM, and many networking opportunities, and the NYETM aims to become a first class enterprise cohort.</p>\n\n<p>The group&#8217;s mission statement is to foster innovation in the NY enterprise technology ecosystem through promoting early stage technology companies, supporting entrepreneurs, educating companies on how to work with enterprises, and creating an environment where entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses can all network and learn from one another.  What better place to launch than NYC, where we are full of enterprises such as financial services, advertising, media, retail, and fashion companies.</p>\n\n<p>The first NYETM event featured demos from Bitly, PerspecSys, Socialware, and Red Rover, and the event reached standing room only capacity with an audience of 125 people including technologists, investors, entrepreneurs, and students.  The group continues to host monthly events throughout the year.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0020/1861/201861v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,203],"assets/images/resized/0020/1861/201861v2-max-250x250.png"],[[432,352],"assets/images/resized/0020/1861/201861v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/Organizer","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Lehr","permalink":"jonathan-lehr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1805/201805v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0020/1805/201805v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0020/1805/201805v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Founding Sponsor","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cooley LLP ","permalink":"cooley-llp","image":null}},{"title":"Founding Sponsor","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Box","permalink":"box","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/269s_T2WkYc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Enterprise VC Panel - September NY Enterprise Technology Meetup</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PvAi51IyyPk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>August 2012 NY Enterprise Technology Meetup keynote by Jive cofounder Bill Lynch</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2012/04/25/why-the-enterprise-matters-and-deserves-your-attention/","title":"Why the Enterprise Matters and Deserves Your Attention"},{"external_url":"http://birch.co/post/21382251685/brave-new-enterprise-technology-world","title":"Brave New Enterprise Technology World"},{"external_url":"http://birch.co/post/21326371418/the-coming-wave-of-enterprise-tech-in-nyc","title":"The Coming Wave of Enterprise Tech in NYC"},{"external_url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/09/12/vcs-offer-tips-for-enterprise-tech-entrepreneurs/","title":"VCs Offer Tips for Enterprise Tech Entrepreneurs"},{"external_url":"http://pandodaily.com/2012/10/18/namely-raises-lerer-ventures-led-seed-round-to-expand-hr-tools-beyond-ad-agencies/","title":"Mention in PandoDaily"},{"external_url":"http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/21/fifteen-nyc-based-enterprise-startups-to-keep-an-eye-on/","title":"Fifteen NYC-based enterprise startups to keep an eye on"}]}
