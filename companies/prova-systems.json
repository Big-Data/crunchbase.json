The system also decodes vehicle DTCs (diagnostic trouble codes).  These monitors are wireless and use Zigbee/802.15.4 wireless to communicate vehicle data to the management software, Fleet Genius.</p>\n\n<p>The company also makes a vehicle and fleet management application, Fleet Genius, which collects the data created by the VHMs and analyzes that for use by the vehicle owner or fleet manager.  Fleet Genius runs on a standard windows PC.</p>\n\n<p>VHM data can also be sent to 3rd party management applications via an XML based API for intergration into 3rd party platforms.  </p>\n\n<p>Zigbee wireless operations are managed by a family of Access Point basestations that provide support for small and larger drive-by installations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0019/7200/197200v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[233,93],"assets/images/resized/0019/7200/197200v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[233,93],"assets/images/resized/0019/7200/197200v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Fleet Genius PRO","permalink":"fleet-genius-pro","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Yaron","permalink":"john-yaron","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Collins","permalink":"john-collins","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Griffin Technology","permalink":"griffin-technology","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0007/0000/70000v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,102],"assets/images/resized/0007/0000/70000v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,183],"assets/images/resized/0007/0000/70000v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"General Motors Onstar","permalink":"general-motors-onstar","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$85k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://benfranklin.org/news/bftpnep-to-invest-875000-in-regional-economic-development","source_description":"","raised_amount":35000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/01/prova-systems-receives-50k-follow-on-investment-ben-franklin-technology-partners-northeastern-pennsylvania.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"PROVA Systems Receives $50K Follow-on Investment from Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":27,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeast Pennsylvania","permalink":"ben-franklin-technology-partners-of-northeast-pennsylvania","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/2963/22963v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/2963/22963v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[209,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/2963/22963v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"10 Enterprise Dr","address2":"","zip_code":"18407","city":"Carbondale","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
