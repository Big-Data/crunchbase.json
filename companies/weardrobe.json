It is a place where people can catalog their own clothing and easily browse through the â€˜lookbooksâ€™ of other peopleâ€™s street style. Users can upload photos, tag what they are wearing, and organize these items in a virtual closet to share with others. Tags also allow users to search and view all the clothing photos of a particular piece of clothing in their own or their friendsâ€™ wardrobes. All the content on Weardrobe is user-generated, comprising photos and clothing tags. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6711/16711v3-max-150x150.png"],[[243,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6711/16711v3-max-250x250.png"],[[243,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6711/16711v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Weardrobe.com","permalink":"weardrobe-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Suzanne","last_name":"Xie","permalink":"suzanne-xie","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0009/5900/95900v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0009/5900/95900v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0009/5900/95900v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Tong","permalink":"richard-tong","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Polyvore","permalink":"polyvore","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0000/1273/1273v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0000/1273/1273v8-max-250x250.png"],[[274,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1273/1273v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Chictopia","permalink":"chictopia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/8363/18363v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/8363/18363v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/8363/18363v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"lookbook","permalink":"lookbook","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Chicisimo","permalink":"chicisimo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0004/6874/46874v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0004/6874/46874v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0004/6874/46874v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/like-com-acquires-street-style-fashion-community-weardrobe/","source_description":"TechCrunch","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":11,"acquired_day":18,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Like.com","permalink":"like","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/0717/20717v1-max-150x150.png"],[[162,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/0717/20717v1-max-250x250.png"],[[162,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/0717/20717v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"241 Everett Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.446662,"longitude":-122.164925}],"milestones":[{"description":"Like.com acquired by Google","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":20,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/20/its-official-google-acquires-like-com/","source_text":null,"source_description":"It's Official: Google acquires Like.com","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Weardrobe","permalink":"weardrobe"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
