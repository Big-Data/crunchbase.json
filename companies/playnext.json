Customers send their games to Playnext; Playnext sends them the games. Playnext is able to do this because it buys and sells used games.</p>\n\n<p>Playnext uses a &#8220;slot&#8221; system. Customers pay a monthly fee to buy slots. Each slot allows customers to trade games.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent users from trying to game the system(trade a low value game in, receive a high value game, then sell it,) Playnext has a send/trade limit for each game.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0017/7331/177331v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0017/7331/177331v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[399,80],"assets/images/resized/0017/7331/177331v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"GameFly","permalink":"gamefly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/8854/18854v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/8854/18854v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/8854/18854v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Goozex","permalink":"goozex","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0004/1843/41843v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0004/1843/41843v1-max-250x250.png"],[[251,76],"assets/images/resized/0004/1843/41843v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Swap.com","permalink":"swaptree","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/2451/22451v6-max-150x150.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/2451/22451v6-max-250x250.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/2451/22451v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
