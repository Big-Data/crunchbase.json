The Trunity platform is an enterprise class, highly scalable â€œmulti-tenantâ€ platform with the security, administrative controls and reporting required by both education and large organizations. The Trunity platform supports dynamic content types such as video, pictures, blogging and social media integration, as well as dynamic taxonomies for organizing the content, which can be distributed across multiple interrelated sites. Additionally, the Trunity platform supports on-the-fly virtual classroom creation and linking of multiple sites together to form a community or ecosystem of related sites. </p>\n\n<p>Trunityâ€™s content is crowd-sourced from a rapidly growing community of experts in multiple scientific disciplines. Currently, over 1500 PhDâ€™s and scientists from 70 countries contribute expert articles and content that is published on www.trunity.net, which is our crowd sourced community. NASA, The National Academies of Science, the UN, NSF and many other organizations also contribute content to the site. The crowd sourced content is delivered to consumers as living virtual textbooks, virtual classrooms and personalized web sites.</p>\n\n<p>Trunity is transforming textbook publishing.  The traditional model of virtual and dead-wood textbooks where an author writes a textbook, sends this to a publisher, and then proceeds through a long editorial and politically correct focus group process (which typically takes a year or more to complete), is archaic and takes too long with the end product only expected to last 3 years. For dynamic subjects such as environmental science, biology, engineering, medicine, law, and political science, most textbooks are out of date by the time they are published. </p>\n\n<p>Trunityâ€™s crowd sourced publishing model forever disrupts that legacy process. Experts from around the globe participate in a stringent approval process where their credentials are verified and a peer recommendation is required. Once approved, these scientists write and publish articles on the Trunity platform. This content is then selected by teaching professionals to be incorporated into virtual textbooks that are assembled on the fly. Content is always up to date and relevant. Students subscribe to this virtual textbook revenue is then split between Trunity and the content providers.</p>\n\n<p>Trunity Knowledge is our virtual, living textbook solution. Expert content is currently crowd sourced from over 1500 PhDs and 500+ industry experts and is then submitted to the platform in relatively small units incorporating text, pictures, audio and video.  A review and approval workflow with members, authors and editors ensure that content is properly vetted. </p>\n\n<p>The National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) sponsors the Encyclopedia of the Earth on Trunityâ€™s platform and appointed Cutler Cleveland, the Director of Boston Universityâ€™s Center for Energy and Environmental Studies, to serve as the Editor in Chief. In this capacity, Dr. Cleveland assigns experts to specific roles and serves as the final authority on content. Other governmental agencies, subject specific associations or even universities may choose to sponsor the development of other Trunity sites and appoint an Editor in Chief to maintain the integrity of the content. For instance, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the NCSE partnered to establish the CAMEL project (Climate Adaptation Mitigation e-Learning) and built a team of subject matter experts to ensure content quality.  Similarly, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) leveraged more than 50 years of quality data from the Central Intelligence Agency to establish the Medea Community on the Trunity platform.  </p>\n\n<p>Professors and teachers then act as curators, selecting the components most relevant to their classroom to build their own textbook.  With Trunityâ€™s exclusive Live Cross Publishing feature, curators have the option to receive automatic updates to the original content as the author makes changes over time, keeping the virtual textbook updated effortlessly.</p>\n\n<p>By delivering the textbooks electronically, Trunity is able to offer them at minimal cost and with the convenience of a computer or tablet. Through the convenient delivery of high quality, low cost textbooks, Trunity is leading the way in the democratization of global education.</p>\n\n<p>Trunity Learning\nTrunity Learning is our learning management system (LMS) that provides educators with all the tools of an online classroom environment. The online learning environment allows administrators to increase enrollment by eliminating geographic barriers, and by accommodating the lifestyle of working adults.</p>\n\n<p>Teachers engage students through discussion forums, blogs, messaging, and social mediaâ€¦the same forms of communication used in their personal and professional lives every day.  Teachers can issue self-graded exams and quizzes that provide  students with multimedia responses to correct and incorrect answers to reinforce learning, publish key events with the calendar feature, and track student and class performance with robust reporting and analytics.  </p>\n\n<p>Both students and teachers can archive class work and assignments through their own portfolios that follow them from course to course over the years. Trunity Learning is provided as a SaaS solution to reduce the burden on internal IT staff and is sold either as a site licensed solution or to the individual student on a class-by-class basis. </p>\n\n<p>Trunity Connect\nTrunity Connect is to corporations and other organizations what Trunity Knowledge and Trunity Learning are to educational institutions. With Trunity Connect, companies provide a safe and secure environment for their customers and business partners to receive product information, provide feedback, and share best practices with peers. </p>\n\n<p>Companies create loyal customer advocates through improved customer service and the ability to share multimedia, customer driven content. Companies engage their customers with video, articles, news, surveys, calendars and events, discussion forums, email and messaging, blogs and social sharing through Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and more. </p>\n\n<p>Enterprises of all sizes can train business partners and deliver certification exams to ensure quality support. Robust analytics allow them to keep their finger on the pulse of customer activity.  </p>\n\n<p>Companies can also use Trunity Connect as an intranet to share information across internal groups, serving as a corporate knowledge base. The very same functions used for K12 and Higher Education are also available for corporate training, education and development in the business world.</p>\n\n<p>All these improvements are provided at a lower cost with a self-service model on a SaaS technology platform.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Terry","last_name":"Anderton","permalink":"terry-anderton-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Joakim","last_name":"Lindblom","permalink":"joakim-lindblom","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"EVP, Strategy and Business Development","person":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"Horn","permalink":"william-horn","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Blackboard","permalink":"blackboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/2581/22581v1-max-150x150.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/2581/22581v1-max-250x250.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/2581/22581v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Moodlerooms","permalink":"moodlerooms","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/6675/76675v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/6675/76675v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/6675/76675v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mzinga","permalink":"mzinga","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/4271/14271v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/4271/14271v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/4271/14271v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Jive Software","permalink":"jive-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[420,200],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate headquarters","address1":"15 Green Street","address2":"","zip_code":"01950","city":"Newburyport","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.eoearth.org","title":"Encyclopedia of the Earth"}]}
