They recognise the flexible working opportunities aswell as the massive savings to their companies.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, virtual office services such as Dublin Mail Drop provide businesses with a prestigious address in a central Dublin and real people to deal with telephone calls and mail and administration at a fraction of the cost of taking on their own physical office and staff.</p>\n\n<p>Consider that by employing Dublin Mail Drop’s services you could save thousands in office rental and the costs associated with office rental – rates, utilities, staff.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, it was thought the virtual office would appeal only to start-up businesses – small companies keen to project the right image to potential clients, while sole-operating from the back bedroom on a shoestring budget.  At Dublin Mail Drop, the use of virtual office by this sector has grown by 25% per annum in the last three years.</p>\n\n<p>It is true that the services offered by virtual offices – made possible only by tremendous advances in technology over the last decade – are proving to be a godsend to thousands of entrepreneurs and small businesses in Ireland and internationally.</p>\n\n<p>It is not only small and young businesses that are using virtual office services.  Dublin Mail Drop can name a host of major companies who have complemented their existing network of offices with virtual ones – including Qantas Airlines and Canon.</p>\n\n<p>Most commonly, multi-nationals will exploit virtual offices when they&#8217;re looking to expand into a foreign market and want to test the waters before they commit to buying any real estate. Once they’re satisfied the market is good, they look into setting up a physical presence.</p>\n\n<p>As communications technologies improve further and business becomes even more mobile, the growth of virtual offices looks set to continue. To a greater or lesser extent, the virtual office is making sound commercial sense to all sizes of progressive organisation.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing like a fading fad, virtual offices will be in vogue from now on.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/9840/179840v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/9840/179840v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[358,268],"assets/images/resized/0017/9840/179840v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
