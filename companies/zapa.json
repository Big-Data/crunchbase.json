The technology could enable the growth in the market for contactless credit cards and other forms of identification and transaction.</p>\n\n<p>Zapa is the first company in Europe to deploy NFC technology in a scaled environment via the ZapaTag.</p>\n\n<p>It is estimated that all mobile handsets sold within the next three years will be NFC-compliant. Zapa intends to bridge this deployment gap by the introduction of the ZapaTag and deploying contactless readers at the point of sale, showcasing Ireland as a model for the deployment and execution of NFC services.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0006/0834/60834v1-max-150x150.png"],[[163,81],"assets/images/resized/0006/0834/60834v1-max-250x250.png"],[[163,81],"assets/images/resized/0006/0834/60834v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Nagle","permalink":"john-nagle","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€2.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://siliconrepublic.com/news/article/13349/comms/delta-invests-2-5m-in-near-field-communication-venture/","source_description":"Delta invests â‚¬2.5m in Near Field Communication venture","raised_amount":2500000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Delta Partners","permalink":"delta-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0003/4249/34249v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/4249/34249v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/4249/34249v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Irish Office","address1":"The Grange","address2":"Stillorgan Road","zip_code":"","city":"Dublin","state_code":null,"country_code":"IRL","latitude":53.2801425,"longitude":-6.1590751}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://siliconrepublic.com/news/article/13349/comms/delta-invests-2-5m-in-near-field-communication-venture/","title":"Delta invests â‚¬2.5m in Near Field Communication venture"}]}
