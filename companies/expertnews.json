If this model succeeds, it can fundamentally shift the power in the news business from the publishing companies to the individual editors/authors/experts and can encourage quality journalism. expertnews.me also bridges the gap between &#8220;professional&#8221; journalists and &#8220;amateur&#8221; bloggers - you are either an &#8220;expert&#8221; for your topics or you are not based on your stories and not based on your pay check.  </p>\n\n<p>expertnews uses a facebook-style feed-view to show users the news that are most relevant to them. Users can customize their feed by following experts (i.e. a single person from a newspaper or a complete blog) from the expert directory with a single click on &#8220;follow&#8221; or by adding their own experts. expertnews.me uses both the RSS-feed and twitter of the expert as data sources (more data sources (facebook, &#8230;) can be also be added later). </p>\n\n<p>Main Features in overview:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Follow news in a simple feed format (which you are used to from facebook)</li>\n<li>Discover the best an most important sources/experts for your topics in the expert directory</li>\n<li>Compile expert teams around specific topics (e.g. Hamburg or iphone development) and share them</li>\n<li>Share and comment your stories easily via facebook and/or twitter</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since expertnews.me has the technology to take out single experts/authors from a complete newspaper RSS-feeds, authors/experts/editors get more bargaining power: Users no longer &#8220;buy the newspaper&#8221; - they follow individual editors who they trust in specific topics. Users can be their own &#8220;publishing house&#8221; and compile their own editorial staff. If authors/experts change their employer, they will take their &#8220;followers&#8221; with them. Therefore since individual authors are more visible and rewarded by earning followers, quality journalism is encouraged. </p>\n\n<p>In short: expertnews.me combines the best of twitter, RSS and a rated experts/authors directory. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>simplicity from twitter: follow experts by simply clicking on &#8220;follow&#8221; (easier than copy+paste RSS link)</li>\n<li>rich data from google reader: Having pictures and a few more lines of text is nicer than a shortened url on twitter</li>\n<li>&#8220;qype for authors/experts&#8221;: find the most relevant experts for your topics</li>\n<li>social graph from twitter and facebook: no need to establish new &#8220;friendships&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>just go to expertnews.me to check out an early alpha version</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/5388/45388v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0004/5388/45388v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,245],"assets/images/resized/0004/5388/45388v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"expertnews.me","permalink":"expertnews-me","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"20146","city":"Hamburg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":53.5688101,"longitude":9.9819779}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0004/5387/45387v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5387/45387v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,266],"assets/images/resized/0004/5387/45387v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
