They are NOT a ticket broker and they do not own the tickets listed for sale in their marketplace. The MeetMeTix marketplace exists to link fans looking to buy or sell tickets: whenever and wherever. The price of tickets in a listing is determined by each individual seller. They&#8217;re an open marketplace, which allows you to choose from the widest possible selection of tickets.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0021/7389/217389v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[197,51],"assets/images/resized/0021/7389/217389v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[197,51],"assets/images/resized/0021/7389/217389v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/10/meetmetix-raises-500k-seed-funding.html","source_description":"MeetMeTix Raises $500K in Seed Funding","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":26,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Texas Entrepreneur Networks","permalink":"texas-entrepreneur-networks","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Dyer","permalink":"ben-dyer-2","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
