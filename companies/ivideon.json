We, on the other hand, try to make Ivideon as user-friendly as possible. No special knowledge is required, you don&#8217;t need to know anything about hardware and networking technicalities. Just install Ivideon Server and connect your cameras — our service will take care of everything else.</p>\n\n<p>Quick access to live video feeds and video archive, sound recording, motion detection, all the features you would expect from an expensive professional video surveillance system — you name it, it&#8217;s there.</p>\n\n<p>With Ivideon you will be able to build your own video surveillance system in less than 10 minutes — and see what is happening in your office or at home over the Internet. A webcam or IP camera, a free application called Ivideon Server, an account at www.ivideon.com (also free) — and you&#8217;re set.</p>\n\n<p>Ivideon lets you access your live video feeds and surveillance archive using Windows, Linux or Mac OS X desktop applications, mobile clients for Android, iPhone, iPod and iPad — or just a web browser.</p>\n\n<p>Other Ivideon features include (but are not limited to):\n— Mark your surveillance cameras on Google Maps;\n— Share access to your cameras with your employees or friends;\n— Embed live video feed from your camera into your blog or website;\n— Utilize motion detection to record events instead of empty rooms;\n— Axis, D-Link, Hikvision, Dahua, Microdigital, Foscam, Easy-N, Acti, Edimax, TP-Link, Logitech, Genius and many other cameras are supported;\n— Do lots of other things no other video surveillance system can give you.</p>\n\n<p>Ivideon today is:</p>\n\n<p>We have more than 15 data-centers all over the world (USA, Germany, Korea, Netherlands, Brazil, Russia, Kazakstan, Ukraine etc…)</p>\n\n<p>The Ivideon team has the best developers and managers who are well known in professional security and internet-marketing spheres.</p>\n\n<p>Has its own innovative software that manages the work of data centers and allows the use of unlimited cameras all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>Ivideon offers free use.
