The Deadman Heartbeat solution helps IT professionals reduce and mitigate this downtime cost by being the first to know when downtime or an outage occurs, even before the Help desk, and the end-user impact.</p>\n\n<p>How was the solution born?</p>\n\n<p>The solution was built after witnessing repeated business downtime resulting from critical system process and transactions that didn&#8217;t start, stop or simply failed. </p>\n\n<p>These failed processes and transactions were left unattended, and either could not be addressed by existing monitoring solutions or costly development time to implement a solution. And when they failed, the IT administrator was the last to know.</p>\n\n<p>Deadman Heartbeat was built to give IT administratorâ€™s control and peace of mind when something goes wrong, making them the first to know when ANY critical job or process fails. It also empowers the CIO and CTO to reduce the costs (operational and resource) associated to downtime.</p>\n\n<p>How is it going? Even before its official launch Deadman Heartbeat had half a dozen multi-million dollar organizations on board with the solution; Canaccord Financial, BHP Billiton, Avcorp, Neptune Terminals, JYSK, Westshore Terminals, Kinder Morgan, Teck Resources and more, and strong interest from IT managed service providers (MPS).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0022/0930/220930v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0022/0930/220930v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0022/0930/220930v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Slack","permalink":"craig-slack","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Architect","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Dobson","permalink":"john-dobson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Allen","permalink":"michael-allen","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
