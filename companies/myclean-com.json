Their mission is to take the hassle out of finding a trained cleaner and add ease and price transparency to the appointment scheduling process. </p>\n\n<p>MyClean utilizes their unique online platform to enable users to: get a hassle free quote, create a customized account, schedule an appointment with special instructions, and pay for service with a credit card, all online. </p>\n\n<p>Established in 2009</p>\n\n<p>MyClean was founded by a group of colleagues who had discovered how surprisingly difficult it was to get a convenient, timely, professional apartment cleaning in a city as large and diverse as New York City.
