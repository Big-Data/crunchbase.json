Rich content creation is possible with simple, well-designed tooling and allows for real time interaction between members. Users can ask questions and share knowledge, resources, and information with each other. Over time Knodium becomes a knowledge base for students.</p>\n\n<p>Knodium is doing for education what Yammer did for enterprise. It is free for students and instructors. Institutions can pay to claim their networks giving them a greater degree of control and access to analytical insights.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0018/7853/187853v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,112],"assets/images/resized/0018/7853/187853v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,203],"assets/images/resized/0018/7853/187853v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Willmott","permalink":"michael-willmott","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Bennett","permalink":"andy-bennett","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$35k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/04/17/meet-the-teams-working-with-springboard-for-its-london-accelerator-program/","source_description":"Meet the teams working with Springboard for its London accelerator program","raised_amount":35000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Springboard","permalink":"springboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0005/6706/56706v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/6706/56706v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0005/6706/56706v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0021/0359/210359v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0021/0359/210359v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,310],"assets/images/resized/0021/0359/210359v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://inspiredm.com/5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-classroom/","title":"5 Ways Technology is Transforming the Classroom"}]}
