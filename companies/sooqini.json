Sellers sign up for alerts so that they are automatically notified when a request of interest is posted in their location.</p>\n\n<p>Sellers reply to requests with an offer. Buyers check sellers&#8217; offers and profiles and chose one. Payment happens via PayPal or cash.</p>\n\n<p>Sooqini enables individuals and small businesses to find buyers without cost, and uses the power of the crowd to ensure requests get fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Sooqini is available as an iPhone app, and on the web (and mobile web).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0020/2043/202043v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0020/2043/202043v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0020/2043/202043v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"T.","last_name":"Raj Singh","permalink":"t-raj-singh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Commercial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Tiago","last_name":"Mateus","permalink":"tiago-mateus-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Bransby-Williams","permalink":"nick-bransby-williams","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/32740440\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> ","description":"<p>Intro</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7sYQWCKfg0E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>What the heck is Sooqini?</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9E4tTu1DZLc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Sooqini on the BBC</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2283/202283v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2283/202283v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2283/202283v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2284/202284v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2284/202284v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2284/202284v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2285/202285v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2285/202285v2-max-250x250.png"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2285/202285v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/07/26/sooqini-launches-app-for-londoners-to-outsource-tasks-and-plans-european-expansion/","title":"Sooqini launches App to help Londoners outsource tasks"},{"external_url":"http://www.montysoutlook.com/sooqini-mixes-arabic-london-and-vegetables-for-a-new-marketplace/","title":"Sooqini mixes Arabic, London and vegetables for a new marketplace"},{"external_url":"http://www.ukstartup.net/2012/07/sooqini-the-entrepreneurs-handy-helper/","title":"Sooqini – the entrepreneur’s handy helper @sooqini"}]}
