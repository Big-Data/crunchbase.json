Founded in 2004 with the mission to build better, more efficient engines, the company has over 50 employees, almost all in-house engineers and scientists focused on applying their proven technical know-how and expertise, coupled with the industry&#8217;s leading-edge testing, simulation and analysis tools.</p>\n\n<p>The Achates Power opposed-piston, two-stroke, compression-ignition engine is key for the future of clean, efficient and cost-effective passenger- and commercial-vehicle transportation.</p>\n\n<p>Clean</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can comply with the toughest emissions standards in the world - EPA10 and Euro6</li>\n<li>Reduces greenhouse gas emissions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More Efficient</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminates cylinder head, which reduces heat loss</li>\n<li>Eliminates valve train, which reduces frictional loss</li>\n<li>Has a breakthrough combustion system</li>\n<li>Has an advantageous stroke/bore ratio</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Lower Cost</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Has fewer components</li>\n<li>Uses less raw material</li>\n<li>Uses conventional materials and manufacturing processes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Lighter</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Has a smaller displacement</li>\n<li>Eliminates components like the valve train and cylinder head</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To date, the engine has demonstrated a fuel efficiency improvement of more than 20 percent compared to the published performance data of one of the best clean diesel engines (approximately a 55 percent improvement relative to comparable gasoline engines).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0005/4978/54978v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0005/4978/54978v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,61],"assets/images/resized/0005/4978/54978v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Board
