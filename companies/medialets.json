This is called &#8220;asynchronous delivery&#8221; and, unique to Medialets, this is a very significant advantage among rich media ad platforms in mobile and on the web. This style of serving allows us to display and measure an ad even when the device is not connected to the network, and allows for larger files and better, more engaging ad units.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, no other provider can offer the combined pre-click, engagement, and post-click reporting that Medialets does. We can report to both publishers and advertisers what content influences engagement with ads, details about the ads and how users interact with them, and how far down the marketing or purchasing path consumers ultimately go beyond the ad itself. All of this data helps publishers better service their advertisers and helps advertisers make better ads and placement decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Our Services</p>\n\n<p>Medialets recently launched Medialets Create, a certification program that enables the creative community to develop their own high-impact mobile rich media ads for Medialets ad platform. Currently in Beta, Medialets Create gives agencies, production shops and in-house creative teams full control of their mobile campaigns by empowering them with knowledge and tools to build their own rich media ad units.\nMedialets Create &#8220;beta&#8221; participants include some of the industry&#8217;s most innovative and creative companies, including AKQA, AvatarLabs, The Hyperfactory, MRM Worldwide, Ogilvy North America, Razorfish, Southern Realm, Theorem, and The Visionaire Group.</p>\n\n<p>Our Clients</p>\n\n<p>Medialets is the mobile rich media platform of choice for over 75 of the world&#8217;s leading mobile publishers including Bing, Cars.com, CBS, CNN, CondeNast, Esquire, Fandango, FOX, HuffingtonPost.com, New York magazine, The New York Times, NPR, O the Oprah Magazine, Pandora, Slate, Time Inc., The Washington Post, Weatherbug, The Weather Channel, Variety, Yahoo!, among many others.</p>\n\n<p>Our Campaigns</p>\n\n<p>Creatively, Medialets has led the way in showing what can be done in mobile rich media and how brands can create highly engaging consumer experiences within an app.</p>\n\n<p>This ad was created for the Season 3 premiere of HBO&#8217;s True Blood, in partnership with HBO&#8217;s ad agency, PHD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OVx2lErEEo</p>\n\n<p>More recently, Medialets worked with The Weather Channel to create and serve an ad for the Toyota Prius that actually allows the user to draw a shape within the ad and then that shape becomes part of the ad: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUeoecxQ-zs</p>\n\n<p>Additional examples of Medialets&#8217; highly engaging mobile rich media creative can be found on our YouTube page &#8211; http://www.youtube.com/medialets</p>\n\n<p>Our Partners</p>\n\n<p>Medialets has partnered with a majority of the ad industry&#8217;s leading ad networks, mediators and third party ad servers, including AOL AdTech, Nexage, Mojiva, Jumptap and others, through the Medialets Enrich preferred partner program.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Medialets has collaborated with Adobe on on a set of guidelines for mobile rich media, has been selected by RIM to be the mobile rich media ad platform for the new BlackBerry Advertising Service and partnered with Dynamic Logic to provide brand-related metrics for mobile ad campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Our History</p>\n\n<p>Based in New York City, Medialets is a privately held company with marquee investors and a world-class team. </p>\n\n<p>When Medialets was founded in June of 2008, online rich media had already been established as the most effective way for brands to engage users online. Meanwhile, the adoption of smartphones — devices that offered an environment with even greater potential for rich interactivity than desktops — was accelerating quickly. Yet no one had figured out the ad model that took advantage of their most interesting new features. Early on we recognized that if there was a way to tap into the rich potential of smartphones, brands would embrace the ability to deliver highly engaging rich media to mobile users. There was an opportunity to be at the head end of what in a few years had the potential to grow from an emerging market to a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>\n\n<p>We started with the Feedburner model of free developer tools — in our case, application analytics — as a means to build an ad network, with the intent to dive into that data to get a better understanding of what ultimately would work as an ad model. We launched our first rich media ad in April of 2009, a shakeable ad for Dockers and OMD, and immediately was flooded with interest from both brands and publishers wanting to do similar things. But there was a rub: the brands looking to do this kind of advertising generally wanted to advertise in well known publishers&#8217; apps, and the publishers who wanted to do rich media ads wanted to keep them as premium ad products and sell them themselves, rather than have them sold by a network. So with a bit of tuning, we shifted away from an ad network to a platform that allowed publishers to sell rich media ads direct to brands.</p>\n\n<p>Our Funding</p>\n\n<p>In August 2010, Medialets closed a $6 million Series B round of financing, bringing previous investors The Foundry Group and DFJ Gotham back, along with new investors 500 Startups, Dave McClure&#8217;s new venture fund, and Chris Saridakis&#8217; Great Barn Ventures.</p>\n\n<p>Medialets&#8217; Series A round of financing, totaling $4 million, was previously closed in May 2009 and led by investor Foundry Group, with participation from DFJ Gotham and Bobby Yazdani, an early investor in Google.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,107],"assets/images/resized/0002/2106/22106v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[112,107],"assets/images/resized/0002/2106/22106v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[112,107],"assets/images/resized/0002/2106/22106v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman
