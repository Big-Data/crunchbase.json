Per our vision, the BlackBerry game is connected to Shake & Spell on iPhone and Facebook, taking us one step closer to â€œanywhere, anytime, anyoneâ€ gaming. Please find the full press release below.\r\n\r\nSocialDeck Launches First BlackBerryâ€“iPhoneâ€“Facebook Connected Game\r\n\r\nShake & Spell enables real-time game play across leading smartphones and social networks;\r\ncan be distributed through viral channels\r\n\r\nTORONTO and SAN FRANCISCO â€“ August 20, 2009 â€“ SocialDeck has launched Shake & Spell for the BlackBerry, the first iPhoneâ€“Facebookâ€“BlackBerry connected game that lets players on these different platforms compete against each other in real time.\r\n\r\nShake & Spell for the Blackberry is an exciting development in both the mobile and social media markets. It demonstrates how mobile games and social networking platforms such as Facebook can be seamlessly connected so users can engage with one another, regardless of the device, service or platform being used. A Shake & Spell player, for example, can use their Blackberry to compete against a friend that is using the game on their iPhone or Facebook on their desktop computer.\r\n\r\nâ€œShake & Spell was developed on the socialDeck social gaming platform, which lets people connect, communicate, and interact with friends across multiple mobile devices and social networks,â€ said Anish Acharya, socialDeck co-founder and CEO. â€œWeâ€™re now even closer to a truly ubiquitous and social gaming experience where itâ€™s not about how or where the game is played, but rather with whom.â€\r\n\r\nShake & Spell was introduced for the iPhone and Facebook last fall. It currently has over 500,000 users.\r\n\r\nViral Content Discovery and Distribution\r\nShake & Spell also benefits from a unique feature set in the socialDeck platform that enables and encourages the discovery and distribution of games through viral channels, or via cross-game promotion. Shake & Spell can be shared through Twitter and Facebook feeds, as well as email, SMS, and Facebook invites, making it easy for new users to discover the game.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe top-ranked applications featured in mobile app stores continue to get the lionâ€™s share of downloads,â€ said Acharya. â€œThe ability to cross-pollinate Shake & Spell between devices and social networking platforms means that the game can now reach new and potentially untapped audiences by driving its discovery regardless of the gameâ€™s ranking within a mobile app store.â€\r\n\r\nThe following video clip demonstrates Shake & Spellâ€™s cross-platform game play: http://bit.ly/NqWse\r\n\r\nAbout SocialDeck\r\nSocialDeck was founded in 2008 with the vision of enabling â€œanywhere, anytime, anyoneâ€ gaming. The company has launched several titles for the iPhone, Facebook, and BlackBerry using its social gaming platform technology, which enables simultaneous game play across multiple mobile devices and social networks.
