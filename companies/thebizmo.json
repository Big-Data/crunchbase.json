Think of TheBizmo as a tool that allows independent artists to promote their work and make a few bucks in the process. If you are currently producing any of the above-mentioned content, you can also have your fans sell your products too, since anyone can copy your Bizmo items and sell them as well. They earn a commission for the sale of your products and anything you change in your Bizmo store automatically changes in theirs. This is an excellent way of spreading your unique material virally across the world. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2962/2962v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2962/2962v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0000/2962/2962v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Music Distribution","permalink":"thebizmo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/8783/168783v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/8783/168783v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/8783/168783v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Gjester","permalink":"david-gjester","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/01/02/thebizmo-music-store-widget-launches-in-uk/","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Burda Digital Ventures","permalink":"burda-digital-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/9747/19747v1-max-150x150.png"],[[240,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/9747/19747v1-max-250x250.png"],[[240,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/9747/19747v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"East Coast Angels","permalink":"east-coast-angels","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Acton Capital Partners","permalink":"acton-capital-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0005/6684/56684v1-max-150x150.png"],[[198,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/6684/56684v1-max-250x250.png"],[[198,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/6684/56684v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.500152,"longitude":-0.126236}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
