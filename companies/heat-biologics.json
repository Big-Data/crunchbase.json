Heat’s ImPACT therapy is a first-in-class fully human adjuvant system that functions as both an immune stimulator and an antigen-delivery system. ImPACT is rapidly applied to a selected off-the-shelf cancer cell line to effectively transform living tumor into powerful machines that “pump out” their full antigenic fingerprint to robustly stimulate the immune system against the targeted disease. ImPACT is applicable to a wide range of cancers as well as infectious diseases including HIV, HCV and malaria. Heat is currently in Phase II clinical trials with its first drug to treat Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and plans to initiate clinical trials against additional cancers in 2012. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0019/0755/190755v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0019/0755/190755v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,87],"assets/images/resized/0019/0755/190755v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.8M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/heat-biologics-inc-series-a-28m/","source_description":"Heat Biologics, Inc.: Series A $2.8M","raised_amount":2800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Brightline Ventures","permalink":"brightline-ventures","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"100 Europa Drive, Suite 420","address2":"","zip_code":"27517","city":"Chapel Hill","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0019/0756/190756v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0019/0756/190756v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,367],"assets/images/resized/0019/0756/190756v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
