(Random number to each tweet to get above the duplicate text implemented by Twitter)</p>\n\n<p>Which is one of the core features that I love about Caltweet is their control over auto tweets to promote their events &amp; products even when there not online up to 4 times per day to prevent spamming we limited this, but will allow customization of each custom tweet in the future for &#8220;Caltweet Business&#8221; amongst other features that give users more control over there promotional efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Other features include:</p>\n\n<p>RSVP confirmation which will prompt to allows us to update their twitter &amp; facebook status with &#8220;@MichaelRevell is attending Techcrunch writes about Caltweet http://caltweet.com/r1 &lt;&#8211;Click to Attend&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>You can invite the people that follow you, but NOT the people you follow. Your followers can also invite their followers. When invited the system sends a DM to the user on Twitter that says &#8220;@username is inviting you to Techcrunch writes about Caltweet http://caltweet.com/r1&lt;&#8211;click to attend</p>\n\n<p>The system organizes a twitter guestlist and also google maps integrated and google calendar syncs for events. When logged in the system.</p>\n\n<p>All these and more are features on the user side.</p>\n\n<p>On the event search side. You can find events by tags, auto-generated Ajax search, and also separate events by city/state on the All Events page.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen people promoting events, to products, website launches, online coupons and more. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/2834/62834v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0006/2834/62834v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/2834/62834v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Web Development","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Revell","permalink":"michael-revell","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing Development","person":{"first_name":"Fredrickus","last_name":"Williford","permalink":"fredrickus-williford","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"User Interface Development","person":{"first_name":"Rodtez","last_name":"Black","permalink":"rodtez-black","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0006/2833/62833v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0006/2833/62833v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,238],"assets/images/resized/0006/2833/62833v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
