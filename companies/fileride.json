All this without exposing any of your document names, contents or private information outside the realm of your own computer. FileRide is designed to be as private and secure as possible while leaving lots of room for social interaction! Our goal is to help like-minded people connect and promote democracy through universal access to media related forums.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/0026/30026v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/0026/30026v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/0026/30026v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"FileRide","permalink":"fileride","image":null},{"name":"Yepler","permalink":"yepler","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Patrik","last_name":"Hedmalm","permalink":"patrik-hedmalm","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, VP Community & Web Services","person":{"first_name":"Klokie","last_name":"Grossfeld","permalink":"klokie-grossfeld","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Teknikringen 33","address2":"","zip_code":"114 28","city":"Stockholm","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0003/0025/30025v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0003/0025/30025v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,379],"assets/images/resized/0003/0025/30025v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/fileride_social_network_around.php","title":"FileRide on RWW"},{"external_url":"http://netzwertig.com/2008/11/25/fileride-vielleicht-das-naechste-grosse-ding/","title":"FileRide on Netzwertig (German)"},{"external_url":"http://mindpark.se/2008/11/26/fileride-ett-socialt-natverk-baserat-pa-intresse/","title":"FileRide on Mindpark (Swedish)"}]}
