The environmental impacts and congestion associated with transport create additional costs for both users and providers (one US report put the cost of congestion in the US at $87 billion in 2007, and Transport for London thinks that congestion creates an annual cost of £2-4 billion per annum). It is anticipated that the cost of congestion to the UK market will be over £20 billion per annum if left unchecked by 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon Voyage has built a cloud service that seeks to efficiently match up transport users and providers. Through building an effective market place, we can provide benefits to both users of transport and providers of transport through finding opportunities to share journeys, fill empty return journeys and also using the best mode of transport from a cost, carbon or time perspective. The use of a reverse auction system will allow competitive rates to be provided to transport users; transport providers will also be able to advertise spare capacity which will unlock additional savings. Through user feedback and ratings, Carbon Voyage will ultimately set up a system where trusted freight companies can be used to meet customer needs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0015/4748/154748v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,111],"assets/images/resized/0015/4748/154748v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/4748/154748v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Product Incubation","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Harmonypark","permalink":"harmonypark-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[50,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/0810/80810v6-max-150x150.png"],[[50,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/0810/80810v6-max-250x250.png"],[[50,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/0810/80810v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"35 Kingsland Road","address2":"","zip_code":"E2 8AA","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Earls Court and Olympia, some of the UK's best know event venues launch partnership with Carbon Voyage to promote low carbon transport","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":19,"source_url":"http://eventindustrynews.co.uk/blog/2012/03/19/eco-teams-up-with-carbon-voyage-to-launch-ground-breaking-transport-initiative/","source_text":null,"source_description":"EC&O Teams Up With Carbon Voyage To Launch Ground-Breaking Transport Initiative","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Carbon Voyage","permalink":"carbon-voyage"}},{"description":"Yesterday saw the launch of another great initiative in Tech City – an IT recycling project, to help East London startups cost-effectively dispose of their computer hardware in environmentally friendly fashion.
