It offers financing as well as business consulting along with other opportunities to 2-4 person companies looking to take an idea to a product. Y Combinator looks for companies with &#8220;good&#8221; ideas over companies with experience and a business model.  The company made its first investments in Summer 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Y Combinator selects companies to finance and consult with twice a year. They are located in <a href=\"/maps/city/Mountain%2520View\" title=\"Mountain View, CA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mountain View, CA</a>. Companies that they decide to fund generally receive $5,000 plus an additional $5,000 per founder and are required to relocate to Y Combinator&#8217;s destination for the following three months. In return, Y Combinator asks for 2-10% ownership, generally considered fairly steep considering the small investment. However, Y Combinator argues that this seed money and mentorship is crucial to for the success of small startups. </p>\n\n<p>Y Combinator continues to grow, with a stated target of 60 funded companies for the Winter 2010 session. </p>\n\n<p>Successful exits by Y Combinator funded companies include \n<a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/reddit\" title=\"Reddit\">Reddit</a>, <a
