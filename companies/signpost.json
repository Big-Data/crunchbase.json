Some people say that Signpost is creating the Google AdSense of local commerce, and to that extent it currently powers monetization campaigns for over 1,200 local publishers that range from mobile apps to directory services to daily deals sites. </p>\n\n<p>Signpost puts local businesses in control of their marketing campaigns by providing them with a suite of tools that drive new customers during slow periods and bring first-time visitors back. The service is available nationwide, with NYC, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago as its biggest markets.</p>\n\n<p>Signpost is funded by Google Ventures, Spark Capital (Foursquare, Twitter, Tumblr) and a rockstar group of angel investors including Jason Calacanis (TWIST), Jack Herrick (e-how) and Thomas Lehrman (Gerson Lehrman).
