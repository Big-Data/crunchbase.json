The nice part of the TapMetrics solution is that while it does a great job on the business metrics of running an iPhone application, it does just as good of a job serving the needs of the engineer. </p>\n\n<p>Everything from detailed environmental data (which iPhone/Touch hardware is being used, which OS level, which release level of the application), to detailed crash reporting, to application messaging/event logs, and session tracking are supported within the integrated TapMetrics experience.  </p>\n\n<p>They also have a free Mac OS X app called TapMini that you can use to automatically download sales data for your iPhone applications.  If you are trying to get more out of your iPhone application portfolio (both in terms of improving the consumer experience and making more revenue), this can be a really useful tool.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0005/5275/55275v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/5275/55275v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,185],"assets/images/resized/0005/5275/55275v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nolan","last_name":"Brown","permalink":"nolan-brown","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0007/6901/76901v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0007/6901/76901v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0007/6901/76901v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Brown","permalink":"christopher-brown-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/0576/130576v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/0576/130576v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[409,307],"assets/images/resized/0013/0576/130576v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.launchboxdigital.com/portfolio/launchbox09-portfolio/","source_description":"LaunchBox 09 Portfolio","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":4,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"LaunchBox Digital","permalink":"launchbox-digital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/9357/29357v1-max-150x150.png"],[[229,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/9357/29357v1-max-250x250.png"],[[229,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/9357/29357v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2010/02/23/mobile-ad-network-millennial-media-acquires-analytics-firm-tapmetrics/","source_description":"Mobile ad network Millennial Media acquires analytics firm TapMetrics","acquired_year":2010,"acquired_month":2,"acquired_day":23,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Millennial Media","permalink":"millennial-media","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0004/8763/48763v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/8763/48763v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/8763/48763v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"TapMetrics acquired by Millennial Media.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":23,"source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2010/02/23/mobile-ad-network-millennial-media-acquires-analytics-firm-tapmetrics/","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"TapMetrics","permalink":"tapmetrics"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5941507&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5941507&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></embed></object><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5941507\">Unblab: The End of Email Overload</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user2127140\">Unblaboratory, Inc.</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
