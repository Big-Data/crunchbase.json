David Pirnazar and Sapient co-founder Jerry A. Greenberg in January 2009. Our patent-pending technology enables users to simultaneously surf and interact with the same sites together while generating highly targeted traffic for partnered sites. samesurf&#8217;s application and browser-based offerings enable every user to interact with online content, customer support personnel and each other in real-time. The technology is tailored to empower multiple users to shop, watch crystal clear videos, browse documents, book travel and surf the web together without requiring installs, plug-ins, or downloads.</p>\n\n<p>samesurf&#8217;s cross platform technology enables as few as 2 and as many as 5000 people to &#8220;surf together&#8221; across multiple computers and mobile devices with existing friends in private rooms and new friends they&#8217;ll meet in public rooms. samesurf is accessible via:  (1) embed on partnered sites; (2) a cross-platform application for computers, mobile devices and tablets;  and (3) at samesurf.com.</p>\n\n<p>The embed technology requires the integration of a couple lines of code, takes a few minutes to embed onto any site and functions within all browsers - &#8220;it just works.&#8221; The technology essentially acts as a lead generation and conversion rate catalyst for partnered sites that also heightens user satisfaction, dwell times and sociability levels for users. samesurf enables friends and site support personnel to: (1) samesurf the same sites together; (2) chat from one place across multiple chat clients; (3) audio and video chat; (4) share cursor movements and screen markings in real-time; (5) update their status and send tweets; and (6) send &#8220;single link&#8221; invites via one source across all platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The app version supports the Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android platforms while the browser-based version works seamlessly on any computer or mobile device.</p>\n\n<p>samesurf/Actual Worlds, Inc. is currently in advanced discussions with several leading websites to embed its technology within their online experiences. The Company has three U.S. patents pending on its underlying technology and has filed a PCT Application to protect its intellectual property throughout international territories. samesurf/Actual Worlds, Inc. recently closed on an equity financing round that was led by Beverly Hills, CA-based Omninet Capital. Omninet Capital was established by co-founders of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Sapient (NASDAQ: SAPE) serves as the Company&#8217;s launch advisor.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0014/6754/146754v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0014/6754/146754v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6754/146754v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer/Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"K.
