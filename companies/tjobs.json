We are using the full breadth and depth of internet technologies and network effects to supply hundreds of qualified temporary or permanent (predominantly blue collar) workers literally overnight, and provide consistent post-recruitment support.</p>\n\n<p>Our online portal provides partner agencies with useful workflow tools and marketplace functionalities, while candidates find a constant stream of up-to-date high quality job offers.</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, our staffing solutions ensure higher quality execution, more experienced and better suited personnel, and are faster, more flexible and more affordable than any comparable service on the market. </p>\n\n<p>Tjobs has started revolutionizing the global HR Services sector (that has not seen true innovation since the arrival of online job postings in the 1990s), by vastly improving the efficiency of the recruiting process for all stakeholders: employers, candidates and agents.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Calin","last_name":"Stefanescu","permalink":"calin-stefanescu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Cser","permalink":"andreas-cser","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Adecco","permalink":"adecco","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1923/21923v1-max-150x150.png"],[[149,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1923/21923v1-max-250x250.png"],[[149,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1923/21923v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kelly Services","permalink":"kelly-services-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"randstad","permalink":"randstad","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0020/8940/208940v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,117],"assets/images/resized/0020/8940/208940v2-max-250x250.png"],[[267,125],"assets/images/resized/0020/8940/208940v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"manpower","permalink":"manpower","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"USG People","permalink":"usg-people","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Trenkwalder","permalink":"trenkwalder","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Fundatia Post Privatizare","permalink":"fundatia-post-privatizare","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"Mihai Eminescu No. 60","address2":"","zip_code":"540331","city":"Targu Mures","state_code":null,"country_code":"ROM","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"France Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"69006","city":"Lyon","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"London Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"SW1W 9BJ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
