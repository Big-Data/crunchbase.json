Founders of newly hatched companies ask for advice or for people to join on if interested.  Similar to <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/y-combinator\" title=\"Y Combinator\">Y Combinator</a> and <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/techstars\" title=\"TechStars\">TechStars</a>, Cofoundr potentially provides young companies with all the resources they could want minus direct financing and a physical community.Users can search for Cofoundr members by area of expertise, working status, geography or any other keyword.
