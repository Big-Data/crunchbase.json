We&#8217;re counting on ustreams becoming quite a big thing in the near future.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8496/98496v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/8496/98496v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/8496/98496v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co Founder","person":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Wood","permalink":"elizabeth-wood","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Searles","permalink":"rob-searles","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Berlin Office","address1":"Legiendamm 14","address2":"","zip_code":"10179","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0009/8495/98495v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,230],"assets/images/resized/0009/8495/98495v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,414],"assets/images/resized/0009/8495/98495v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0011/1010/111010v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0011/1010/111010v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,274],"assets/images/resized/0011/1010/111010v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
