However, we knew that such interactivity was limited and unidirectional. Also, the concept of real time had been bandied about for some considerable time, but, in the vast majority of cases, what really existed were “almost real time” propositions trying to reproduce the real thing and - in the few cases where there was actual real time information - the technology that enabled it was very expensive, limited in applications and the privilege of just a few.</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, Realtime® is a technology that comes to life via 4 products that allow website visitors to interact in real time with the website server. \nSo whether they are shopping online, visiting a newspaper site or just browsing, they can receive dedicated information, be offered products based on a truly individual profile that can be updated second by second, or receive special ad contents pushed to the browser, namely: </p>\n\n<p>Open Realtime Connectivity - ORTC®\nConveys the information from the website to the user’s browser at the very moment it is altered or requested.</p>\n\n<p>Extensible Realtime Markup Language - xRTML®\nIt is a simple yet revolutionary development of the html language that allows for quick and seamless integration of Realtime® technology into websites, with plug-ins for external platforms such as Wordpress and Blogger. </p>\n\n<p>Power Marketing® \nTurns CRM from a projective / reactive marketing tool into a present / proactive one, thus exponentially increasing sales potential and data gathering levels whilst at the same time reducing decision-taking time.</p>\n\n<p>Ad Server®\nUnleashes the hitherto constrained potential of online advertising by turning banners into true ads, and also optimizes the online media auditing, tracking, planning and buying cycle by putting online advertisers in contact with the demonstrably best available spaces for their needs at the very moment they become available.</p>\n\n<p>On August 8, 2012, Realtime announced its U.S. launch with a $100 million investment from BRZTech Holding, a Sao Paulo-based technology investment.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/9090/169090v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/9090/169090v4-max-250x250.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/9090/169090v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"Mora Funes","permalink":"rafael-mora-funes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"André","last_name":"T Parreira","permalink":"andr-t-parreira","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Paulo","last_name":"Carreira Gomes","permalink":"paulo-carreira-gomes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Luís","last_name":"Rasquilha","permalink":"lus-rasquilha","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sales, EVP","person":{"first_name":"Alexandre","last_name":"Botelho","permalink":"alexandre-botelho","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Dulce","last_name":"Parreira","permalink":"dulce-parreira","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Brazil Operations","person":{"first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"Martins","permalink":"gilberto-martins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Client Acquisition, US","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Facter","permalink":"david-facter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/6339/186339v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[194,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/6339/186339v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/6339/186339v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of US Operations","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Batkin","permalink":"andrew-batkin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Iberia Operations","person":{"first_name":"Nuno","last_name":"Brilha","permalink":"nuno-brilha","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"EC2 Cloud Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Amazon Web Services","permalink":"amazon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$100M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/realtime-nabs-100-million-to-make-the-internet-more-like-live-tv-2012-8","source_description":"Realtime Raises $100 Million To Make The Internet More Like Live TV","raised_amount":100000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":8,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"BRZtech Group","permalink":"brztech-group","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"United States","address1":"1000 Highview Avenue, Manhattan Beach","address2":"40 -
