This is particularly important when they are providing strategic advice about what represents a marketable item - their customers know that they believe what they say because they take a stake in their success.</p>\n\n<p>Managerial</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes projects fail because the vision is not clear or because the leadership cannot gather the appropriate information and disseminate it. They work with their clients to develop products but also to make sure communication is working both up and down in the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Board of Directors</p>\n\n<p>They have taken a seat on the board of directors of some of their clients because of the quality and diversity of the assistance they provide.</p>\n\n<p>Tactical</p>\n\n<p>Aside from providing advice, they will also implement the strategies that they propose. This is especially important when a customer has tried and failed on his own in a particular area and needs something done quickly. Some of their technical expertise lies in:</p>\n\n<p>Mathematical Modeling (hold a patent in simulated annealing) Business Modeling (cost of operations analysis, ROI tools, process modeling) Compilers / language translators (makers of VB to C++ translator among other translators) Application Conversions (automatic and manual translations) Software Localization (developed methodology for D&amp;B for translation into 19 languages) Performance Tuning (for several clients this has been algorithmic changes that resulted in orders of magnitude differences) Web sites (many such clients) Expert Systems (developed a high-end customer requirements/vendor capability mapping system) Clients</p>\n\n<p>They have helped companies from the size of Avaya, D&amp;B and PaineWebber to companies of smaller size bring their products to market and manage their businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Their business model is a unique offering and the process necessarily begins by interviewing line-of-business managers to identify their priorities and pain-points. The first meeting will result in an assessment that almost always leads interesting insights into areas for improvement and /or new business possibilities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0003/1868/31868v1-max-150x150.png"],[[234,46],"assets/images/resized/0003/1868/31868v1-max-250x250.png"],[[234,46],"assets/images/resized/0003/1868/31868v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Hirsch","permalink":"david-hirsch","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6963/16963v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,225],"assets/images/resized/0001/6963/16963v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,225],"assets/images/resized/0001/6963/16963v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Rhodes","permalink":"scott-rhodes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Arkady","last_name":"Dudko","permalink":"arkady-dudko-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Research Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Phil","last_name":"Johnston","permalink":"philip-johnston","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Corp.1040 Avenue Of The Americas 24th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"10018","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
