Isabella focuses on creating intuitive, simple and innovative devices by leveraging the very latest in hardware, software and wireless technologies to create a rich user experience. Isabella is guided in its technological innovation by four core principles: modular design; open-source software development; touch interface; and scalable architecture. These four elements allow Isabella to rapidly design and develop new products and services cost effectively. The companyâ€™s seasoned team of professionals have built and managed some of the worldâ€™s greatest consumer successes at companies such as Motorola, Reebok, Disney and Bose.</p>\n\n<p>Products\nWith its initial product, VizitÂ®, Isabella has created the first twoâ€way digital photo frame that is able to receive and send photos and other imageâ€based content (messaging, maps, drawings, advertising, etc) remotely. Vizit is a communications device that allows users to receive content from smart phones, PCâ€™s, and other Internet connected sources creating an immediate contentâ€sharing experience between friends and family. The frame has been designed using an ARM 11 processor, embedded Linux, Flash Lite, and a highly intuitive touchscreen interface facilitating a very simple and impactful experience. Additionally, Vizit can be managed remotely from the VizitMe.com, allowing for convenient account management and further sharing for friends and family.</p>\n\n<p>Isabella is currently developing two additional devices expected to reach the U.S. market in 2011. These additional products will also use the VizitMe content management platform for distributing and managing content and devices across the network. Miniâ„¢ is a 3G USB stick that runs the VizitMe application on existing â€˜dumbâ€™ (unconnected) digital photo frames or other display products (e.g. televisions, portable gaming devices, tablets). Images are downloaded from VizitMe.com and stored locally in the USB flash memory for display on the host device, which takes advantage of the existing 18 million digital photo frames currently installed and brings remote access photo delivery to them.</p>\n\n<p>The third product, Fableâ„¢, is the worldâ€™s first connected childrenâ€™s tablet. Fable is a 7â€, fullâ€touch, color display device running four core applications including (1) an eReader; (2) drawing; (3) gaming; and (4) a photo album. Fable will be integrated with the existing VizitMe.com content management server to allow content from Isabellaâ€™s entire product portfolio (eg. Vizit, MiNi, Fable) to be shared by Fable and vice versa. eBooks, games, and other content will be securely stored within the VizitMe subscriberâ€™s account.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0012/8117/128117v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[250,226],"assets/images/resized/0012/8117/128117v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[450,407],"assets/images/resized/0012/8117/128117v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Vizit","permalink":"vizit-2","image":null},{"name":"Fable","permalink":"fable","image":null},{"name":"Mini","permalink":"mini","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Growney","permalink":"matthew-growney","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5350/125350v2-max-150x150.png"],[[183,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5350/125350v2-max-250x250.png"],[[287,391],"assets/images/resized/0012/5350/125350v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Isabella Headquarters","address1":"33 Bradford St. ","address2":"Second Floor","zip_code":"01742","city":"Concord","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
