Besides interesting recommendations, their users can also share their interest profiles to show the world what they like and find people with matching interests.</p>\n\n<p>The team got together in early 2007 with the vision of creating a more meaningful web that can adapt its contents to each user&#8217;s interests, and a more credible web where you can discover the real people behind each username. A public beta will be launched in September. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/4792/24792v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/4792/24792v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/4792/24792v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"Siris","permalink":"santiago-siri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7776/57776v2-max-150x150.png"],[[179,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/7776/57776v2-max-250x250.png"],[[323,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/7776/57776v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Santiago Siri / [Popego] (www.popego.com)</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","person":{"first_name":"Emiliano","last_name":"Kargieman","permalink":"emiliano-kargieman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"investor","person":{"first_name":"Wenceslao","last_name":"Casares","permalink":"wenceslao-casares","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6516/96516v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6516/96516v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[318,319],"assets/images/resized/0009/6516/96516v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Mariano","last_name":"Cortesi","permalink":"mariano-cortesi","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"Sosnik","permalink":"esteban-sosnik","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Wenceslao","last_name":"Casares","permalink":"wenceslao-casares","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6516/96516v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6516/96516v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[318,319],"assets/images/resized/0009/6516/96516v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Aconcagua Ventures","permalink":"aconcagua-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/7253/27253v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/7253/27253v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/7253/27253v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Monashees Capital","permalink":"monashees-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/1253/51253v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0005/1253/51253v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0005/1253/51253v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Research & Development","address1":"Cabrera 5722 #1","address2":"","zip_code":"1414BHH","city":"Buenos Aires","state_code":null,"country_code":"ARG","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94102","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.778687,"longitude":-122.421242}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/hRbNvQUA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2008/09/techcrunch50-pr.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"},{"embed_code":"<object id=\"otv_o_693250\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\"  classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param value=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/699964\" name=\"movie\" /><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\" /><param value=\"always\" name=\"allowScriptAccess\" /><param value=\"transparent\" name=\"wmode\" /><param value=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" name=\"flashvars\" /><embed name=\"otv_e_673599\" id=\"otv_e_527726\" flashvars=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/699964\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /></object>","description":"<p>tc50</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
