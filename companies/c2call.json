C2Call (Click-to-Call) developed a Java-based and cloud-hosted VoIP application that instantly turns any web browser into a phone. Using Java Virtual Machine (JVM), calls are made directly from any browser without the installation of proprietary software such as Adobe Flash, or other plug-ins.</p>\n\n<p>C2Call&#8217;s JVM VoIP phone can be initiated instantly from a Website, Instant Message (IM) app, e-mail or hyperlink providing peer-to-peer VoIP calls. In addition to its unique capabilities, this application is compatible with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is based on the same VoIP standard supported by Cisco, Avaya, Nokia, Vonage, and many other VoIP market leaders. C2Call’s core technology works with Windows, Mac, Linux, Android OS, and will also soon be available for Google’s Chrome OS.</p>\n\n<p>It supports browser based echo cancellation, conferencing and just recently launched cross–platform, Multi–Party, Real Group Video Calling feature available for WebPhone, Android and iOS devices (iPhone, iPod touch and iPad). C2Call’s Java-based VoIP application provides the only platform-independent solution that can leapfrog today’s popular browser-based text chat, Voice and Video Calling.</p>\n\n<p>Description</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the liberty to talk, take FriendCaller with you, wherever you go!
