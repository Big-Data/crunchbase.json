Coullâ€™s platform enables in-video affiliate links which convert that demand into conversions for advertisers and revenue for publishers.</p>\n\n<p>For publishers, we have a large selection of video content from big-name advertisers, all with affiliate links already integrated. These can be added to websites or blogs, and commissions are earned when a viewer engages with the click-able affiliate link in the video. Publishers can also integrate other affiliate links within their own video content to earn revenue on a Cost-Per-Action (sale, lead, sign-up etc) or Cost-Per-Click basis.</p>\n\n<p>Our self-serve platforms gives advertisers a simple way to import their video content and integrate products as actionable links, making it available to our network of high-quality publishers, providing a new channel for generating incremental revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Visit www.coull.com to find out more and sign-up today!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/6941/16941v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[230,78],"assets/images/resized/0001/6941/16941v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[230,78],"assets/images/resized/0001/6941/16941v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Coull Affiliator","permalink":"coull-affiliator","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Aden","last_name":"Forshaw","permalink":"aden-forshaw","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Irfon","last_name":"Watkins","permalink":"irfon-watkins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and U.S./Canada Operations","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Kiblinger","permalink":"ben-kiblinger","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman and CFO ","person":{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Holcroft","permalink":"bernard-holcroft","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO ","person":{"first_name":"Dean","last_name":"Taylor","permalink":"dean-taylor","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"VideoClix","permalink":"videoclix","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0001/7302/17302v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7302/17302v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[309,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/7302/17302v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Clikthrough","permalink":"clikthrough","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0003/1556/31556v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0003/1556/31556v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[297,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1556/31556v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"VideoClix","permalink":"videoclix","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0001/7302/17302v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7302/17302v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[309,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/7302/17302v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Clikthrough","permalink":"clikthrough","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0003/1556/31556v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0003/1556/31556v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[297,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1556/31556v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wire_Wax","permalink":"wire-wax","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Coull UK","address1":"6th Floor Centre Gate ","address2":"Colston Avenue","zip_code":"BS1 4TR ","city":"Bristol ","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Coull USA","address1":"415 E Ocean Ave.","address2":"Suite F","zip_code":"93436","city":"Lompoc","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"\t\r\nApril 13, 2012\r\nCoull acquire RevUpNet to establish US presence\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nCoull, which is the sole video partner of Google Affiliate Network, is acquiring California based RevUpNet, an established and profitable online marketing agency, for $2 million.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":3,"source_url":"http://blog.coull.com/2012/04/13/coull-acquire-revupnet-to-establish-us-presence/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Coull acquire RevUpNet to establish US presence","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Coull ","permalink":"coull"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"300px\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"250px\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://network.coull.com/embediframe/?v=15687&t=747&pid=2131&auto_play=false&muted=true&volume=0\"></iframe>","description":"<p>Travelocity On Coull</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"300px\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"250px\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://network.coull.com/embediframe/?v=18727&t=747&pid=5377&muted=true&volume=0.5\"></iframe>","description":"<p>HowAboutWe On Coull</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
