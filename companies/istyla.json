I am 14 years old and I live in Cape Town, South Africa. I would like to tell you about iStyla.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a post someone had &#8220;shared&#8221; on Facebook that said you can get a Pink Facebook. Me, loving the colour pink, obviously clicked on it. To my surprise, I had to fill in a survey, share it and like it, then I could get my Pink Theme. Well, I did all of that, but they gave me some message saying my browser is not supported. I was using Google Chrome at the time, and I was quite surprised that they did not have support for one of the world&#8217;s most popular browsers. Turned out this &#8216;Pink Facebook&#8217; thing was an elaborate hoax.</p>\n\n<p>I thought how awesome it would be if you had something like this that actually works. I imagined something that could make Facebook pink. I started working on a Google Chrome extension (I had some HTML &amp; JavaScript experience) in February of 2012. I have now finished with iStyla and it is ready for a public beta. I have a theme store, where you can install a theme of choice. People can even create their own themes with a WYSIWYG interface. There is obviously, a pink theme, free of charge, of course.</p>\n\n<p>Why would someone want themes for Facebook? Well, I have added another feature to iStyla too! If an iStyla user visits another iStyla user&#8217;s Facebook profile, their Facebook theme will switch to the person&#8217;s profile they are viewing&#8217;s current theme. The iStyla public beta is FREE and available to anyone to sign up.</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate you taking a look at my iStyla and perhaps featuring it on CrunchBase. This would really help me grow my website&#8217;s users. Please check it out at www.iStyla.com. I have over 850 users as of this date and over 1100 Facebook likes. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nJacques Blom</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0021/2638/212638v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0021/2638/212638v2-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0021/2638/212638v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jacques","last_name":"Blom","permalink":"jacques-blom","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0021/2636/212636v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0021/2636/212636v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,310],"assets/images/resized/0021/2636/212636v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0021/2637/212637v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0021/2637/212637v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,196],"assets/images/resized/0021/2637/212637v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
