High school comes and goes and after a swift four years, not much is left to take with you but a few graded homework assignments and vague memories. Yes, graduation is something that we all look forward to—but it’s a bittersweet moment isn’t? For as exciting as graduation may be, it also means closing a chapter of our lives and starting a new one; it’s a time in our life where we say a lot more ‘Hope-to-see-you-soon’ than ‘see-you-tomorrow’. It’s for this very purpose that yearbooks are created. Its purpose is to not only be able to look back and laugh at that silly hairdo we once had but also to delight ourselves in the accomplishments that we worked hard to achieve. But what good is a yearbook when all we see is a name and a face? We, at DYP, understand that behind every picture is a story that’s too unique to be left untold. So go ahead!
