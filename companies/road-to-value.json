We help to identify, enable, and realize shareholder value in all stages of the company life cycle.</p>\n\n<p>The life &amp; value of any investment is characterized by five defining steps. Road to Value is determined to make each step a success, as stand alone project, or as an integrated program:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Idea validation</li>\n<li>Deal structuring</li>\n<li>Value creation</li>\n<li>Turn around</li>\n<li>Exit</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Road to Value works by combining a professional investor toolbox with hands on experience in numerous investment processes. We always work from the perspective that value is created over the long term by 10% inspiration and 90% transpiration.</p>\n\n<p>Key industry focus on healthcare, clean tech, food and ICT.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0020/7168/207168v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0020/7168/207168v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,449],"assets/images/resized/0020/7168/207168v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0020/7167/207167v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0020/7167/207167v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0020/7167/207167v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
