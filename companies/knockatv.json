So far the details are few.  KnockaTV is a project manned by the inventors of one of the first instant messenger clients, ICQ.  It claims it will be a &#8220;hyper-interactive&#8221; as well as social center for video, with user generated content.  Currently, KnockaTV is looking for producers to fill its site with original content.  Once full of content, KnockaTV will allow its users will be able to decided what gets played and when.Companies such as <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/joost\" title=\"Joost\">Joost</a> and <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/youtube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> offer messaging capabilities to their users who are watching the same content (YouTube&#8217;s Streams is in the &#8220;testtube&#8221; phase).  KnockaTV will almost certainly have chat features given the  founders&#8217; previous experience with IM.  Though an interesting concept, video interactivity has not yet been proven popular.  It is arguably very contrary to the way consumers want to watch videos, as TV viewing has always been very passive.  KnockaTV will offer one more way in which users may be enticed to change their behavior.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0000/4078/4078v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,29],"assets/images/resized/0000/4078/4078v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,29],"assets/images/resized/0000/4078/4078v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"KnockaTV","permalink":"knockatv","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Yotam","last_name":"Eshel","permalink":"yotam-eshel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Shailesh","last_name":"Shilwant","permalink":"shailesh-shilwant","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/06/icq-founders-start-knockatv/#comments","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":3500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Evergreen Venture Partners","permalink":"evergreen-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-150x150.png"],[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-250x250.png"],[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Sefi","last_name":"Visiger","permalink":"sefi-visiger","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Yair","last_name":"Goldfinger","permalink":"yair-goldfinger","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Arik","last_name":"Vardi","permalink":"arik-vardi","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Eilon","last_name":"Tirosh","permalink":"eilon-tirosh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2367/202367v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[186,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2367/202367v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[245,329],"assets/images/resized/0020/2367/202367v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Eilon Tirosh</p>"}}}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.vccafe.com/2007/06/19/knockatv-raises-1m/","source_description":"KnockaTV Raises $1M","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":11,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Evergreen Venture Partners","permalink":"evergreen-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-150x150.png"],[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-250x250.png"],[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":31.046051,"longitude":34.851612}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
