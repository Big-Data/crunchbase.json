Hiring managers tell us that applications for these jobs look mostly similar and that the interview is EVERYTHING. Instead of a traditional resume, candidates respond to common and portable interview questions via Web cam and mobile device that we call a First Impression. No longer will job seekers travel to complete paper applications in hopes that they are called back in for an interview. Employers review interviews anywhere and anytime. First Impressions save seekers and employers money and time and helps us all save the planet. </p>\n\n<p>The world&#8217;s first on-demand job fair.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0013/6227/136227v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,102],"assets/images/resized/0013/6227/136227v4-max-250x250.png"],[[396,162],"assets/images/resized/0013/6227/136227v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Atherton","permalink":"dave-atherton","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jody","last_name":"Presti","permalink":"jody-presti","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/8060/138060v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/8060/138060v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,259],"assets/images/resized/0013/8060/138060v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Marketing Officer","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Ourand","permalink":"chris-ourand","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$250k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":25,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Jody","last_name":"Presti","permalink":"jody-presti","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/8060/138060v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/8060/138060v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,259],"assets/images/resized/0013/8060/138060v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"JobOn","address1":"1602 Village Market Blvd. SE, Ste. 260","address2":"","zip_code":"20175","city":"Leesburg","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
