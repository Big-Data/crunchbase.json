The platform provides a drag and drop interface with a full slate of ready-made features.  For those with needs beyond the feature set, MobileIgniter provides an API for custom development and a feature marketplace where developers can show off their creations.  Our modules leverage the full capabilities of the mobile device and our analytics dashboards track exactly how the apps are utilized.</p>\n\n<p>Existing solutions either provide a no-code solution (AppMakr, MobileRoadie) or allow for custom code (Appcelerator, PhoneGap). We exist in the space between the two. Rather than selling to application consumers like other no-code solutions, we are targeting agencies and organizations who wish to provide apps to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>MobileIgniter is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Native - camera, GPS, address book - iOS and Android.</li>\n<li>Fast - build an app for your customer in minutes and update it any time you like without need for AppStore resubmission.</li>\n<li>Inexpensive - monthly subscription for a constantly updated platform vs. large cost for a static application and more cost for improvements.</li>\n<li>Easily Extensible - Build custom functionality using your preferred server side language &amp; industry standard front-end technologies (HTML, JS, CSS).  No need for native coding.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0015/5234/155234v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0015/5234/155234v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,348],"assets/images/resized/0015/5234/155234v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Dominic","last_name":"Dimarco","permalink":"dominic-dimarco","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Business Development and Sales at MobileIgniter","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Menard","permalink":"chris-menard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"Nott","permalink":"timothy-nott","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Pete","last_name":"Johnson","permalink":"pete-johnson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Kunz","permalink":"robert-kunz","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Bizness Apps","permalink":"bizness-apps","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0009/8156/98156v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0009/8156/98156v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0009/8156/98156v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"AppMakr","permalink":"appmakr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-150x150.png"],[[175,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-250x250.png"],[[175,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Appscend","permalink":"appscend","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/6912/146912v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[149,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/6912/146912v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[149,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/6912/146912v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sweb Apps","permalink":"sweb-apps","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/6924/56924v1-max-150x150.png"],[[218,84],"assets/images/resized/0005/6924/56924v1-max-250x250.png"],[[218,84],"assets/images/resized/0005/6924/56924v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ShoutEm","permalink":"shoutem-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0004/9672/49672v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/9672/49672v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,122],"assets/images/resized/0004/9672/49672v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"mobileroadie","permalink":"mobileroadie","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mobile Roadie","permalink":"mobile-roadie","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0004/1979/41979v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0004/1979/41979v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,131],"assets/images/resized/0004/1979/41979v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Madison, WI office","address1":"210 Kedzie Street","address2":"","zip_code":"53704","city":"Madison","state_code":"WI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Boulder, CO office","address1":"4160 Monroe Drive","address2":"Suite C","zip_code":"80303","city":"Boulder","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Sandy City, UT office","address1":"Corporate Parnership Center","address2":"9690 South 300 West","zip_code":"84070","city":"Salt Lake City","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
