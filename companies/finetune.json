Music fans can create their own playlists, listen to pre-made playlists and find other Finetune members with similar music tastes. Users can make playlists with up to 45 songs and they can add songs from other playlists or push the &#8220;I&#8217;m Lazy&#8221; and Finetune will fill the rest of their playlist. Finetune uses their recommendation engine to fill out playlists and suggest new songs.</p>\n\n<p>User can embed their playlists on blogs, websites and MySpace pages via Finetune widgets. They can also listen to Finetune playlists on their Wii or download the Apollo-based desktop music player.  </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Finetune&#8217;s founders Martin Kay and Mykel Ruvola were both involved with Napster. Martin was an early investor through his early-stage technology venture fund NetCapital and Mykel was responsible for Napster&#8217;s web applications and business systems integration. They both went on to start the music service NextRadio together and eventually Finetune. </p>\n\n<p>Competitors include <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/c/pandora\" title=\"Pandora\">Pandora</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/c/last.fm\" title=\"Last.fm\">Last.fm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/radioblogclub\" title=\"RadioBlogClub\">RadioBlogClub</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/0100/100v1-max-150x150.png"],[[155,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/0100/100v1-max-250x250.png"],[[155,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/0100/100v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Finetune","permalink":"finetune","image":null},{"name":"Finetune Desktop","permalink":"finetune-desktop","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Kay","permalink":"martin-kay","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Radio Expert","person":{"first_name":"Barry","last_name":"Scott","permalink":"barry-scott","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Development & Product Lead","person":{"first_name":"Mykel","last_name":"Ruvola","permalink":"mykel-ruvola","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Pandora Media","permalink":"pandora","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-150x150.png"],[[152,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-250x250.png"],[[152,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"finetune","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
