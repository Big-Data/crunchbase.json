I shoot Events, Po trait, and Scenic Photography in Vancouver, B.C. I&#8217;ve been a photographer for 20+ years and only recently decided to try and make a living at it. </p>\n\n<p>I have formal training in photography and can shoot in all types of situations. Low lighting, indoor, outdoor are my specialty. If your going to hire a photographer, hire someone who&#8217;s passionate about it as an art form. It reflects in their work. </p>\n\n<p>I take responsibility for what I shoot. I frame my subjects and consider the environment they are in. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
