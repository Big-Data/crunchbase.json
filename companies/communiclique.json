CommuniClique allows individuals within organizations to TALK, MEET, and SHARE online. CommuniClique is a subscription based application that is accessible over the internet. </p>\n\n<p>CommuniClique is a SaaS team communication tool which provides old school (phone, email) and new school (VoIP, Screen to Screen, IM) communications tools in an easy to use fashion to non-technical teams of people. CommuniClique helps teams communicate more efficiently no matter where they are. </p>\n\n<p>This company is a web based conference bridge that is a proactive dialer that enables users to set up a conference call and call out to everyone on the list.  By dialing out instead of people dialing in no one has to remember the date and time of the conference call.  Another great thing is that no one has to wait for people to join the call as it calls everyone scheduled at the same time.  Also all the calls are recorded therefore anyone that missed the call or missed something during the call they can go back and listen to the call.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,120],"assets/images/resized/0005/5248/55248v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[102,120],"assets/images/resized/0005/5248/55248v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[102,120],"assets/images/resized/0005/5248/55248v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Boice","permalink":"danny-boice","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Powers","permalink":"andy-powers","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$50k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1480773/000148077310000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":20,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Teqcorner","address1":"1616 Anderson Road, Suite 321","address2":"","zip_code":"22102","city":"McLean","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.925502,"longitude":-77.205287}],"milestones":[{"description":"Speek Acquires speak.com Domain ","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":2,"source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/529162/speek-acquires-speak-com-domain-","source_text":"","source_description":"Speek Acquires speak.com Domain ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"CommuniClique","permalink":"communiclique"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.nationaltechcenter.org/index.php/2009/07/20/ipro-communiclique/","title":"A great article about Communiclique"}]}
