Our goal is to provide one place for content downloaders to find and purchase downloable content across a broad range of downloadable content categories. Our speciality is the ability to search for content across a wide range of content categories and find content among those categories that the searcher would not have found using other methods. We serve downloadable content only. If you need a UPS truck to get something, we can&#8217;t help you. If you have credit and want immediate gratification and the content is legally downloable via the internet, we want to be your source. And, we want to do it right away, and easily for you.</p>\n\n<p>We believe we have the LOWEST price for eBooks on the internet. Since our website is totally automated and you download immediately once payment is approved, there is no shipping. If you find lower prices for eBooks on the internet, write us and we&#8217;ll investigate. We want to be the Best Price.</p>\n\n<p>ContentRealtime offers several values to our users:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can search and find downloadable content across multiple categories and suppliers in one easy to use website. (the &#8220;Orbitz&#8221; effect) Simply type a word or phrase into the SEARCH BOX on the home page and hit SEARCH button. We take major credit cards via secure PayPal.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can refer friends and earn money for doing so. You do this by sending a friend an email invitation, either to a specific content item or a general &#8220;please join&#8221;. When they register with ContentRealtime, we will log the fact that YOU referred them, and will track and you will earn a percentage of any amounts they spend through our website. The percentage is small, up to our discretion, and during beta is basically &#8220;Monopoly money&#8221; until we figure out the best way to incent you this way. This amount will be tallied and you can view it at any time under &#8220;your account&#8221;. We reserve the right to forward this amount to you by check or cash, offset future purchases, or find other ways to give you the value you earned by referring friends. (the &#8220;make money referring my friends to this site effect&#8212;aka Amway MLM effect). Simply INVITE a friend in the lower left portion of any webpage. Once they are invited and accept your invitation, we record that and track earnings for you, look on MY PROFILE on your account page to see this.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can upload your own downloable content to our site, and offer it for sale. We split the proceeds of any sale with you 50/50. You MUST own the content you are uploading (either you created the content yourself, OR, you must have both the &#8220;I own&#8221; and the &#8220;I can sell this downloadable content without any restraints or copyright issues or issues where someone else has an entitlement to either content or the value transaction you are creating by selling it via ContentRealtime&#8221;) (the &#8220;eBay&#8221; effect). Just UPLOAD any original content that you own and have the rights to sell and set a price for it. We track the sale, the fact that it is yours and send you 50 percent of the income once received from a fellow downloader. Hit the &#8220;UPLOAD content&#8221; box next to search or visit the YouContent category.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can vote on content (use the star system) and you can comment and form communities here around the content you like. The FORUM link for community comments is on the lower right side of the main page. (the &#8220;social&#8221; effect). Go to the FORUM choice in the lower right of the screen, contribute to one of the already started FORUM topics or create your own. Also, you can VOTE on any content item when you are viewing the detail page about that content. Voting and buying content moves that content UP on the most popular and most recent tabs so others will benefit from your interests. FORUM topics can be a single content item (put the node link from that content item HINT: this means copy the browser address of the particular content item you are blogging about into your FORUM post and title the FORUM TOPIC so other users will find your comment and comment on your comment. We appreciate your interests.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks for your patronage and input to make this site more useful.
