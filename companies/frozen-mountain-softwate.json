WebSync allows users to push data, in real-time, over the Web without requiring plug-ins, security changes or dedicated servers. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike other Comet servers, WebSync is built for Microsoftâ€™s IIS Web server, using Microsoftâ€™s .NET platform, making it fully compatible with Microsoft technology. </p>\n\n<p>Also, it does not require additional servers, ports or extensive configuration like traditional Comet/Reverse Ajax solutions. Keeping in mind that traditional Comet servers have a large learning curve, WebSync was designed to be intuitive, and easy to use. It is currently used for live chat, streaming stock data, live auctions, real-time monitoring, news updates and a variety of other applications.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0007/5654/75654v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/5654/75654v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/5654/75654v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Jerod","last_name":"Venema","permalink":"jerod-venema","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Anton","last_name":"Venema","permalink":"anton-venema","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"StreamHub","permalink":"streamhub","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Jetty","permalink":"jetty","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Weswit","permalink":"lightstreamer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/6579/76579v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0007/6579/76579v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,147],"assets/images/resized/0007/6579/76579v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://ajaxian.com/archives/websync-comet-for-iis","title":"Ajaxian Article about WebSync"},{"external_url":"http://cometdaily.com/2009/11/14/comet-support-for-iis/","title":"CometDaily Article"}]}
