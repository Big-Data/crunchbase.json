As recently launched one-stop market place for acquiring Games &amp; Apps licenses, GameCot claims to provide the most profitable deals to both developers and publishers. </p>\n\n<p>On GameCot developers can showcase and sell the licenses of their games and applications for as many as 21 platforms. Through GameCot, developers can also avail funding to develop and publish their ideas. </p>\n\n<p>For all these, developers just need to submit description, images &amp; videos of their games and apps. Rest all activities like promotions, hunt for publishers, effective and timely assistance on every small aspect of the deal etc. would be taken care of by GameCot. As GameCot doesnâ€™t ask developers to upload Games and Apps installers and only the trusted and registered publishers are allowed to view the content, it almost effectively protects the IP rights of developers. And the best part is, developers themselves get to decide licensing price for their products.</p>\n\n<p>In current market conditions where it is very difficult for publishers to setup a company with multiple development teams to publish Games and Applications on various platforms, GameCot seems to be the only effective remedy, With quick and reliable services GameCot claims to offer plenty of high quality Games and Applications to publishers. Publishers can now build an attractive catalogue in short span and also avoid risk, save time &amp; money in acquiring Games &amp; Apps licenses for 21 platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The founder of GameCot, Vijay Sharma, who has got a numbers of achievements in Games and Apps industry said, â€œThrough GameCot I want to help creativity find the right commercial value. And as a first sign of success, not only considerable number of developers joined us in short span, but also some really big publishers from Silicon Valley and mobile manufacturers from Korea have registered on GameCot.â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0010/3062/103062v2-max-150x150.png"],[[240,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/3062/103062v2-max-250x250.png"],[[240,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/3062/103062v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
