Together, it&#8217;s how they build on the billions of R&amp;D search investments made by the search industry as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>No single search engine covers the entire Internet. Different engines use different technologies and thus draw different results from the vast pool of available information. The metasearch-driven searches cover more of the Internet because they combine the most relevant returns from multiple search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Ask, and Bing.</p>\n\n<p>InfoSpace&#8217;s metasearch technology provides users with the &#8220;best of the bestâ€ results each time they search. InfoSpace metasearch helps advertisers achieve a much higher match rate than any other search engine and delivers more sponsored listings per commercial search. Sites hosting metasearch receive a higher pay-per-click rate, which is a key selling point when InfoSpace engages with potential private-label search customers.\nMajor search engines can benefit by building their networks through InfoSpace metasearch sites and through the private-label search solutions they create for customers who want to offer a preferred search resource under their own brand.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rich","last_name":"Sorkin","permalink":"rich-sorkin","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Elon","last_name":"Musk","permalink":"elon-musk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/5849/25849v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0002/5849/25849v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,232],"assets/images/resized/0002/5849/25849v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elon<em>Musk</em>in<em>Mission</em>Control_at_SpaceX.jpg</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Finance and Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"McVay","permalink":"ken-mcvay","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Kimbal","last_name":"Musk","permalink":"kimbal-musk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0004/6217/46217v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,244],"assets/images/resized/0004/6217/46217v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,292],"assets/images/resized/0004/6217/46217v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>lauriesmithphoto.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Manager, Sales and Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Efrusy","permalink":"kevin-efrusy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0616/10616v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0616/10616v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[210,315],"assets/images/resized/0001/0616/10616v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director, Sales","person":{"first_name":"Owen","last_name":"Van Natta","permalink":"owen-van-natta","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0694/10694v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0694/10694v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0694/10694v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>photoues</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":307000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://news.cnet.com/Compaq-buys-Zip2/2100-1023_3-221675.html","source_description":"Compaq buys Zip2","acquired_year":1999,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":null,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Compaq","permalink":"compaq","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/8648/48648v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[226,53],"assets/images/resized/0004/8648/48648v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[226,53],"assets/images/resized/0004/8648/48648v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
