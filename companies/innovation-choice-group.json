Currently, those fields mainly use a &#8220;scientific journal-only&#8221; approach to solve issues and Innovation Choice Group believes that this method is not the best way to go about this process. Data can be outdated, difficult to access, unavailable for free or not exactly relevant to the question at hand. Instead, ICG will allow users to access the portal in order to directly interact with experts who can provide approaches and/or a detailed explanation of how to tackle your question.</p>\n\n<p>In esence, we seek to change the way people do medical/scientific research; paper-based approaches will not end any time soon, but with ICG&#8217;s portal, scientists all over the world can access an &#8220;expert crowd-sourced community&#8221; which dynamically adapts to the user&#8217;s needs and facilitates innovation in the most efficient fashion. And unlike our competitors, we actually verify/vet registered users who want to bid answers to the scientific questions. In this way, complete transparency is assured and scientists will be more eager to participate in our portal.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0017/6039/176039v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0017/6039/176039v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[444,223],"assets/images/resized/0017/6039/176039v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Arauz","permalink":"robert-arauz","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Executive Advisor","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Barnett","permalink":"george-barnett","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Fain","permalink":"christopher-fain","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ResearchGate","permalink":"researchgate","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/1765/31765v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0003/1765/31765v4-max-250x250.png"],[[260,96],"assets/images/resized/0003/1765/31765v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Academia","permalink":"academia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/0937/150937v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[222,89],"assets/images/resized/0015/0937/150937v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[222,89],"assets/images/resized/0015/0937/150937v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal Firm","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Jason Kuhns","permalink":"jason-kuhns","image":null}},{"title":"Designer","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Brooke Miller Design","permalink":"brooke-miller-design","image":null}},{"title":"Software Developer","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Artyllect Consulting","permalink":"artyllect-consulting","image":null}},{"title":"CPA","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Bayardo Rivera","permalink":"bayardo-rivera","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Innovation Choice Group","address1":"660 4th Street. #513","address2":"","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Won scholarship to participate at DEMO Fall 2012","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":2,"source_url":"http://www.demo.com/ehome/34444/DEMOFall2012/overview","source_text":null,"source_description":"Demo Fall 2012","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Innovation Choice Group","permalink":"innovation-choice-group"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/6038/176038v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[228,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/6038/176038v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[410,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/6038/176038v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.innovationchoice.com/InnovationChoiceGroup/Welcome.html","title":"Placeholder Site"}]}
