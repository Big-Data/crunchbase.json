As a marketing ploy, the company permits free calls to other members.\n-Jaxtr uses cafe jaxtr, a social network in which people call one another to discuss similar interests, and free global SMS to attract activity on its website and generate advertising revenue.</p>\n\n<p>The company maintains an advantage over competitors such as <a href=\"www.skype.com\" title=\"Skype\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skype</a> by allowing customers to use any phone - mobile or landline - without the need to download software or maintain Internet access, and calling cards by eliminating the need to dial additional numbers and PIN codes.
