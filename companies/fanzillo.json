It turns watching, listening, and rating music into a game where you are rewarded based on how good of a critic you are and how well you know the public reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Friends kept complaining about existing websites trying to cater to amateur musicians. The sites were either boring, poorly laid out, or didn&#8217;t give the artists a fair chance to be heard. </p>\n\n<p>Fanzillo set out to do something different. Creating great music takes talent. Being able to spot great music also takes talent. Yet, there is no site out there that offers amateur artists a fair chance to stand out, and that rewards great critics who find those great artists. Moreover, there is no site that has been able to accomplish this and make it fun. </p>\n\n<p>Through a unique rating game that makes it enjoyable to rate randomly selected videos within a given music preference, Fanzillo creates a system where ratings truly matter and where everyone has a fair opportunity to be heard. </p>\n\n<p>Fanzilloâ€™s goal is to provide a truly unique, fun, and social experience for people to discover great talent and share those discoveries.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0015/9985/159985v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0015/9985/159985v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0015/9985/159985v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Spoor","permalink":"dan-spoor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1504/161504v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[152,152],"assets/images/resized/0016/1504/161504v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[152,152],"assets/images/resized/0016/1504/161504v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"40 Coventry Lane","address2":"","zip_code":"13903","city":"Binghamton","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0015/7286/157286v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0015/7286/157286v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0015/7286/157286v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
