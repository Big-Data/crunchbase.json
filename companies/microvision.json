","email_address":"info@microvision.com","phone_number":"(425) 936-6847 ","description":"Ultra-miniature laser display technology","created_at":"Mon Jun 22 18:53:36 UTC 2009","updated_at":"Wed Sep 14 02:49:19 UTC 2011","overview":"<p>MicroVision offers the PicoPÂ® laser display engine to power next-generation display and imaging products for pico projectors, vehicle displays and wearable displays that interface with mobile devices. As the worldâ€™s first commercial ultra-miniature laser-scanning technology, PicoP uses highly efficient laser light sources to display vivid widescreen images with high contrast and brightness up to and over 8 feet diagonally  in size.</p>\n\n<p>MicroVisionâ€™s products address the unmet need facing growing mobility marketsâ€“consumers want a far bigger viewing experience than they currently get from small mobile device displays. Considering the growth of YouTube, flip video cameras and Apple devices, consumers themselves are increasingly the content creators, and sharing those creations in the real-world has meant squinting and huddling around a small screen. The PicoP laser display engine is small and low power enough to be embedded directly into devices such as smartphones, media players, camcorders and tablets. MicroVision is collaborating with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the telecommunications, gaming and consumer electronics markets to create new experiences that free consumers from the small screen in addition to creating new opportunities for carriers, content producers and brand marketers.</p>\n\n<p>In vertical markets, such as automotive, aviation, medical and defense, there is strong demand for innovative display and imaging products that overcome todayâ€™s limitations. For example, the PicoP laser display engine can be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone aftermarket device to create a head-up display (HUD), placing critical information directly on the windshield of an automobile or into see-through eyewear displays. MicroVision is working closely with various automotive suppliers including Pioneer, which is targeting commercial introduction of an in-vehicle HUD using PicoP technology for the consumer market in 2012. The company has also entered into contracts with commercial and government customers to develop high-definition, see-through eyewear displays.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0005/0180/50180v3-max-150x150.png"],[[151,84],"assets/images/resized/0005/0180/50180v3-max-250x250.png"],[[151,84],"assets/images/resized/0005/0180/50180v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SHOWWX","permalink":"showwx","image":null},{"name":"SHOWWX+","permalink":"showwx-2","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Tokman","permalink":"alex-tokman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"T.
