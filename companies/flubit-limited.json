You take it - right?</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what Flubit does: creates better offers for people on things they’ve decided to buy.</p>\n\n<p>Flubit is a new, demand-driven marketplace that turns online shopping upside down. We’ve created a platform for users to demand the exact products they need and want, and we create a unique offer just for them through our nation-wide registry of retailers. </p>\n\n<p>We believe in consumer emancipation. We don’t believe in stuffing inboxes with offer after offer for products people don’t want - we believe in creating real offers for things they’ve already decided to buy.</p>\n\n<p>We also don’t believe in crushing retailers with 50 or 80 per cent commissions.</p>\n\n<p>By abandoning the traditional commission-based model and replacing it with a 21st-Century approach, Flubit delivers real online sales to retailers and real offers to online shoppers at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>We let our users voice their demands, and turn those demands into sales for our retailers. </p>\n\n<p>Launched by Bertie Stephens and Adel Louertatani in April 2011 as the world&#8217;s first true demand-driven marketplace, Flubit.com is set to re-launch in September 2012. </p>\n\n<p>With offices just off Hoxton Square in London, Flubit is backed by a group of private investors including Patrick Perez, former CEO &amp; Chairman of Neuron Data/Blaze Software and Erik Fullstrom as an advisor and seasoned technology start-up investor.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/0536/150536v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/0536/150536v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/0536/150536v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bertie","last_name":"Stephens","permalink":"bertie-stephens","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5777/155777v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[212,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5777/155777v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[383,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/5777/155777v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Communications
