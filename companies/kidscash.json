It is safe, easy and fun. It educates kids of all ages about saving and spending, and lets them purchase goods online independently, without the need of an adult payment option.</p>\n\n<p>Online shopping experience is changing dramatically with the introduction of online goods and virtual goods. The dependency on the adult payment option is bothering both parents and\nchildren. Many online stores are losing customers because “Children don’t click the add to cart button”.</p>\n\n<p>With KidsCash, children can easily and securely shop online. Parents can rest assure and not be bothered with the child every whim, and still be fully involved with their behavior online.\nMerchants can integrate a “Pay with KidsCash” button in their sites in 2 minutes and get new customers and sales instantly. In the process children learn in a safe, controlled environment,\nhow to be money-wise.</p>\n\n<p>KidsCash beats other payment methods by providing a simple solution for kids while supporting\na line of values that exists in KidsCash alone.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0016/7765/167765v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0016/7765/167765v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0016/7765/167765v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, VP Biz Dev","person":{"first_name":"Yossi","last_name":"Dan","permalink":"yossi-dan-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Erez","last_name":"R.
