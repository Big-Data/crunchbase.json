Since its inception, the company has already gained recognition as a technology leader and initiated deals with world leaders as Yahoo, TIS, Kodak, NEC, NDS, PTC and more.</p>\n\n<p>Infima NCMâ€™s significant advantages making it the cutting edge of compression technologies:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Highest Compression ratio!</li>\n<li>Highest Acceleration in Data retrieval!</li>\n<li>Best advantage in Lossless Compression. Bit-to-Bit retrieval.</li>\n<li>No dependency on Data type. Bit level compression, able to compress wide array of data including â€œHard to Crackâ€ formats as JPEG, MP3, MPEG4 and PDF.</li>\n<li>Able to re-compress already compressed material!ã€€(Since it is working on a new and different approach, not like most other compression technologies on the market)</li>\n<li>Able to compress to standard formats like JPEG, etc. in much higher speed than alternatives! (Although best performance is achieved with Infimaâ€™s  format).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Infimaâ€™s revolutionary compression technology is based on a Neural Network based patented algorithm, developed by leading experts in applied mathematics and can be seamlessly integrated into existing applications and appliances (literally any application as: Medical Imaging, Document imaging, Video, Storage, Network optimization and more) to achieve excellent compression ratios and acceleration of up to 3 times better than currently used technologies. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/6591/26591v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0002/6591/26591v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[438,239],"assets/images/resized/0002/6591/26591v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"general compression SDK","permalink":"general-compression-sdk","image":null},{"name":"Image Compression SDK","permalink":"image-compression-sdk","image":null},{"name":"Medical Image Compression SDK","permalink":"medical-image-compression-sdk","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Shy","last_name":"Zyman","permalink":"shy-zyman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Nir","last_name":"Halwani","permalink":"nir-halwani","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing & Sales","person":{"first_name":"Avshalom","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"avshalom-cohen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP R&D","person":{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"Demidov","permalink":"lilia-demidov","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Lead Technologies","permalink":"lead-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0008/8137/88137v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0008/8137/88137v1-max-250x250.png"],[[392,67],"assets/images/resized/0008/8137/88137v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Lizardtech","permalink":"lizardtech","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0008/8289/88289v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[177,54],"assets/images/resized/0008/8289/88289v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[177,54],"assets/images/resized/0008/8289/88289v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Xceed","permalink":"xceed","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,65],"assets/images/resized/0004/1549/41549v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,65],"assets/images/resized/0004/1549/41549v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,65],"assets/images/resized/0004/1549/41549v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Accounting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"PricewaterhouseCoopers","permalink":"pricewaterhousecoopers","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0005/6948/56948v1-max-150x150.png"],[[244,48],"assets/images/resized/0005/6948/56948v1-max-250x250.png"],[[244,48],"assets/images/resized/0005/6948/56948v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"title":"Law Firm ","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Yigal Arnon & Co ","permalink":"yigal-arnon-co","image":null}},{"title":"Investment Banking ","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"YAM Business Opportunities LTD ","permalink":"yam-business-opportunities-ltd","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$630k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"first investment","raised_amount":380000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":26,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"second investment","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":20,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Infima offices","address1":"Shenkar 16","address2":"","zip_code":"12150","city":"Herzelia","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.openpr.com/news/22678/Infima-Technologies-Announces-world-first-JPEG2000-lossless-compression.html","title":"Jpeg2000 Compression"}]}
