Cloudant was born out of the foundersâ€™ collective frustration with the tools available. In early 2008 their ideas for fixing the â€˜big data problemâ€™ caught the attention of Y-Combinator.\nThe Service</p>\n\n<p>Cloudant is a non-relational, zero-configuration, distributed database service based on Apache CouchDB. Cloudant takes full advantage of the cloud platform, automatically distributing data across multiple servers and seamlessly scaling the database to accommodate the needs of any application. Cloudant provides the simplicity web developers want with the power to store and analyze the ever-increasing data volumes web applications need.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/4390/4390v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/4390/4390v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0000/4390/4390v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & President","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Hoffman","permalink":"alan-hoffman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Kocoloski","permalink":"adam-kocoloski","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Miller","permalink":"michael-miller","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Schoettle","permalink":"derek-schoettle","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Independent BOD Member","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Palmer","permalink":"andy-palmer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/5825/25825v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[149,199],"assets/images/resized/0002/5825/25825v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[149,199],"assets/images/resized/0002/5825/25825v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3.02M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":15000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Y Combinator","permalink":"y-combinator","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/3181/13181v9-max-150x150.png"],[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/3181/13181v9-max-250x250.png"],[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/3181/13181v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/12/12/daily49-Cloudant-claims-2M-funding.html","source_description":"Cloudant claims $2M funding","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":16,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"580 Harrison Ave","address2":"Suite 402","zip_code":"02118","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.35892,"longitude":-71.05781}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
