Grooveshark offers users the option to access their Grooveshark accounts remotely with mobile applications for Android, jailbroken iOS, BlackBerry, and HP Palm WebOS devices.</p>\n\n<p>Grooveshark also allows artists and record labels to promote themselves through the application with rich site takeovers, advertising based on a slew of targeting and demographic data, and getting their music straight to the ears of the music fans most likely to love it. All data and analytics relating to an artist (or group of artists) are freely available to promoters and bands, such as the number of times their content has been listened to, along with demographic and geographic information about the listeners.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0001/3121/13121v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,222],"assets/images/resized/0001/3121/13121v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,400],"assets/images/resized/0001/3121/13121v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Tarantino","permalink":"sam-tarantino","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4801/64801v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4801/64801v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4801/64801v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Grooveshark.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Greenberg","permalink":"josh-greenberg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4803/64803v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4803/64803v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4803/64803v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Grooveshark.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & COO","person":{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"Barreto","permalink":"andres-barreto","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/2119/42119v2-max-150x150.png"],[[143,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/2119/42119v2-max-250x250.png"],[[143,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/2119/42119v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Wm.
