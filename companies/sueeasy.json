With over 1 Million hits in its first month and a steady rate of 800,000 hits each month, SueEasy has resolved a wide variety of legal problems for the North American population. At the same time, itâ€™s also a paid, membership based, â€œClient Directory For Lawyers&#8230;â€ as described by the Wall Street Journal recently. </p>\n\n<p>Customer Problem: Currently, people seeking good legal help are forced to make confusing online searches, scramble through Yellow Pages, make frantic phone calls or ask somebody for referrals. SueEasy solves this problem by being a &#8220;..Matchmaker For Would-Be Plaintiffs&#8221;(ABA Journal â€“ American Bar Association). </p>\n\n<p>Product/Services: People with legal problems, mainly potential Class Actions can file their case and then VIRALLY spread the user-generated page on 72 of the hottest Social Networks &amp; Bookmarking sites such as Facebook, Digg, MySpace etc. This is consumer activism at a whole new level, giving people the power to fight corporate wrongdoing and keep checks &amp; balances. Complaints received range from deaths resulting from FDA recalled drugs to bad gaskets from a major automobile company to unfair NSF/overdraft charges from certain US. Banks. Interested attorneys contact potential litigants for Class Action, personal injury and 62 other types of cases, thus creating a transparent, streamlined and efficient process. </p>\n\n<p>Market Trends: Lawyers spend roughly $4.5 billion on advertising. Most of that occurs in traditional media, with $1.3 billion going to print ads in Yellow Pages. They have gone the way of the dinosaurs. We feel these are wasted marketing dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Sales/Marketing Strategy: For the litigants, SueEasy aims to be a name synonymous with â€˜legal helpâ€™ and the first place they turn to. Successful viral marketing (10 YouTube ads created by the founders), PR are already in place using founders contacts; (trade publications, journals, TV &amp; Radio spots planned). </p>\n\n<p>Competitive Advantage: SueEasy is a pioneer in bringing Web 2.0 &amp; litigation together, thus creating massive lead generation for attorneys.
