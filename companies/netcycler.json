Netcycler&#8217;s unique technology makes it easy to get what you want by swapping things you donâ€™t need anymore. For most people the value of their material possessions is much higher than the balance of their bank account. The more you swap, the more money you save for those few things that swapping cannot get you. Money has served humanity well, but now netcycler lets you swap, give away and trade pre-owned items in a much smarter way. And be gentler with the environment at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Netcycler is a consumer Internet service for trading pre-owned items. The service is available in the UK, Germany and Finland. The usage of the service is growing rapidly, and Netcycler has more than 110 000 registered users. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/6507/66507v3-max-150x150.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/6507/66507v3-max-250x250.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/6507/66507v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"netcycler.fi","permalink":"netcycler-fi","image":null},{"name":"netcycler.de","permalink":"netcycler-de","image":null},{"name":"netcycler.co.uk","permalink":"netcycler-co-uk","image":null},{"name":"www.swap.com","permalink":"www-swap-com","image":null},{"name":"valet.swap.com","permalink":"valet-swap-com","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.arcticstartup.com/2010/11/16/netcycler-closes-725ke-round-expands-to-germany","source_description":"ArcticStartup","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Ruoholahdenkatu 10","address2":"","zip_code":"00180","city":"Helsinki","state_code":null,"country_code":"FIN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Netcycler Inc.","address1":"715 Racquet Club Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"60101","city":"Addison","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0013/4767/134767v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,198],"assets/images/resized/0013/4767/134767v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,356],"assets/images/resized/0013/4767/134767v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/8790/218790v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0021/8790/218790v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0021/8790/218790v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/8791/218791v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0021/8791/218791v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0021/8791/218791v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://tane.li/2010/netcycler-swap-your-secondhand-stuff-powerful-matchmaking","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/swapping-scheme-with-a-twist-due-to-arrive-in-the-uk-2143328.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.arcticstartup.com/2010/11/16/netcycler-closes-725ke-round-expands-to-germany","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/juha-koponen/collaborative-consumption_b_1003315.html","title":"Collaborative Consumption - Bringing Swapping Online"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/18/netcycler-swaps-an-old-idea-for-a-slightly-better-one/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/11/02/finnish-online-item-swapping-startup-netcycler-acquires-swap-com-debuts-valet-service/","title":""}]}
