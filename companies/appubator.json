That&#8217;s the reason the founders created appubator (short for Mobile Application Incubator). appubator works with the general public to design, develop and launch their ideas for new mobile applications. We help make people&#8217;s dreams become a reality.</p>\n\n<p>appubator has already developed a number of mobile apps for iPhone, Android and Windows Mobile. Through that experience, the company knows what it takes to develop a great application and to get distribution in the major online marketplaces.</p>\n\n<p>The public submits its ideas through the company&#8217;s website or online apps. Once an idea has been approved, appubator will invest the money and resources on the software development and marketing and share 30% of the revenues back with the submitter. appubator takes all the risk and creates income opportunities for people who share their great ideas. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6261/76261v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0007/6261/76261v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,100],"assets/images/resized/0007/6261/76261v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Laney","last_name":"Dale","permalink":"laney-dale","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Chip","last_name":"Royce","permalink":"charles-chip-royce","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"1202 Raleigh Road","address2":"","zip_code":"27517","city":"Chapel Hill","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0007/7609/77609v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,207],"assets/images/resized/0007/7609/77609v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0007/7609/77609v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
