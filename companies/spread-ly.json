It enables users after a one-time authentification, to share feedback, simultaneously if desired, on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and GoogleBuzz with just one click. Before sending the â€œlikesâ€ can be commented on.</p>\n\n<p>Web site operators profit from the recommend-tool, as their content is spread into different social media channels by their visitors where it can be seen by their contact network.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Spreadly is an analysis tool that helps web site operators to evaluate the effectiveness of usersâ€™ recommendations. Anonymized demographic data are visible to the web site operator. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the button offers the possibility to create individual â€œdealsâ€ for an individually defined running period. That way site operators can reward users for their recommendations with individual discounts, bonuses and other benefits \nIn April 2010 the button was already launched under the name yiid.it. The relaunch and product extension under the name Spread.ly took place in March 2011. The button is a service of ekaabo GmbH (www.ekaabo.de), one of the leading providers of community innovations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0012/6984/126984v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0012/6984/126984v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,265],"assets/images/resized/0012/6984/126984v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Ripanti","permalink":"marco-ripanti","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/3650/33650v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/3650/33650v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,412],"assets/images/resized/0003/3650/33650v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"Pfefferle","permalink":"matthias-pfefferle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/6019/56019v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0005/6019/56019v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0005/6019/56019v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Matthias Pfefferle</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ShareThis","permalink":"sharethis","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/5706/15706v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/5706/15706v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/5706/15706v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Spreadly HQ","address1":"Schulstrasse 8","address2":"","zip_code":"69469","city":"Weinheim","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launch of our social sharing Ad-Network","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://blog.spreadly.com/2011/09/13/besser-als-banner-werbung-nach-dem-like","source_text":null,"source_description":"Launch of the first social sharing Ad-Network (German)","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Spreadly","permalink":"spread-ly"}},{"description":"Launch of our DEAL - API","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":31,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"Spread Deals via our API","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Spreadly","permalink":"spread-ly"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0012/6981/126981v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0012/6981/126981v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,449],"assets/images/resized/0012/6981/126981v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/6982/126982v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0012/6982/126982v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0012/6982/126982v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[118,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/6983/126983v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/6983/126983v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[354,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/6983/126983v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
