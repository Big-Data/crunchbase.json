The value proposition of the service is to be available for\nrelevant calls and message while preventing disturbing phone calls and\nmessages when your attention is needed elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of the service is an â€œactive inboxâ€ with a Semantic\nPresence engine that decides how relevant incoming phone calls and\nmessages are for the user at any given time.</p>\n\n<p>An integral part of the service offering is the ReachCard, which is the\ncentral point of the users different social contexts and is used for\ninitiating communication with the user. It is a web based point of contact\nthat has a unique URL that can be shared and communicated and each\nReachCard comes with Internet Communication services built-in, such as\nE-Mail, SMS and Voice over IP and traditional phone numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The service works much like a proxy that sits in between the userâ€™s\ndifferent points of contact, and their personal communication tool or device (e-mail client, IM-client,\nmobile phone etc).</p>\n\n<p>GlocalReach is essentially offering the ability to manage and prioritize interruptions, and to be reachable, but not disturbed.</p>\n\n<p>All products are delivered as a service over the Internet, with-no requirements to install software or hardware, but will offer add-ons such as mobile applications.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/1416/21416v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0002/1416/21416v2-max-250x250.png"],[[439,262],"assets/images/resized/0002/1416/21416v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Starck","permalink":"erik-starck","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Nicolai","last_name":"Wadstrom","permalink":"nicolai-wadstrom-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,139],"assets/images/resized/0002/4175/24175v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,167],"assets/images/resized/0002/4175/24175v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,167],"assets/images/resized/0002/4175/24175v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"GrandCentral ","permalink":"grandcentral","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/0445/445v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/0445/445v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/0445/445v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Business development","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"BootstrapLabs","permalink":"bootstraplabs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/4966/24966v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/4966/24966v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/4966/24966v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$200k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Founders/Angels","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":null,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"27 Old Gloucester Street","address2":"","zip_code":"WC1N 3XX","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5208247,"longitude":-0.1219851}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
