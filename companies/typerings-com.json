The company combines traditional craftsmanship with the desire of today&#8217;s consumer for personalization. In a â€œNikeID-likeâ€ environment, visitors can type a text, choose from eight divergent typefaces or upload their own design. The rings appear on screen, showing the designs in full 3D. Typerings.com delivers personalized DIY rings in over 30 countries.</p>\n\n<p>The website is part of Alphabeth Group, an Amsterdam based start-up. They&#8217;re  planning to further develop the current website by adding Asian and Arabic typefaces, introducing gems and diamonds, creating a new &#8216;premium&#8217; jewelry brand, other &#8216;niche&#8217; websites, an iPad/Android tablet app and an innovative retail concept. All based on the platform, developed for Typerings.com.</p>\n\n<p>Next to developing new concepts, the company wants to focus on sustainability, switching to using solely recycled silver and gold and starting a project with a small mining facility abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Sustainable trend\nCustomization is one of the main consumers trends. Advances in technology and the desire for personalized products is driving a huge surge in the number of customizable products available. When given the choice, consumers are sure to enjoy self-created pieces that they can truly call their own.</p>\n\n<p>Launched in 1999, Nike iD is still the best example of online customization. Nike ID allows people to engage in creative expression with a concept that is easy to understand, fun to work with and can simply be shared with friends. A quick online scan shows a lot has happened since then: Customized Jeans, Bicycles, Shoes, Books, Sneakers, Puzzles, Handbags, iPhone covers, even Beer bottles can be personalized.</p>\n\n<p>While Jewelry in itself is extremely personal, there wasn&#8217;t a &#8216;NikeiD for jewelry&#8217;. Founder and Angel investor Rik Heijmen explains why: &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to know the Industry as extremely fashionable and trend-sensitive on the one hand, but innovation-lacking and tech-phobic on the other hand&#8221;, Rik Heijmen explains. Because of his advertising background, his ideas have a fresh approach in an Industry that has barely noticed the internet revolution: &#8220;We are now combining traditional craftsmanship with the desire of today&#8217;s consumer for personalization in Typerings.com.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, founder","person":{"first_name":"Rik","last_name":"Heijmen","permalink":"rik-heijmen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rik Heijmen / <a href=\"http://www.alphabeth.com\" title=\"Alphabeth Group\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alphabeth Group</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Zales.com","permalink":"zales-com","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Brilliant Earth","permalink":"brilliant-earth","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0015/3028/153028v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0015/3028/153028v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[323,77],"assets/images/resized/0015/3028/153028v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sorella","permalink":"sorella","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$200k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Rik","last_name":"Heijmen","permalink":"rik-heijmen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rik Heijmen / <a href=\"http://www.alphabeth.com\" title=\"Alphabeth Group\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alphabeth Group</a></p>"}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Amsterdam","address1":"Van Ostadestraat 115-sous","address2":"","zip_code":"1072SV","city":"Amsterdam","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/P2sX1FrT0k0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>The Ring designer in detail</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[87,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0753/140753v2-max-150x150.png"],[[145,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0753/140753v2-max-250x250.png"],[[261,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0753/140753v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://design-milk.com/typerings-and-giveaway/","title":"Design Milk - Design blog"},{"external_url":"http://springwi.se/jHFNRs","title":"Springwise - Inspiring Business Ideas"}]}
