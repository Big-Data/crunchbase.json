Austhink develops software supporting critical thinking and decision making, in both business and education. In its software, it uses argument mapping, the use of graphical techniques for handling complex argumentation.  Argument mapping has been shown in extensive research to be very effective in building critical thinking skills.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6820/16820v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6820/16820v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6820/16820v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"bCisive","permalink":"bcisive","image":null},{"name":"bCisive by Austhink Software","permalink":"bcisive-by-austhink-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/7040/17040v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,73],"assets/images/resized/0001/7040/17040v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,73],"assets/images/resized/0001/7040/17040v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Prager","permalink":"daniel-prager","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"van Gelder","permalink":"tim-van-gelder","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3.77M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":3770000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Starfish Ventures","permalink":"starfish-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0003/2990/32990v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/2990/32990v1-max-250x250.png"],[[291,85],"assets/images/resized/0003/2990/32990v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":" 1/90 William St","address2":"","zip_code":"3000","city":"Melbourne Vic","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":-37.813603,"longitude":144.96616}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0008/2901/82901v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,207],"assets/images/resized/0008/2901/82901v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0008/2901/82901v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bCisive.austhink.com","title":"bCisive"},{"external_url":"http://rationale.austhink.com","title":"Rationale"},{"external_url":"http://austhink.com/consulting","title":"Austhink Consulting"}]}
