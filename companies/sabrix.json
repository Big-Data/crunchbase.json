The Sabrix Application Suite serves global enterprises such as Amazon.com, BASF, Cisco, DTE Energy, IBM, QUALCOMM, Sportsmanâ€™s Warehouse, and York International. The Sabrix Application Suite seamlessly connects to all financial applications requiring the determination, calculation, and recording of transaction taxes. The company also offers the Sabrix Managed Tax Serviceâ„¢ (MTS), an outsourced transaction tax compliance service that helps finance departments of small-and-medium-sized businesses eliminate the hassle, control their audit exposure, and reduce the total cost of sales tax, use tax, and VAT compliance. Sabrix MTS seamlessly integrates with a companyâ€™s existing accounting and e-commerce systems, and, similar to outsourced payroll services, operates as a trusted extension of a companyâ€™s finance department to address tax compliance from start to finish: address validation, tax rate maintenance, tax determination and calculation, returns preparation and filing as well as audit research and documentation.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/7102/67102v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/7102/67102v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[157,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/7102/67102v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Board","person":{"first_name":"Joanna","last_name":"Rees","permalink":"joanna-rees","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0001/5284/15284v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0001/5284/15284v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0001/5284/15284v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.fon.com</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"McAdam","permalink":"tim-mcadam","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Director, Sales","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Sardella","permalink":"ben-sardella","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1999/141999v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/1999/141999v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/1999/141999v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$13M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.sabrix.com/2006/06/sabrix-secures-13-million-in-series-d-funding/","source_description":" Sabrix Secures $13 Million in Series D Funding ","raised_amount":13000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"GKM","permalink":"gkm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/9081/29081v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/9081/29081v1-max-250x250.png"],[[411,93],"assets/images/resized/0002/9081/29081v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mohr Davidow Ventures","permalink":"mohr-davidow-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/9292/19292v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0001/9292/19292v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,176],"assets/images/resized/0001/9292/19292v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"VSP Capital","permalink":"vsp-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/9911/29911v1-max-150x150.png"],[[107,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/9911/29911v1-max-250x250.png"],[[107,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/9911/29911v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Trinity Ventures","permalink":"trinity-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/9369/19369v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/9369/19369v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/9369/19369v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"5665 SW Meadows Rd","address2":"Suite 400","zip_code":"97035","city":"Lake Oswego","state_code":"OR","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0006/7103/67103v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,203],"assets/images/resized/0006/7103/67103v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,365],"assets/images/resized/0006/7103/67103v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
