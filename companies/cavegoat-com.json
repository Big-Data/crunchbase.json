Cavegoat.com is the newest place to buy and sell goods and services. The site is set up in a format which allows users to browse ads by category then narrow their search by geographic location. Users can browse and post ads for free in 600 cities within 78 countries. Cavegoat.com was conceived and built by a Stanford Alumni electrical engineer to address the lack of a world-wide forum for advertising and discussions.</p>\n\n<p>As a global free local classified ads site, Cavegoat.com enables parties to browse and post ads in categories such as Autos, Pets, Housing, Services, Community, Jobs, For Sale,  and Personals. As a discussions site, Cavegoat.com enables parties to engage in discussions on forum topics submitted by other parties. </p>\n\n<p>The website does not require any registration to post ads. There is no limit on the number of ads that can be posted and all ads are set to be active on the site for a minimum of sixty days. Placing an ad can be accomplished in three easy steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click on â€œPost to classifieds for freeâ€ and select the category.</li>\n<li>Fill in each drop down box.</li>\n<li>Click on submit.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re done. Your ad can then be viewed by any party who visits the website. Interested parties will contact you through Cavegoat.com and your email is never displayed on the website unless you choose to display it.</p>\n\n<p>A userâ€™s profile on Cavegoat.com lists all the classified ads, forum topics and forum comments posted by the user. Unlike other well established classified sites, next to each classified ad, forum topic and forum comment is the number of replies and the time of the most recent reply for that entry. </p>\n\n<p>Cavegoat.com is very simple to use and it is completely free.
