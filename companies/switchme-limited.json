It involves complex relationships between generators, retailers, lines companies and Transpower. This sometimes results in complex billing calculations, which make it difficult for the average New Zealander to calculate an accurate comparison. </p>\n\n<p>Further to this, there are a number of different types of electricity meters installed around the country, meaning most pricing plans wonâ€™t even apply to you.</p>\n\n<p>Switchme have standardised all pricing plans and meter types, which means you can compare â€œapples with applesâ€ when evaluating prices.</p>\n\n<p>Their price comparison engine uses a complex calculation to provide you with a list of pricing plans and electricity retailers that apply to you.
