Decades later, research demonstrated that these views are correct.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically, the CAP philosophy is that treatment should, ideally, provide the following for every patient:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Adequate dose of medication that stops opiate craving and abuse\n* Respectful treatment\n* A professional, pleasant environment\n* The structure, support, and education required for successful outcomes\n* Coordination of care\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>CAP maintains a high level of quality in our services, as evidenced by the fact that we are accredited by the Joint Commission. What does this mean to our patients? We are constantly striving to improve patient care and safety. Our patients have a voice in assessing CAPâ€™s performance. Our overall goal is to provide the tools and support needed for each of our patientâ€™s success. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0009/5606/95606v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0009/5606/95606v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[410,90],"assets/images/resized/0009/5606/95606v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.capqualitycare.com","title":"Chicago Methadone Treatment"}]}
