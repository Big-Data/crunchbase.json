Their mission: to help family caregivers make better decisions, save time and money, and feel less alone &#8211; and less stressed &#8211; as they face the many challenges of caregiving.</p>\n\n<p>More than 40 million people in the United States care for someone over age 50, yet most have little preparation or experience when they begin their caregiving journey. To make that journey a little easier, Caring.com provides original articles, helpful tools, advice from more than 50 leading experts, a comprehensive directory of caregiving services, and the collective wisdom of an involved community. Their seasoned executive team, editors, and technical staff have decades of experience producing award-winning health and family media, and nearly all have first-hand experience as caregivers.</p>\n\n<p>Caring.com has a similar model to <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/babycenter\" title=\"BabyCenter\">BabyCenter</a>. Two of the founders, Jim Scott and Steve Fram, spent eight years at BabyCenter. </p>\n\n<p>Caring.com seems to offer more specific and tailored information in an age-related context than the <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/eons\" title=\"Eons\">Eons</a> social network for those over 50.</p>\n\n<p>Caring.com launched the &#8220;50+ Club&#8221; in April 2010 to provide weekly discounts at 50% off to people over 50 years old, a la <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/groupon\" title=\"Groupon\">Groupon</a>.
