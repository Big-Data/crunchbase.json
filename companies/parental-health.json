Sandwich Generation. Senior Tsunami.</p>\n\n<p>These buzz words translate to an astonishing reality: Our nationâ€™s healthcare system - already caring for 40 million seniors today - will be extremely overburdened by 2030, when it is projected that the number of seniors will nearly double. This, coupled with healthcare reform and a shrinking population of physicians, nurses and other care providers, requires that we uncover more efficient solutions for the delivery of care to the senior population.</p>\n\n<p>Based on decades in the healthcare, technology and senior living industries, Parental Health was founded in 2009 to leverage the power of technology to address this looming crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Located in Nashville, Tennessee, Parental Health has partnered with some of the worldâ€™s leading technology companies to bring &#8220;age in place&#8221; technology solutions to the senior market.</p>\n\n<p>We developed our signature product, MISTY, drawing on our own family experiences. The only software of its kind, MISTY is a technology platform that addresses the needs of seniors, their caregivers and their families. We service the senior and boomer market and the exponential number of family members, caregivers and businesses that serve this market.</p>\n\n<p>As baby boomers age and health reform demands more efficient solutions to the delivery of care, MISTY is a timely and affordable answer to help seniors and their caregivers manage healthcare needs. It is often referred to as the missing consumer-interface piece of the efforts to create accountable care organizations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0012/4311/124311v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0012/4311/124311v1-max-250x250.png"],[[261,51],"assets/images/resized/0012/4311/124311v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"256 Seaboard Lane H-103 ","address2":"","zip_code":"37067","city":"Franklin","state_code":"TN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0012/4312/124312v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0012/4312/124312v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0012/4312/124312v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
