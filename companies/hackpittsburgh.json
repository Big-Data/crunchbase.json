Their membership is open to everyone but typically comprises inventors, engineers, scientists, programmers, hobbyists, artists, roboteers, families, entrepreneurs, and arts and crafts enthusiasts. Their focus is on collaboration, education, and community outreach. Theyâ€™re a benevolent group and do not promote or condone illegal activities. The term â€œhackingâ€ is used in a benign sense, in the context of deconstructing and understanding objects and systems and re-purposing existing materials for new and innovative uses.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0016/4067/164067v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/4067/164067v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,109],"assets/images/resized/0016/4067/164067v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Pinkston","permalink":"nick-pinkston","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/4296/94296v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/4296/94296v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[342,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/4296/94296v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Shanning Wan</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1936 5th Ave.","address2":"","zip_code":"15219","city":"Pittsburgh","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0016/4068/164068v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,226],"assets/images/resized/0016/4068/164068v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,408],"assets/images/resized/0016/4068/164068v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
