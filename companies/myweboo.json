The userâ€™s files and data are extremely cluttered while their friends have difficulties finding and following user across multiple sites. MyWEBoo, our solution, is a Personal Management Center where users can plug in web services as Drives and manage their contents stored on Facebook, Youtube, and other platforms all in one place. We then aggregate their pictures, videos, streams, social networks, and data we collect to push out monster profiles / feeds for each user.  We aim to help people better manage both of their personal and public worlds.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0008/6443/86443v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,189],"assets/images/resized/0008/6443/86443v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[363,275],"assets/images/resized/0008/6443/86443v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder/Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Diane","last_name":"Keng","permalink":"diane-keng","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Keng","permalink":"steven-keng","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Etchin","permalink":"mark-etchin","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"448\" height=\"272\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/HHbcyR1P1Jw&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/HHbcyR1P1Jw&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"448\" height=\"272\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Web 2.0 O&#8217;Reilly Interview</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"448\" height=\"272\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/zCLNlI9_0mA&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/zCLNlI9_0mA&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"448\" height=\"272\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Promotional Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&id=7425321","title":"ABC7 News"},{"external_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/109472/teenage-entrepreneurs?mod=career-work","title":"Yahoo!
