The basic idea is that only one product is available for sale at any given time and each product is only available for 24 hours.  At midnight (US Central time), the product is replaced by a different product. If a product sells out before then, a &#8220;Sold Out&#8221; message is displayed until the next day&#8217;s product goes up.</p>\n\n<p>Woot&#8217;s 2007 revenue was $117MM.</p>\n\n<p>On June 30th 2010, the NY Times reported that Woot.com had agreed to an acquisition by Amazon for an undisclosed amount.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies with similar business models are <a href=\"http://www.WhiskeyMilitia.com\" title=\"WhiskeyMilitia\" rel=\"nofollow\">WhiskeyMilitia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ideeli\" title=\"Ideeli\">Ideeli</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gearengine.com\" title=\"GearEngine\" rel=\"nofollow\">GearEngine</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3127/3127v1-max-150x150.png"],[[149,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3127/3127v1-max-250x250.png"],[[149,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3127/3127v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Woot.com","permalink":"woot-com","image":null},{"name":"Wine.Woot.com","permalink":"wine-woot-com","image":null},{"name":"Shirt.Woot.com","permalink":"shirt-woot-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Rutledge","permalink":"matt-rutledge","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Chapin","permalink":"derek-chapin","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"ECommerce Director","person":{"first_name":"Darold","last_name":"Rydl","permalink":"darold-rydl","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"IT Director, Wholesale","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Klassen","permalink":"chris-klassen","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Director of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Myles","last_name":"Bornstad","permalink":"myles-bornstad","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"IT Director, Retail","person":{"first_name":"Luke","last_name":"Duff","permalink":"luke-duff","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Purchasing Director","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Wesner","permalink":"john-wesner","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Sales Manager","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Johnson","permalink":"jay-johnson","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Rutledge","permalink":"dave-rutledge","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Deal Comet","permalink":"deal-comet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/1458/11458v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/1458/11458v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/1458/11458v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"jellyfish","permalink":"jellyfish","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0000/2971/2971v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/2971/2971v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/2971/2971v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Tanga","permalink":"tanga","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,58],"assets/images/resized/0011/2793/112793v2-max-150x150.png"],[[129,58],"assets/images/resized/0011/2793/112793v2-max-250x250.png"],[[129,58],"assets/images/resized/0011/2793/112793v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Thing Fling","permalink":"thing-fling","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Delight.com","permalink":"delight-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/3111/23111v1-max-150x150.png"],[[130,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/3111/23111v1-max-250x250.png"],[[130,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/3111/23111v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Cinderella Wine","permalink":"cinderella-wine","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0006/1692/61692v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/1692/61692v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,59],"assets/images/resized/0006/1692/61692v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Scoutmob","permalink":"scoutmob","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/3240/73240v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/3240/73240v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[161,300],"assets/images/resized/0007/3240/73240v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Chitown Deals","permalink":"chitowndeals-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/8002/78002v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0007/8002/78002v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0007/8002/78002v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":110000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/30/woot-amazon/","source_description":"Wootâ€™s Deal Of The Day: Woot! â€” Amazon Buys It.
