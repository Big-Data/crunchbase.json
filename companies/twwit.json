You just need a twitter account.</p>\n\n<p>Why is twwit based on twitter?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is easy: 170,000,000 users. </p>\n\n<p>Yes but&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>twitter has 3 weaknesses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you can discuss in private with only one person at a time,</li>\n<li>this person must follow you otherwise you can&#8217;t send a private message (DM),</li>\n<li>the tweets can&#8217;t have more than 140 characters.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we want to exchange ideas with friends or family, to brainstorm with collegues or customers, we must use other tools. Frankly, they all have disadvantages. </p>\n\n<p>The alternative, simple &amp; easy: twwit.com</p>\n\n<p>That was our main point: twwit is easy to use. 1 click to create a discussion then, just enter the twitter usernames of the participants and that&#8217;s it! Could it be more simple?</p>\n\n<p>Discussions are privates, i.e. you must be invited and identified with your twitter account. \nTo inform participants, you have 2 choices:\n1) check the box &#8220;Send a tweet to invite&#8221;,\n2) or send by e-mail the short URL of the discussion\nIt is the same for the updates. </p>\n\n<p>Many people think 140 characters are not enough, we authorize more than 1,000 characters + asynchronous video chats.</p>\n\n<p>Maximum Security</p>\n\n<p>We use OAuth protocol to pair your twitter account with your twwit account, with no need to communicate your password. You can revoke the access anytime.\nEvery page is encrypted with 128-bits SSL certificate + your conversations are encrypted before being saved in our database. Even our developers can&#8217;t read your twwits. </p>\n\n<p>Mobility | Multi platform</p>\n\n<p>We thought it was a good idea to developp twwit for web and for mobiles, using the brand new jQuery Mobile. So you can use twwit.com from your iPhone, Android phone, Blackberry, Windows Phone, etc.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/7782/107782v2-max-150x150.png"],[[126,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/7782/107782v2-max-250x250.png"],[[126,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/7782/107782v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Hickmann","permalink":"sam-hickmann","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8736/98736v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8736/98736v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/8736/98736v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>samHickmann</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"San Francisco","address1":"26 O'Farrell St","address2":"#500","zip_code":"94103","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0011/0387/110387v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0011/0387/110387v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0011/0387/110387v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0388/110388v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/0388/110388v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[386,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/0388/110388v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[73,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0389/110389v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[122,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/0389/110389v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[219,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/0389/110389v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
