It was due to these results that the Interactive Advertising Bureau (iab), Association of American Advertising Agencies (4As) and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) announced the Viewable Impression (Ad being 50% or more viewable in terms of area for a second or longer) as a new standard.</p>\n\n<p>But, an “impression” can be 1 second long, 10 seconds long or 10 minutes long, and it is unnatural that all of these “impressions” are valued equally.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore with Dennoo, we define “Viewable Time” as the number of seconds that an ad is 50% or more visible on the screen in terms of area, and calculate the value/cost of ads based on the “Cost-per-Second” of this Viewable Time. Through this, Dennoo is able to price ads in a truly fair and transparent way. Advertisers pay for one second if the ad was shown for one second or for 10 seconds if the ad was shown for 10 seconds. Advertisers will also be provided with a set of accurate and transparent metrics that assist advertisers in grasping the true effectiveness of their campaign.</p>\n\n<p>For media, the current market had underestimated high quality media with high levels of engagement due to conventional, direct-response-based metrics such as Click-through rate (CTR) and eCPM that are fundamentally irrelevant to branding. But with Dennoo, media that have users engaged for longer periods of time will be valued for this.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Dennoo’s mission is to remove the discrepancy that the overemphasis of “impressions” and “clicks” had brought to the market, value media that have true branding potential, and to contribute to the transparency and reliability of the online advertising market.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/5253/185253v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0018/5253/185253v2-max-250x250.png"],[[299,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/5253/185253v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CPO","person":{"first_name":"Mukundu","last_name":"Kumaran","permalink":"mukundu-kumaran","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Daisuke \"Dan\"","last_name":"Nagayama","permalink":"daisuke-dan-nagayama","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/7067/187067v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/7067/187067v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/7067/187067v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Atsushi","last_name":"Ohtake","permalink":"atsushi-ohtake","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Shigeto","last_name":"\"Sid\" Umeda","permalink":"shigeto-sid-umeda","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Google","permalink":"google","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MediaMind","permalink":"mediamind","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/3281/23281v3-max-150x150.png"],[[188,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3281/23281v3-max-250x250.png"],[[188,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3281/23281v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati","permalink":"wilson-sonsini-goodrich-rosati","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0001/9486/19486v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/9486/19486v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/9486/19486v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"U.S. Headquarters","address1":"228 Hamilton Avenue 3rd Floor.    ","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Tokyo Laboratory","address1":"5th Floor, Sanwa Dai-Ichi Building 4-1-8 Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku","address2":"","zip_code":"106-0045","city":"Tokyo","state_code":null,"country_code":"JPN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"http://youtu.be/kTwjuieFZm0","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
