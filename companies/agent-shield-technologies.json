REALTORS are provided with FREE widgets with new construction properties to add to their current website which easily provide access for their clients and prospects. </p>\n\n<p>Easy to market new construction:  With 84% of buyers researching real estate online, Agent Shield allows the REALTORâ€™s prospects to continue performing their own research.   Powered by Agent Shieldâ€™s technology, the REALTORâ€™s prospects are directed (through the widget on their website or via emails) to the actual new developmentâ€™s website to research and learn more about the development.  </p>\n\n<p>Safe to market new construction:  The referring REALTOR retains full control of their prospect/lead.  When the prospect arrives at the new developmentâ€™s website, Agent Shieldâ€™s technology automatically changes all of the contact information to the referring REALTORâ€™s.  All emails sent from the contact forms go to the referring REALTOR.  The developer does not receive the leadâ€™s information.  </p>\n\n<p>Opens up 2nd home market to REALTORS:  Most areas are feeders markets for other areas.  For example, New York is the top feeder market for SW Florida.  Agent Shield provides REALTORS with access to new developments around the world thus opening the opportunity for the REALTOR to continue servicing their clients who are looking to purchase a second home elsewhere.  Servicing the second home buyer is easy. Agent Shield provides the new developmentâ€™s website as a research tool for the buyer.  </p>\n\n<p>Agent Shield will revolutionize the way new construction properties are marketed by REALTORS on the internet.  Every REALTOR can now easily expand their inventory offerings and benefit from selling new construction.  Agent Shield is FREE for REALTORS.
