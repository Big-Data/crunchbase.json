Schools, parents, speech therapists, and children all use Speech Buddies because they can cut the amount of time it takes to treat a speaking disorder in half.  Prior to Speech Buddies, speech therapists used items like coffee stirrers and peanut butter to try and achieve their clinical goals.</p>\n\n<p>Speech Buddies work by providing targets inside the mouth for children to feel correct tongue placement when attempting to pronounce problem sounds. Speech Buddies can help children turn their â€œwabbitsâ€ into â€œrabbitsâ€, â€œwessonsâ€ into â€œlessonsâ€, and â€œthocksâ€ into â€œsocksâ€. This tactile feedback within the mouth is often just what kids need to achieve learning breakthroughs.</p>\n\n<p>Speech Buddies are FDA listed and are made in California at a registered medical device facility. Our clinical standards are the most rigorous in the industry. The INTACT (Intra Oral Tactile Bio-Feedback) study, a single blind, randomized and controlled study, is one of several research initiatives underway to demonstrate the effectiveness of Speech Buddies.</p>\n\n<p>Website: www.speechbuddy.com\nPress Kit: http://speechbuddy.com/assets/files/PressKit.ATI.pdf</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0007/7539/77539v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0007/7539/77539v1-max-250x250.png"],[[400,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/7539/77539v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$410k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2010/02/12/articulate-technologies-finds-its-voice-with-new-410k/","source_description":"Articulate Technologies finds its voice with new $410K","raised_amount":410000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":12,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0011/8301/118301v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,239],"assets/images/resized/0011/8301/118301v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,430],"assets/images/resized/0011/8301/118301v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
