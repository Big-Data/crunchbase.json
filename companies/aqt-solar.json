Its mission is to achieve the best cost/performance ratio of any solar cell manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2007 and based in the heart of Silicon Valley, AQT Solar has pioneered a highly scalable and cost-efficient approach to produce low-cost, high-performance CIGS thin-film solar cells, dubbed CIGS 2.0. Unlike traditional CIGS companies, AQT has taken a highly leveraged approach, utilizing production-proven manufacturing processes from parallel high tech manufacturing segments. With minimal time and investment, the company modified  existing processes to meet its specific CIGS manufacturing requirements.  The company has reached commercial production faster and for far less investment than any company in the segment.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0016/9985/169985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,45],"assets/images/resized/0016/9985/169985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,45],"assets/images/resized/0016/9985/169985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Bartholomeusz","permalink":"michael-bartholomeusz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$18.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/01/aqt-solar-secures-18-7m-series-venture-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"AQT Solar Secures $18.7M in Series B Venture Funding","raised_amount":18700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":12,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1145 Sonora Court","address2":"","zip_code":"94086","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
