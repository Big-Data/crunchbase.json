We publish magical titles on mobile devices. </p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;re a small group of hackers and designers who are working on mobile products that will engage and excite you. We love what we do and our users love the products we&#8217;ve built.</p>\n\n<p>We are currently self-publishing titles in the Music Category and have built a platform that allows us to deliver fantastical apps which delight our users. Our designs are executed at a very high standard and our apps are educational and highly immersive at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>The 2 main areas of focus are: Music and Education. Our focus in Education is early childhood education and entertainment for kids aged between 2-5 years. </p>\n\n<p>Our past: last year we released 3 apps into the appStore and had 2 app-of-the-weeks under a different banner. We&#8217;re having fun doing what we do best - building consumer facing products on mobile devices. </p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve raised money from Mitch Kapor and 500 Startups.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,118],"assets/images/resized/0011/6938/116938v2-max-150x150.png"],[[90,118],"assets/images/resized/0011/6938/116938v2-max-250x250.png"],[[90,118],"assets/images/resized/0011/6938/116938v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"The
