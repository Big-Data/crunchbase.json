The company, a Carnegie Mellon University spinoff, has developed patent-pending technologies utilizing advanced methods for learning drivers&#8217; routing preferences and predicting their destinations by observing their driving patterns. This technology enables navigation solutions that automatically adapt to each driver&#8217;s navigation preferences and provide relevant information based on the predicted destinations.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$25k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.alphalab.org/meet_our_companies.aspx","source_description":"InnovationWorks AlphaLab Meet Our Companies","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"AlphaLab","permalink":"alphalab","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0006/0041/60041v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0006/0041/60041v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,174],"assets/images/resized/0006/0041/60041v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/FzQ_2FLfIdM&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/FzQ_2FLfIdM&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Personal Navigation Research Video</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/czxTfJompkY&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/czxTfJompkY&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Destination Prediction Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
