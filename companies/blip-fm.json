Users post short messages on what music they are listening to at the moment, the site then turns them into streaming links using <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/imeem\" title=\"Imeem\">Imeem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Blip is essentially â€œTwitter for Music.â€ It allows you to suggest music and share your thoughts about it with a network of contacts.</p>\n\n<p>No file uploads are necessary. Just search for the song you have in mind and Blip will grab it from Imeem. Your followers (â€listenersâ€) can hear full versions of the songs you post using Imeem&#8217;s player widget.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/5725/25725v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/5725/25725v2-max-250x250.png"],[[140,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/5725/25725v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"COO, Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Venneman","permalink":"brian-venneman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Yasuda","permalink":"jeff-yasuda","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0004/2000/42000v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0004/2000/42000v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[432,288],"assets/images/resized/0004/2000/42000v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Tyler Callister</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"White","permalink":"ian-white-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/0185/60185v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/0185/60185v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,267],"assets/images/resized/0006/0185/60185v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Software Developer","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Downing","permalink":"ryan-downing","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/0186/60186v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,196],"assets/images/resized/0006/0186/60186v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[196,196],"assets/images/resized/0006/0186/60186v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Creator/Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Arin","last_name":"Sarkissian","permalink":"arin-sarkissian","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0004/4522/44522v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0004/4522/44522v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0004/4522/44522v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Arin</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Mika","last_name":"Salmi","permalink":"mika-salmi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/0495/20495v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,235],"assets/images/resized/0002/0495/20495v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,235],"assets/images/resized/0002/0495/20495v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>reuters</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"twt.fm","permalink":"twt-fm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[91,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/1635/41635v1-max-150x150.png"],[[91,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/1635/41635v1-max-250x250.png"],[[91,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/1635/41635v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Blip.fm","address1":"602 20th Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.7605236,"longitude":-122.3877986}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0003/3967/33967v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,162],"assets/images/resized/0003/3967/33967v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,292],"assets/images/resized/0003/3967/33967v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0003/9562/39562v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/9562/39562v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,216],"assets/images/resized/0003/9562/39562v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
