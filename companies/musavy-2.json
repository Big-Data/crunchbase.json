This will lead users to build robust knowledge in real-time, and take proper actions.</p>\n\n<p>Our key message is &#8220;DEBATING IS CURATING&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Musavy fills a big missing point on the web. Every information heats up by news, and cool down at some point. But, we have no media to cool down effectively since social media all design one-way transmission and focus on spreading information, not converging the information into knowledge. Thus, false, half-baked, and trustful information is mixed across the web. In addition, searching without basic understanding requires us much time and efforts to grasp the details for the specific knowledge. Thatâ€™s how we feel overwhelmed by information.</p>\n\n<p>Musavy solves this problem. Debate works more naturally than Q&amp;A as a filter.  Most importantly, our stylish design and Savy Engine leads users to create and engage in debate more casually and actively.</p>\n\n<p>The accumulated viewpoints in Musavy will effectively help you build robust knowledge in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>We are on Tech Crunch.\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2011/04/16/teclosion-2011-spring-japan/</p>\n\n<p>Here is our samples.
