Developed by UK-based Reynardine Software, TextQube makes it very easy for companies to mobilise their existing data by simply querying database information on a PC by SMS.</p>\n\n<p>We all agreed that TextQube has real potential to drive more innovation in 2-way SMS as it allows businesses to trial a service to assess the business case before committing to further development and enhancements.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Thompson of Reynardine Software said â€œItâ€™s terrific to win this competition and a big thanks to Esendex for the opportunity to demonstrate the product and Reynardineâ€™s passion for efficient 2-way communication by mobile. TextQube is fantastic for SMEs that want to mobilise and control information on a new level.â€</p>\n\n<p>Two runners-up have been awarded Â£500 each, CotralisSMSGPS from the Netherlands, and CallMeBack from Singapore. CotralisSMSGPS, chosen because it uses SMS to augment a blog post with a location, enables blog postings to be made from anywhere. Conference call service, CallMeBack was chosen due to its ability to use SMS to put the user in control of a conference call.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Short commented, â€œAll entries to the challenge have shown extraordinary levels of creativity and innovation. Dedicated to the mobile industry, Iâ€™m always eager to know about new developments so it was interesting for me to see the ideas that people have for the use of 2-way SMS.â€</p>\n\n<p>â€œAs a mobile fanatic, Iâ€™ve really enjoyed judging this competitionâ€ said Ewan MacLeod. â€œThe high quality of entrants reflected the interest in technology for the future of SMS as a communication and business service.â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0005/2635/52635v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/2635/52635v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,90],"assets/images/resized/0005/2635/52635v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"whiamsmsgps mobile","permalink":"whiamsmsgps-mobile","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/2634/52634v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/2634/52634v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/2634/52634v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
