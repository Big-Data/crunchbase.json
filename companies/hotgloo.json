The application stands out for its intuitive design and high standard of interactivity. The focus is set very clearly on interaction and collaboration. With HotGloo, it&#8217;s possible to wireframe together with a team on one project at the same time. With HotGloo it doesn&#8217;t matter if the project is a small website or a huge web project. The user can choose between basic elements and interactions or smart elements and expert interactions - turning wireframes into working prototypes - for an even more interactive look and feel. Feedback notes are a great way to discuss the development process, annotate on others work or to leave further specifications for designers and developers - suddenly iterations are becoming less painless.</p>\n\n<p>HotGloo has been designed especially for webworkers: ux people, information architects, project managers, designers, IT people, working as freelancers, in small project groups or large agencies.
