Instead of yet another tool to implement alongside your other programs, tibbr works on top of your existing technologies, platform(s) and IT investments to socialize data and let people and teams follow the work topics and projects that matter to them, all in one easy view. </p>\n\n<p>With tibbr, people aren’t the only participants: applications, any and all existing systems (CRM, ERP, etc.), geo-contextual resources and even files are all contributing to the social environment. The result? Data shares itself and people get real work done.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone at a company can get going on tibbr instantly for free, and be up and running right away. tibbr features enterprise-grade security, governance, and compliance, including the ability to install tibbr behind the firewall.</p>\n\n<p>tibbr is headed by Ram Menon, TIBCO’s President of Social Computing, and is based in Palo Alto.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/4808/164808v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/4808/164808v2-max-250x250.png"],[[359,359],"assets/images/resized/0016/4808/164808v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vivek","last_name":"Ranadive","permalink":"vivek-ranadiv","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Ram","last_name":"Menon","permalink":"ram-menon","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Jive Software","permalink":"jive-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[420,200],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"chatter.com","permalink":"chatter-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0012/2162/122162v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/2162/122162v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/2162/122162v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Yammer","permalink":"yammer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/4256/24256v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/4256/24256v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,92],"assets/images/resized/0002/4256/24256v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"TIBCO Software Inc.","address1":"3303 Hillview Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"94304","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.tibbr.com","title":"tibbr"},{"external_url":"http://startuptunes.com/2012/03/22/tibbr-a-social-network-for-enterprise/","title":""}]}
