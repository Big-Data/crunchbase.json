This has various benefits:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Introduces your site visitors to what you are doing on Twitter</p></li>\n<li><p>Keeps your site visitors on your site</p></li>\n<li><p>Has a viral traffic generating potential proportional to the amount of tweeting conducted via your TB; Every tweet (or reply) posted via the app is pushed to Twitter with a link back to your site. The link back is not a lame attempt at bringing twitter traffic to your site, but a means of providing <em>context</em> to the conversation: Parent tweets are appended with a http://posted.at/XXX link, while replies are appended with http://inreply.to/XXX (Friendfeed uses this approach with http://ff.im/XXX, as well as Disqus, with http://disq.us/XXX - none provide context with the link itself, as TB does.)</p></li>\n</ol>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[61,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1041/51041v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[103,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/1041/51041v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[165,400],"assets/images/resized/0005/1041/51041v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Tweetboard","permalink":"tweetboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0005/1042/51042v3-max-150x150.png"],[[235,35],"assets/images/resized/0005/1042/51042v3-max-250x250.png"],[[235,35],"assets/images/resized/0005/1042/51042v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Social Media Specialist, Software Architect","person":{"first_name":"Matias","last_name":"Paterlini","permalink":"matias-paterlini","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/4239/54239v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0005/4239/54239v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0005/4239/54239v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Quotably","permalink":"quotably","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/6260/16260v1-max-150x150.png"],[[218,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/6260/16260v1-max-250x250.png"],[[218,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/6260/16260v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"tweetree","permalink":"tweetree","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Tweetizen","permalink":"tweetizen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0003/8105/38105v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0003/8105/38105v2-max-250x250.png"],[[432,300],"assets/images/resized/0003/8105/38105v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Twibs","permalink":"twibs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/7540/37540v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/7540/37540v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/7540/37540v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Tweetboard","address1":"257 Calle Aduana #145","address2":"","zip_code":"00682","city":"Mayaguez","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRI","latitude":18.2066344,"longitude":-67.1517568}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
