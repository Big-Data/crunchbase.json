There are plenty of places where existing startups can get help, funding, and mentorship. Churn is not one of them. It does not want to just politely assist; it wants to do. Rather than find companies to help, Churn Labs finds entrepreneurial people: engineers, designers and product specialists and we brainstorm, prototype, and build companies together.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s often said that the best part of building a company is the beginning. Things are still small, teams are close and committed, and the only thing that matters is building a great product. The plan is for Churn to always be at the beginning. It builds things in cycles. In each cycle many things are prototyped, a few are launched, and if lucky, one is spun out into a self operating company. Then the cycle begins again.</p>\n\n<p>Churn has offices in the San Francisco Bay Area and Irvine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/5842/125842v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0012/5842/125842v1-max-250x250.png"],[[269,90],"assets/images/resized/0012/5842/125842v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Gnonstop Gnomes","permalink":"gnonstop-gnomes","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"Hamoui","permalink":"omar-hamoui","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6621/16621v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6621/16621v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6621/16621v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"george-chen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0012/5848/125848v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0012/5848/125848v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0012/5848/125848v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Sponer","permalink":"matt-sponer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Thompson","permalink":"james-thompson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Rowehl","permalink":"mike-rowehl","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5854/125854v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5854/125854v3-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0012/5854/125854v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Haider","last_name":"Sabri","permalink":"haider-sabri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0012/5849/125849v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,221],"assets/images/resized/0012/5849/125849v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,398],"assets/images/resized/0012/5849/125849v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Wayne","last_name":"Pan","permalink":"wayne-pan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"andrew-wong","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Team Member","person":{"first_name":"Seni","last_name":"Sangrujee","permalink":"seni-sangrujee","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Seamus","last_name":"McAteer","permalink":"seamus-mcateer","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sequoia Capital","permalink":"sequoia-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"60 East 3rd Ave","address2":"Suite 262","zip_code":"94401","city":"San Mateo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"8105 Irvine Center Dr","address2":"Suite 1110","zip_code":"92618","city":"Irvine","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
