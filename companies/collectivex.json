Groupsites are collaboration communities that enable groups to communicate, share and network to make things happen. They do this by combining the most useful (but not all) features of online groups and listservs (like Yahoo! Groups), collaboration software (like Sharepoint) and Social Networks (like Facebook and Linkedin). </p>\n\n<p>We call this &#8220;social collaboration.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>We believe groups provide the context for making things happen. Most &#8220;social networks&#8221; start with you as the center of the world and your &#8220;page&#8221; as the main focus. You then &#8220;friend&#8221; or link to others forming a network around you.  Groupsites are group-centric: the group is the center of everything. Groupsites are group-agnostic: they can be used by professional or social groups, large or small groups, and private or public groups. Groupsites include: (http://www.collectivex.com/tour)</p>\n\n<p>Over 24,000 Groupsites have been created as of February 2009. </p>\n\n<p><a
