These wireless IP routers, called Internet RadiosTM, simplify the issues of deploying a wireless broadband Internet access network. Rooftop&#8217;s Internet Radios are a new class of product that allow ISPs, carriers and private enterprises to bypass the wired local loop with fast, always-on, wireless networks. The state-of the-art Internet Radios combine high performance digital radio frequency platforms with Rooftop&#8217;s Internet Radio Operating System (IROS)TM, an extension of the industry standard IP protocol suite, designed to optimize wireless traffic performance, and manage the issues unique to wireless networks. </p>\n\n<p>Rooftop Communications Corporation was founded by a team of experts in IP-based, wireless Internet technology in 1995. Rooftop&#8217;s wireless packet switched technology evolved from the same government research programs that funded development of the Internet, and its technical team has been working with academic and commercial experts to develop rapidly deployable, packet-switched wireless IP networks. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Beyer","permalink":"david-beyer-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":57000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash_and_stock","source_url":"http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/archive/archiveshowpressrelease?newsid=776032","source_description":"Nokia acquires Rooftop Communications to boost its wireless IP bypass technology portfolio ","acquired_year":1999,"acquired_month":9,"acquired_day":2,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Nokia","permalink":"nokia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7958/17958v3-max-150x150.png"],[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7958/17958v3-max-250x250.png"],[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7958/17958v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"785 Castro St","address2":"","zip_code":"94041","city":"Mountain View","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
