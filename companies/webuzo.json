These Virtual Appliances are compatible with VMWare products and Oracle&#8217;s VirtualBox. \nOur virtual appliance is based on CentOS x86_64 Platform. \nYou can deploy Webuzo Virtual Appliances on your Desktop, in the Office or for local Intranet usage. </p>\n\n<p>We have made a Video of how easy it is to use a Webuzo Virtual Appliance : \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkgHB6UUBh4 </p>\n\n<p>You can Download any of the Virtual Appliances from our Webuzo.com by visiting the respective Application page. e.g. you get the MediWiki Virtual Appliance from the following link : \nhttp://www.webuzo.com/apps/php/wikis/MediaWiki </p>\n\n<p>So whats the installation procedure in case of VPS and Dedicated Servers ? \nInstalling Webuzo is very simple. You can install Webuzo on any freshly installed CentOS Machine : \nhttp://www.webuzo.com/wiki/Install </p>\n\n<p>Can I deploy this on the Cloud ? \nYes, you can as long you use a CentOS instance. We are also working on a interface where you can deploy Apps in seconds on Clouds like the Amazon EC2, RackSpace Cloud, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Is this a Shared Hosting Control Panel ? \nNo, it is not a Shared hosting control panel as only one user can be created. \nYou can add any number of Domains and subdomains but only under the single account created. \nSince its not a Shared Hosting Panel it works much faster as it has only the required server software for these Apps. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/0680/170680v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0017/0680/170680v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0017/0680/170680v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/G_Fla6WaEmE?version=3&feature=player_detailpage\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/G_Fla6WaEmE?version=3&feature=player_detailpage\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></object>","description":"<p>Run Webuzo through VMware Workstation </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/0679/170679v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/0679/170679v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0017/0679/170679v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0017/0827/170827v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,191],"assets/images/resized/0017/0827/170827v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,344],"assets/images/resized/0017/0827/170827v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
