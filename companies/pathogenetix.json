The company&#8217;s approach, which employs a single reagent set to generate genomic bar codes based on bacterial DNA, can cost-effectively identify thousands of strains in a single test from complex samples in three hours.  PathoGenetiX is developing its GSS platform for use in genomics research, food and product safety testing, and clinical infectious disease diagnostics, with initial commercial introduction into the research market planned for 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0007/4248/74248v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0007/4248/74248v2-max-250x250.png"],[[323,109],"assets/images/resized/0007/4248/74248v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"J.
