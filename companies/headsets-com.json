We carry the largest inventory of headsets and accessories from industry leaders like Sennheiser, Plantronics, and Jabra (GN Netcom), as well as featuring our own Executive Pro line. Whatever you need in a headset, you can be sure to find here.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Faith, President and CEO, started the company in 1997 when he wanted to increase his productivity with a telephone headset, but couldnâ€™t find a good resource for them. He wanted to find a company that had a great selection, knew the products, and could support them after the purchase. Since a company like that didnâ€™t exist at the time, he realized there was an untapped niche in the marketplace, so he started a company himself that would fill this void.</p>\n\n<p>Our friendly, award-winning headset specialists provide world class Customer Service because we focus on your needs, and make sure weâ€™ve met them. Weâ€™re proud of our spotless record with the Better Business Bureau; weâ€™ve received zero complaints in our history. Our commitment to Customer Service is illustrated by our offer of free lifetime product support for everything we sell. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0011/6112/116112v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/6112/116112v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/6112/116112v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Faith","permalink":"mike-faith","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Digital Forest","permalink":"digital-forest","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"One Daniel Burnham Court","address2":"Suite 400C","zip_code":"94109","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/6111/116111v2-max-150x150.png"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/6111/116111v2-max-250x250.png"],[[338,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/6111/116111v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
