Users can search for an artist or track, and play the song directly on the site. Each song is accompanied by writing from the blog post, along with links to the blog and links to iTunes and Amazon to buy the song. HypeMachine provides a list of all of the blogs they crawl. The service also has what they call a radio, which actually just suggests songs and leaves it up to the user to play each song.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pandora\" title=\"Pandora\">Pandora</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/lala\" title=\"lala\">lala</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/imeem\" title=\"Imeem\">Imeem</a>, HypeMachine&#8217;s music is not licensed.
