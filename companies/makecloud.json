In contrast, many well known examples of tag clouds, such as those seen on del.ico.us or flickr, are created by analyzing tags that humans entered. One major advantage of our approach is that tag clouds can be automatically generated from data that has not been tagged by people, such as data that changes too frequently for a person to tag. RSS data sources are now ubiquitous, and it is possible to turn nearly any data set into RSS, which makes it an extremely flexible input data source for MakeCloud.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0006/8169/68169v2-max-150x150.png"],[[240,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/8169/68169v2-max-250x250.png"],[[240,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/8169/68169v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Forrest","last_name":"Briggs","permalink":"forrest-briggs","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Gaber","permalink":"alex-gaber","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/xgVLV9X42x4&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/xgVLV9X42x4&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[96,96],"assets/images/resized/0006/6456/66456v2-max-150x150.png"],[[96,96],"assets/images/resized/0006/6456/66456v2-max-250x250.png"],[[96,96],"assets/images/resized/0006/6456/66456v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.blogcatalog.com/blogs/news-about-makecloudcom-tag-clouds-widgets-rss-blogs-etc.html","title":"BlogCatalog"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/makecloud-com-make-tag-clouds-from-rss-feeds","title":"Killer Startups"}]}
