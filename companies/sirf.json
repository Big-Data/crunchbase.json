SiRFâ€™s location-awareness solutions are based on the Global Positioning System (GPS), the same technology used to guide everything from the space shuttle to car navigation systems to handheld devices used by backpackers. Created by the U.S. military, GPS uses more than 24 satellites in orbit around the earth to provide always-on location information free of charge to any GPS receiver, anywhere in the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[71,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/5405/35405v1-max-150x150.png"],[[71,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/5405/35405v1-max-250x250.png"],[[71,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/5405/35405v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/06/22/sirf-buys-centrality-maker-of-chips-for-mobile-navigation-for-238m/","source_description":"SiRF buys Centrality, maker of chips for mobile navigation, for $283M","acquired_year":2007,"acquired_month":6,"acquired_day":22,"company":{"name":"Centrality Communications","permalink":"centrality-communications","image":null}}],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"217 devcon dr","address2":"","zip_code":"95112","city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.375,"longitude":-121.913706}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
