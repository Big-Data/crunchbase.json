ShopWiki uses crawling technology to find anything and everything on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>It was founded by two former DoubleClick Executives, Kevin Ryan (former DCLK CEO) and Dwight Merriman (former DCLK CTO and Co-Founder) along with a software developer from DoubleClick Eliot Horowitz.</p>\n\n<p>ShopWiki does not sell any products, it simply help our users find any product available for sale on the Web. ShopWiki actively crawls the Internet to find and organize the widest selection of products from more than 250,000 online merchants.  With international expansions in the UK, France, Australia, Germany, and The Netherlands, ShopWiki will continue to bring it&#8217;s crawling technology to countries which may not have had such a shopping experience.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/4674/24674v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/4674/24674v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,132],"assets/images/resized/0002/4674/24674v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"www.shopwiki.com","permalink":"www-shopwiki-com-2","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.co.uk","permalink":"www-shopwiki-co-uk-2","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.de","permalink":"www-shopwiki-de-2","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.fr","permalink":"www-shopwiki-fr-2","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.nl","permalink":"www-shopwiki-nl-2","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.com.au","permalink":"www-shopwiki-com-au-2","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.es","permalink":"www-shopwiki-es","image":null},{"name":"www.shopwiki.ca","permalink":"www-shopwiki-ca","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP
