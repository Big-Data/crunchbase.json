All songs are free to start, but prices fluctuate over time based on demand.  The site, started by three Brown University seniors, gives artists 70% of revenues after taking the first $5 of revenue from each song.</p>\n\n<p>AmieStreet has partnered with a number of labels including Nettwerk Music Group, INgrooves, Daptone Records and United For Opportunity (UFO).  Music from these labels is sold in the same manner as all other music on AmieStreet. The service&#8217;s closest competitor is <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sellaband\" title=\"SellABand\">SellABand</a>, which also has a socially driven music monetization
