They can never be different from one another. </p>\n\n<p>younity is also able to integrate online services directly into the device OS to simplify and streamline access to one&#8217;s files- whether locally on a device or online- in one single, familiar place.</p>\n\n<p>By virtualizing data, younity maintains a single, common view of all a user&#8217;s files, even if the device does not have enough storage for them. Simply open a file like it was stored locally, and it is streamed on-demand.</p>\n\n<p>younity aims to deliver on the promise of &#8220;context-based device usage&#8221; - where a user never thinks about what device to use based on any consideration of data. Simply grab any device that is convenient and never think about it.</p>\n\n<p>They have offices in Los Angeles and Boulder.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0013/1229/131229v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0013/1229/131229v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,129],"assets/images/resized/0013/1229/131229v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Caso","permalink":"erik-caso","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Abraham","permalink":"mike-abraham","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor/ Investor","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Scharff","permalink":"michael-scharff","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0386/100386v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[184,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/0386/100386v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[218,296],"assets/images/resized/0010/0386/100386v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"iCloud","permalink":"icloud","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"SugarSync","permalink":"sugarsync","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/3438/73438v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0007/3438/73438v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0007/3438/73438v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Syncplicity","permalink":"syncplicity","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/7902/17902v3-max-150x150.png"],[[206,47],"assets/images/resized/0001/7902/17902v3-max-250x250.png"],[[206,47],"assets/images/resized/0001/7902/17902v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
