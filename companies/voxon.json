Such devices have previously cost upwards of US$30k - the VoxieBox will take advantage of recent advances in hardware and a novel design to make early developer kits available in the sub US$3k price range in order to build out games, applications, and volumetric 3D video content for the VoxieShop app store. </p>\n\n<p>The company is founded by Alan Jackson and Sean Kean. Alan is the inventor of The Quantum Atom - an interactive exhibit at the New York Hall of Science since the 1980&#8217;s which uses lasers and unique swept volume mechanism to paint the states of the Hydrogen atom into 3D space. Sean Kean is the co-author of Meet the Kinect ( http://meetthekinect.com ), organizer of the Volumetric Society of NYC ( http://meetup.com/volumetric ), and co-founder of VOLUMETRIC Magazine ( http://volumetric.co ). </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Jackson","permalink":"alan-jackson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"c/o General Assembly","address1":"902 Broadway, 4F Box 127","address2":"","zip_code":"10010","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
