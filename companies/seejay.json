More and more often online newspapers and magazines, blogs, webzines and in general the portals that distribute information invite their readers to send photos, videos and their own accounts of the events and facts of the day. When publishers open &#8220;a window&#8221; to their readers (via emails or forms) the editorial staff is inundated with material.\nThe result is a mass of disorganised content, devoid of cataloguing (tags, geographic locations or topics) and difficult to verify, with attachments to be read one by one in a long and time-consuming selection process. In addition, the photo galleries produced remain on the publisher&#8217;s page for just a few hours before disappearing.\nThe entire process that takes the publisher from the initial request and arrival of the material, to its organisation, selection and publication, is therefore completely inefficient.\nSeeJay optimises this process, presenting itself as a multichannel cloud management system integrated with the publisher&#8217;s digital platforms (website and mobile app).\nSeeJay is therefore a tool aimed at publishers (journalists, bloggers, editors and their staff) for the management of citizen journalism.\nAnd not only: SeeJay also targets brands and communication agencies for the creation of innovative marketing campaigns based on collective storytelling.\nIt is also a tool directed at public administrations and both public and private corporations for the implementation of real forms of e-democracy and user empowerment.  </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Brunelleschi","permalink":"carlo-brunelleschi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Francesco","last_name":"Comi","permalink":"francesco-comi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Fabrizio","last_name":"Ferreri","permalink":"fabrizio-ferreri","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CCO","person":{"first_name":"Fabrizio","last_name":"Verrocchi","permalink":"fabrizio-verrocchi","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Storify","permalink":"storify","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0009/2806/92806v12-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0009/2806/92806v12-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,114],"assets/images/resized/0009/2806/92806v12-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Stolif","permalink":"stolif","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Qwiki","permalink":"qwiki","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/2672/102672v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[203,70],"assets/images/resized/0010/2672/102672v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[203,70],"assets/images/resized/0010/2672/102672v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Flipboard","permalink":"flipboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-150x150.png"],[[198,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-250x250.png"],[[300,377],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Prismatic","permalink":"prismatic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0018/3975/183975v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0018/3975/183975v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0018/3975/183975v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬50k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Milan","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Rome","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.chefuturo.it/2012/04/fabrizio-verrocchi-si-balla-con-le-dita-e-viene-dal-futuro-e-il-citizen-journalism/","title":""}]}
