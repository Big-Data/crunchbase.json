Our focus is to prevent data leaks at the hands of trusted users such as employees, partners, customers, vendors, suppliers and friends. We provide control over the information for the owner/creator of the information for its life time.</p>\n\n<p>pawaaFILE packs multiple innovations:  one of the major innovation is that we removed the need for the key manager - with that we removed all complexities and vulnerabilities of key manager. </p>\n\n<p>pawaaFILE wraps around the native file and encrypts the content with 4 random keys.  Once the native file is converted to .paw file, only authorized users can access the information at authorized location for permitted duration as per the usage policy with complete audit trail.</p>\n\n<p>pawaaFILE is unique and disruptive.  But to take full advantage of the technology, we built an implementation model called PLUSPawaa that abstracted the technology to such an extent that it can be attached to any application like a printer. </p>\n\n<p>We have already integrated Pawaa with some of key applications like Business Objects, Gmail, SugarCRM, Liferay among others.  We have also developed our own product based on our own technology called pawaaSHARE.  </p>\n\n<p>The most exciting application is pawaaDOCS - which is the Google Apps integration.  With this, users can send attachments but protect the information for life time, even after the mail is gone, sender can control who can access the files, for how long and how they can use the file (print, copy &amp; paste, screenshot, make copies, etc.).  This marketplace application is available at </p>\n\n<p>http://bit.ly/pOmPq3</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0019/1443/191443v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0019/1443/191443v2-max-250x250.png"],[[432,138],"assets/images/resized/0019/1443/191443v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Bangalore","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Singapore","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"44365 Premier Plaza, Suite 220","address2":"","zip_code":"20147","city":"Ashburn","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0014/4142/144142v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,102],"assets/images/resized/0014/4142/144142v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,184],"assets/images/resized/0014/4142/144142v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0014/4143/144143v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0014/4143/144143v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0014/4143/144143v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
