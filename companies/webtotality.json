Unfortunately, some of the most common and ubiquitous business content is unsupported by standard web technologies. For example, over 80% of companies use Microsoft Word to generate business documents but must create and view them separately from web workflows. Adobe PDF files and images have only limited view options in the browser. Many companies have invested millions in networked copiers, scanners &amp; printers but must endure inadequate print and scan functionality from the web. </p>\n\n<p>Using WebTotality software, web application workflows can now support Microsoft Office documents, high quality print &amp; scan functionality, Adobe PDF, high resolution images, and more.</p>\n\n<p>View and mashup Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF or high-res images with other content on a web page. Insert tags to create dynamic views on-the-fly. Create, edit and collaborate. All controlled by the web app.</p>\n\n<p>Take full advantage of the capabilities of these modern networked copiers and printers. Web workflows can now scan to compressed PDF or Microsoft Word files. They can have the print quality afforded by Adobe PDF technology. Paper trays can be selected on a page-by-page basis. This advanced print &amp; scan capability is available to any device with a browser, including mobile phones and tablets.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/6023/106023v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0010/6023/106023v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,163],"assets/images/resized/0010/6023/106023v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Totality Content Server","permalink":"totality-content-server","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/5540/145540v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[216,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/5540/145540v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[321,371],"assets/images/resized/0014/5540/145540v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"Totality PS","permalink":"totality-ps","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/5550/145550v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[186,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/5550/145550v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[290,388],"assets/images/resized/0014/5550/145550v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"Totality Connectors","permalink":"totality-connectors","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0014/5551/145551v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,239],"assets/images/resized/0014/5551/145551v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[387,370],"assets/images/resized/0014/5551/145551v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"Tidd","permalink":"jeffrey-tidd","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Imaging Scientist","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Tidd","permalink":"james-tidd","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"2825 E Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 500","address2":"","zip_code":"84124 ","city":"Salt Lake City","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0014/3567/143567v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,206],"assets/images/resized/0014/3567/143567v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,371],"assets/images/resized/0014/3567/143567v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/3568/143568v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[243,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/3568/143568v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[438,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/3568/143568v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.webtotality.com/totality_ps.html","title":"Totality PS Page"},{"external_url":"http://www.webtotality.com/totality_content_server.html","title":"Totality Content Server Page"}]}
