Plus, we provide tools for professional caregivers to reach out to their clients and their families and increase sales.</p>\n\n<p>MCE’s online and mobile solutions are about more than just storing and sharing information (which we do), but about helping everyone in the family take an active part in caring-no matter how far apart they are.</p>\n\n<p>Our care coordination solutions allow families to find and then buy situation recommended products and services; track daily care updates; create and securely store care and emergency plans; find actionable how-to’s and reach out to family, friends and professionals for help. From “how and who will help upgrade mom’s toilet to a handicap accessible one” to “how and who can help pay for dad’s bars in his bathtub,” MCE helps manage everyday living.  The result – improved communication, better managed care, more efficiency, and less stress.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0018/2275/182275v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0018/2275/182275v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,163],"assets/images/resized/0018/2275/182275v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
