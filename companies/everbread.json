Drawing on different industry data sources, HAYSTACK returns a broader range of flight options to B2B customers and through them, to the end consumer. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the variety of data sources, improved algorithms and custom-built hardware to match the software needs, HAYSTACK is built as an accurate, faster, and comprehensive pricing and shopping engine that provides an extended result set of priced itineraries and flight options. </p>\n\n<p>EVERBREAD takes pride in offering unique flight options - such as split-ticketing and virtual interlining (for example, fly San Francisco to Prague by using Virgin America for a flight to Las Vegas and then jump onto a Condor flight from Las Vegas to Prague, taking advantage of a great promotional fare. Such an itinerary would save you $200-$300 just on the one-way trip). </p>\n\n<p>HAYSTACK is a B2B solution, servicing the following customer groups</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Traditional Carriers</li>\n<li>Low-Cost Carriers</li>\n<li>Online Travel Agencies</li>\n<li>Meta-Search Engines</li>\n<li>Travel Management Companies</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0008/1425/81425v6-max-150x150.png"],[[213,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/1425/81425v6-max-250x250.png"],[[213,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/1425/81425v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Assen","last_name":"Vassilev","permalink":"assen-vassilev","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Klaus","last_name":"Lovgreen","permalink":"klaus-lovgreen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0002/8431/28431v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,183],"assets/images/resized/0002/8431/28431v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,183],"assets/images/resized/0002/8431/28431v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Ashley","last_name":"Raiteri","permalink":"ashley-raiteri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/0965/90965v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/0965/90965v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/0965/90965v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Morten","last_name":"Lund","permalink":"morten-lund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/3816/33816v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,122],"assets/images/resized/0003/3816/33816v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,220],"assets/images/resized/0003/3816/33816v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Morten Lund</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Ashley","last_name":"Raiteri","permalink":"ashley-raiteri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/0965/90965v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/0965/90965v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/0965/90965v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"ian-smith-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,130],"assets/images/resized/0013/2535/132535v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[108,130],"assets/images/resized/0013/2535/132535v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[108,130],"assets/images/resized/0013/2535/132535v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London Office","address1":"GROVE HOUSE","address2":"2 ORANGE STREET","zip_code":"WC2H 7DF","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232/?video=1619847722&play=1","title":"Travel's Next Tech Wave"}]}
