These goals drive every feature we develop for our software. Everything we create must be intuitive, simple, and provide value to your company. Noodle aims to be the central knowledge repository for any corporation that can capitalize on the use of stored information.</p>\n\n<p>Problem we solve\nCompanies are currently relying on email, file servers and static web pages for information sharing. Email is becoming less valuable with the current volume of spam, file servers only hold a single information type and static web pages become outdated quickly. Having multiple locations and methods only hinder effective collaboration and ultimately cost the enterprise by having users waste time searching for the information they need or even worse using the wrong information to complete tasks.</p>\n\n<p>What makes us unique\nWe believe strongly that its people that drive businesses. Noodle is designed with people in mind and it provides the tools that allows those people to contribute to important initiatives within the business.</p>\n\n<p>With the most flexible deployment options in the industry - including software as a service, traditional software and dedicates servers we can fulfill any client deployment preference.</p>\n\n<p>We have been building, deploying and supporting web software for over 5 years and its that experience that allows us to provide value to our clients.</p>\n\n<p>Our clients\nOur customers are the most important aspect to our business.
