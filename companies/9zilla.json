The highest bid wins. That&#8217;s it! Not the last bidder, but the highest bidder! </p>\n\n<p>• EXCLUSIVE AUCTIONZ- We limit the number of people &amp; BidZ in EVERY Auction. In most of our AuctionZ, there will only be 99 BidZ or fewer, with each person potentially having the opportunity to purchase up to 5 BidZ. </p>\n\n<p>• LESS COMPETITION/LOWER RISK- In 9ZillA&#8217;s AuctionZ, you will not be competing against hundreds or even thousands of other people and BidZ. You have a much better chance of winning with us compared to other Auction sites. </p>\n\n<p>• LESS EXPENSIVE- Along with giving you a better, more increased chance of winning compared to other Auction sites, 9ZillA&#8217;s AuctionZ are less expensive. With some BidZ starting at only 99 cents, you won&#8217;t be out of tens or even hundreds of dollars like other Auction sites. </p>\n\n<p>• 9ZILLA WON&#8217;T TOLERATE, OR ENCOURAGE POWER BIDDERS- Power Bidding is highly discouraged. This is not in the spirit of why 9ZillA was founded, and 9ZillA does have plans in place if this does become a problem. Please see our RuleZ page for further details about how we plan to combat Power Bidders. </p>\n\n<p>• GREAT VARIETY OF ITEMS TO BID ON- From Gift Cards to Electronics, Sports &amp; Outdoors to Home &amp; Garden, 9ZillA has something for everyone. Always brand new, named brand merchandise in our AuctionZ.</p>\n\n<p>• REWARDS FOR THE 2ND AND 3RD HIGHEST BIDZ- It&#8217;s not just the highest bid that wins at 9ZillA, because we also reward the 2nd and 3rd highest bid in the form of ZillA BuckZ. The 2nd highest bid receives 2% of the value of the item being auctioned, and 3rd place receives 1%. </p>\n\n<p>• FREE SHIPPING- 9ZillA offers Free Shipping on all items!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/3175/213175v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[123,175],"assets/images/resized/0021/3175/213175v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[123,175],"assets/images/resized/0021/3175/213175v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
