The company provides clients with optimal placements by combining recruiter interactions and experience with data-driven findings about candidates.  </p>\n\n<p>Riviera has created a unique approach for recruiting services that combines recruiters’ insight with its proprietary data system, the Riviera Index, to predict the best candidate match for its clients. The Index includes curated data (recruiter assessments), analytics and a scoring system based on a specific set of objective metrics. This data ensures every Riviera recruiter has shared intelligence from the entire company and its extended network, versus just an individual’s perspective. </p>\n\n<p>Recognized by venture capitalists, tech companies and the media as a top recruiting services firm in the Bay Area, Riviera provides the reach and relationships of a large search organization with the feel of a specialized, boutique provider. Industry veterans Michael A. Morell and Ali Behnam founded the firm in 2002.
