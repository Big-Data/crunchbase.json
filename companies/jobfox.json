Jobfox&#8217;s intelligent job-fit technology uses this data to provide the best matches between individuals and their potential employers. Built-in widgets enable candidates to easily share their Jobfox Pages on other social networking sites such as MySpace. Jobfox has a no scam policy that ensures fraudulent companies are not included in their listings. This &#8216;Jobfox scam&#8217; policy is a key differentiator that separates Jobfox from many other free career sites that promote fake work-from-home jobs and degree scams.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Jobfox offers better communication to job seekers. Their Resume Tracker sends a mobile text message to individuals any time their resume has been viewed by an employer. Furthermore, Jobfox candidates can opt to share their online instant messaging availability with prospective employers. </p>\n\n<p>Jobfox competes directly with job search sites <a
