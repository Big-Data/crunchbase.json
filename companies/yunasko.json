In the same time, ultracapacitors can store quite high values of specific energy, greater than conventional non double layer capacitors. </p>\n\n<p>Ultracapacitors can be used as a stand-alone system or as an ultracapacitor-battery combination. In the latter case, ultracapacitors substantially increase the battery efficiency and operation life. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the main applications for the ultracapacitors include: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Transport (hybrid vehicles/buses, kinetic energy recuperation systems (kers), start stop systems etc); </li>\n<li>Industry (cranes, forklifts, welding machines); </li>\n<li>Energy Supply and Alternative Energy (power grids, UPS, wind-mills etc); </li>\n<li>Consumer electronics (hand tools, flash lights etc). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Presently, YUNASKO ultracapacitors possess world-best specific characteristics in terms of power and energy, leaving far behind its closest competitors. At this point, YUNASKO is working hard towards increasing its production capabilities and entering the global market of ultracapacitors.\nYUNASKO Specialties</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0019/6953/196953v2-max-150x150.png"],[[240,132],"assets/images/resized/0019/6953/196953v2-max-250x250.png"],[[240,132],"assets/images/resized/0019/6953/196953v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vadim","last_name":"Utkin","permalink":"vadim-utkin","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London office","address1":"Suite 404, 324-326 Regent Street","address2":"","zip_code":"W1B 3HH","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Ukrainian office","address1":"General Naumov Str. 13","address2":"","zip_code":"03164","city":"Kyiv","state_code":null,"country_code":"UKR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
