everybody — regardless of which app, device or carrier they are using.</p>\n\n<p>The company offers a free-to-all social communication app for all of the major mobile platforms which integrates Facebook Chat, IM, and free and unlimited SMS text messaging to any phone, anywhere in the world, with support for free calls coming soon.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike other social messaging or VoIP apps, yuilop is able to offer free and full SMS functionality to any phone (and in the near future, free calls to mobiles and fixed lines) through being ad-supported and by employing gamification via yuilop’s unique points-based “energy” system which rewards users based on how they use the app.</p>\n\n<p>yuilop also offers a 2nd mobile phone number so that users can use the app as a fully-fledged cloud-based mobile service.</p>\n\n<p>yuilop is headquartered in Barcelona, Spain, and raised 1 million euros in seed funding from Nauta Capital in Dec 2010.</p>\n\n<p>The company is founded by telecoms veterans and experienced entrepreneurs, including Jochen Doppelhammer who was previously CEO of KPN’s Spanish MVNO and led the mobile internet brand simyo to become the fastest growing and number one MVNO in Spain, and Tono Brusola who was previously responsible as CSO for KPN Spain’s partner business.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0012/5248/125248v7-max-150x150.png"],[[236,82],"assets/images/resized/0012/5248/125248v7-max-250x250.png"],[[236,82],"assets/images/resized/0012/5248/125248v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
