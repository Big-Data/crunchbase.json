JogHop wants to make exercise fun and create games for players of all ages. </p>\n\n<p>Our first game, FitQuest is available for free on the app store. Players need to jog in place to help a baby squirrel reach the tree house, they need to jump over snakes, duck under eagles and avoid other obstacles. </p>\n\n<p>FitQuest can be played in hotel rooms, before boarding a plane, while watching TV, on a rainy day, alone or with friends and family.</p>\n\n<p>From our players: </p>\n\n<p>â€œLove this App. canâ€™t get my iPod back from my daughter &#8230; she loves itâ€ - Jelena</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This is great for taking breaks at work (I work at home, so only my cats stared at me like I was crazy) or keeping the kids occupied.
