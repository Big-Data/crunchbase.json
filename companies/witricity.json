The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. </p>\n\n<p>Prof. SoljaÄiÄ‡&#8217;s team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This â€œstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  </p>\n\n<p>Prof. SoljaÄiÄ‡ was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship (also known as â€œGenius Grantâ€) in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  In addition, his work was recognized as one of the â€œTop Ten Emerging Technologies for 2008â€ by Technology Review, â€œTop 100 Science Stories of 2007â€ by Discover Magazine, and cited in The New York Times Magazine: â€œThe Year in Ideas â€“ 2007.â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,32],"assets/images/resized/0004/6816/46816v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,32],"assets/images/resized/0004/6816/46816v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,32],"assets/images/resized/0004/6816/46816v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.innoeco.com/2008/10/update-on-witricity-wireless-power.html","source_description":"An Update on WiTricity, the Wireless Power Company","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Stata Venture Partners","permalink":"stata-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0004/7969/47969v1-max-150x150.png"],[[154,88],"assets/images/resized/0004/7969/47969v1-max-250x250.png"],[[154,88],"assets/images/resized/0004/7969/47969v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Argonaut Partners","permalink":"argonaut-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0004/6830/46830v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/6830/46830v1-max-250x250.png"],[[387,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/6830/46830v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"80 Coolidge Hill Rd.","address2":"","zip_code":"02472","city":"Watertown","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.3676212,"longitude":-71.1516791}],"milestones":[{"description":"working with car battery maker Delphi Automotive LLC to develop automatic charging products for hybrid and electric vehicles","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":29,"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2010/09/27/daily37-WiTricity-working-with-Delphi-on-wireless-car-charger.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"WiTricity working with Delphi on wireless car charger","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"WiTricity","permalink":"witricity"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0004/6817/46817v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,128],"assets/images/resized/0004/6817/46817v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,230],"assets/images/resized/0004/6817/46817v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
