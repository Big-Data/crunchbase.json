Purchasers can choose between crates curated by the Lost Crates team or by its Partners in Design, and may sign up for as many different crate themes as they like.</p>\n\n<p>The company currently offers three crates curated by the Lost Crates team (Stationery, Petite Stationery, and Angie&#8217;s Picks) as well as eight curated by its blog partners (Man Repeller, Joy the Baker, Gluten Free Girl, Inspired By Charm, Design Milk, Better Living Through Design, EcoSalon, and The Shiksa). Crates include items that complement each other and bring a little design into members’ daily lives. Subscriptions can also be purchased as gifts, and items from the different crates may be purchased a la carte in the Lost Crates Shop.</p>\n\n<p>Lost Crates was founded in March 2011 by Danny Levi and Millie Tadewaldt. In February 2012, the company, which was previously a stationery-only service, underwent a relaunch to feature more options and to appeal to a wider audience. In June 2012, the team welcomed Jack Wheeler as General Manager.</p>\n\n<p>Lost Crates is backed by Chicago-based venture capital firm and startup foundry <a href=\"http://www.sandboxindustries.com\" title=\"Sandbox Industries\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sandbox Industries</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0013/1823/131823v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0013/1823/131823v2-max-250x250.png"],[[396,85],"assets/images/resized/0013/1823/131823v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Levi","permalink":"danny-levi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Millie","last_name":"Tadewaldt","permalink":"millie-tadewaldt","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0013/6022/136022v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0013/6022/136022v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0013/6022/136022v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager","person":{"first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Wheeler","permalink":"jack-wheeler","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"60607","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0018/5558/185558v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0018/5558/185558v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0018/5558/185558v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
