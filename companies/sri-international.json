SRI, which was founded by Stanford University as Stanford Research Institute in 1946 and became independent in 1970, has been meeting the strategic needs of clients and partners for more than 60 years. Perhaps best known for its invention of the computer mouse and interactive computing, SRI has also been responsible for major advances in networking and communications, robotics, drug discovery and development, advanced materials, atmospheric research, education research, economic development, national security, and more. The nonprofit institute performs sponsored research and development for government agencies, businesses, and foundations. SRI also licenses its technologies, forms strategic alliances, and creates spin-off companies. In 2009, SRI&#8217;s consolidated revenues, including its wholly owned for-profit subsidiary, Sarnoff Corporation, were approximately $470 million. Sarnoff Corporation, a leader in vision, video, and semiconductor innovations, will be fully integrated into SRI effective January 1, 2011.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[137,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/7300/67300v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[137,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/7300/67300v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[137,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/7300/67300v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP
