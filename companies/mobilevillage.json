MobileVillage accomplishes this by fostering education and alliances through &#8220;Best of Breed&#8221; solution identification, event partnerships, events, an online industry directory, daily online news, its widely respected &#8220;Go Mobile&#8221;™ newsletter, a Mobile Mentors™ program, and popular annual Mobile Star Awards™ program. </p>\n\n<p>For 11 years running, the Mobile Star Awards (http://www.mobilevillage.com/mobilestarawards) has honored the best mobile products, success stories, and visionaries. In the process, it&#8217;s helped to make winners out of many relatively unknown mobile companies. A major standout feature of the Mobile Star Awards is that there are no paid analysts or reviewers to judge the entrants.  Instead, three or more winners in each category are chosen by readers of MobileVillage&#8217;s free, biweekly, &#8220;Go Mobile&#8221; email newsletter. Nominations and entries in the 2012 Mobile Star Awards are being accepted through December 1, 2012.</p>\n\n<p>MobileVillage is also seeking ongoing sponsors and community collaborators. All sponsors are encouraged to become active leaders and mentors in MobileVillage community.
