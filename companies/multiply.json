The service started life as a social networking site in 2004, bringing innovations such as the news feed to the industry, but has evolved into the purest example of social shopping on the web today. The shops, the products, the transactions, and of course, the buyers, all live within the Multiply ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Multiply&#8217;s ecommerce platform offers sellers a combination of ecommerce and social communications tools that can not be found on any other site.</p>\n\n<p>Multiply was acquired by Naspers in the fall of 2010, and is headquartered in Jakarta with an additional office in
