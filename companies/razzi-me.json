Instead of taking all of the ad revenue like other photo sharing sites, Razzi shares its ad revenue with the users. This model opens a new lucrative revenue stream for celebrities and professional photographers.</p>\n\n<p>Razzi has a streamlined interface that keeps the site easy to use in a feature-rich environment. Unlimited uploads, privacy control, sharing options (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr), drag and drop photo/album editor, and original file access are some of the features available. In Razzi&#8217;s independent social network environment, users can view their friends&#8217; activity and interact through commenting, private messaging, and liking photos.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2011, <a href=\"http://razzi.me/iphone\" title=\"Razzi for iOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">Razzi for iOS</a> was released. This app includes the following features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Professional photo filters</li>\n<li>Upload multiple files at once (works in the background)</li>\n<li>View your (and your friends&#8217;) photos, albums, and likes</li>\n<li>Like other users&#8217; photos</li>\n<li>Explore Razzi (featured and recent photos)</li>\n<li>Manage your friendships</li>\n<li>Share photos with Facebook and Twitter</li>\n<li>Download photos to your device</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Independent self-funded Orlando-based business.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0013/2410/132410v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0013/2410/132410v4-max-250x250.png"],[[432,167],"assets/images/resized/0013/2410/132410v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Himler","permalink":"robert-himler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/3815/133815v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/3815/133815v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/3815/133815v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Fussy","permalink":"michael-fussy","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Flickr","permalink":"flickr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0021/3864/213864v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,30],"assets/images/resized/0021/3864/213864v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,30],"assets/images/resized/0021/3864/213864v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"SmugMug","permalink":"smugmug","image":{"available_sizes":[[[1,1],"assets/images/resized/0000/2539/2539v1-max-150x150.png"],[[1,1],"assets/images/resized/0000/2539/2539v1-max-250x250.png"],[[1,1],"assets/images/resized/0000/2539/2539v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Photobucket, Corp.","permalink":"ontela","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0002/1122/21122v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/1122/21122v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1122/21122v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Storage","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Amazon Web Services","permalink":"amazon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3938/23938v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Orlando","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0016/1854/161854v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0016/1854/161854v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,394],"assets/images/resized/0016/1854/161854v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0016/1855/161855v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0016/1855/161855v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,394],"assets/images/resized/0016/1855/161855v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1856/161856v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/1856/161856v2-max-250x250.png"],[[361,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/1856/161856v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://razzi.me/tour","title":"Razzi Tour"},{"external_url":"http://razzi.me/RazziDemo/photos","title":"Razzi Demo Account"}]}
