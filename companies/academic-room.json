The platform also dramatically reduces time to locate, both, credible scholarship and experts within a field of research.  Academic Room was a finalist in 2012 Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX) Awards for its ability to harness and broker resources and talent across its open communities.  Academic Room is headquartered in the Harvard Innovation Lab.</p>\n\n<p>Access to educational knowledge, along with the process of its discovery, is an intractable problem, resulting in 3.7 billion related searches every month.  “Researchers—be they senior scholars or freshmen—no longer make the library the first stop in their search for knowledge. The shift from producing and consuming information in hard copy to multimedia digital form has moved the center of information gravity from research libraries to the Internet.”  Search engine algorithms rank content that has gone through search engine optimization (SEO) making it more difficult to find more specific high quality academic content. To make matters worse, academic content is becoming increasingly complex and varied, posing an enormous challenge to organize it within traditional web portals.  Given these limitations, not surprisingly, the delivery of content occurs haphazardly through disparate websites that often have little to do with education.  For instance, today’s students and professors must scour library catalogs for books; video sites for lectures; journal databases for articles and reviews; job boards for career opportunities; and search engines for content such as bibliographies, data sets, lecture notes, syllabi and past exams.  As research increasingly becomes interdisciplinary, there is a pressing need for a platform that is social and facilitates both permanent curation and discovery of knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Academic Room’s knowledge management capabilities bring order to this chaos by providing the technology and semantic framework to organize content—in all its complexity—into well-defined subject areas. Because raw and published content is no longer scattered, but rather curated in one central location within specialized social communities on the platform, there emerge a number of opportunities to build a meaningful ecosystem of services around academic disciplines.  In addition, Academic Room provides single-search discovery of relevant content in all formats (article, book, review, video, audio, image, bibliography, syllabus, dissertation, manuscript) to granular levels.  By adding a social networking layer to the platform, content producers and consumers—whether institutions or individuals—are able to create their profiles, dynamically update content they have authored, and engage with other users in discussion groups and blogs.  Academic Room was conceived as a content platform with the larger vision of collaboration in mind from its very inception because other existing solutions are mere social networks that lack the capability to create structured repositories of knowledge.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7330/197330v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7330/197330v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[347,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/7330/197330v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Harpreet","last_name":"Singh","permalink":"harpreet-singh-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sarabjot","last_name":"Kaur","permalink":"sarabjot-kaur","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"184 Green Street","address2":"Suite 1","zip_code":"02139","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0019/7329/197329v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,129],"assets/images/resized/0019/7329/197329v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,232],"assets/images/resized/0019/7329/197329v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bostinno.com/2012/05/09/meet-the-2012-mitx-doing-good-innovation-awards-finalists/","title":"Academic Room Finalist in 2012 MITX Innovation Awards"}]}
