The two core products, Scarab Enterprise and Scarab Cloud (a cloud computing implementation of the recommender engine) are now used by a number of online vendors, from small webshops to large customers such as New Yorkâ€™s largest online grocery delivery service FreshDirect.</p>\n\n<p>Scarab Research has accumulated considerable expertise working with very large amounts of data. Scarab has well-established and highly efficient processes, methods and tools to handle a range of tasks including data analysis and data mining, log analysis, working with click based event logs, behavioral analysis and profiling.</p>\n\n<p>It is a core feature of our technology to mine several relations in multiple layers of data, facilitating non-trivial exploitation of catalogs and metadata. This empowers businesses to uncover hidden structures and relationships in their data and produce various levels of recommendations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/6131/96131v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0009/6131/96131v2-max-250x250.png"],[[276,61],"assets/images/resized/0009/6131/96131v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Viktor","last_name":"SzathmÃ¡ry","permalink":"viktor-szathmry","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Ãkos","last_name":"MarÃ³y","permalink":"kos-mary","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Science Officer","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Fogaras, Ph.D.","permalink":"daniel-fogarasi-ph-d","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Science Officer","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"IstvÃ¡n HernÃ¡dvÃ¶lgyi","permalink":"dr-istvn-herndvlgyi","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Sales and Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"Androczky","permalink":"gabriel-androczky","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/1519/111519v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[216,218],"assets/images/resized/0011/1519/111519v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[216,218],"assets/images/resized/0011/1519/111519v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of International Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Ilona","last_name":"Budapesti","permalink":"ilona-budapesti","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"New Yorkâ€™s largest online grocery retailer, FreshDirect.com, has adopted Scarabâ€™s Enterprise Solution.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"http://www.scarabresearch.com/2010/08/05/nys-largest-online-grocer-adopts-scarab-recommender/","source_text":null,"source_description":"NYâ€™s largest online grocer adopts Scarab recommender","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Scarab Research","permalink":"scarab-research"}},{"description":"Scarabâ€™s newest offering, the Scarab Cloud, is a software-as-a-service solution focusing on small and medium sized companies.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":20,"source_url":"http://www.scarabresearch.com/2010/07/20/proudly-presenting-scarab-cloud/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Proudly presenting Scarab Cloud","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Scarab Research","permalink":"scarab-research"}},{"description":"Recommender technology startup Scarab Research today announced it has appointed former Google project leader DÃ¡niel Fogaras, Ph.D. as its Chief Science Officer, while former CSO leaves to join Google.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"http://www.scarabresearch.com/2010/11/15/google-and-scarab-exchanges-researchers/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Google and Scarab exchanges researchers","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Scarab Research","permalink":"scarab-research"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
