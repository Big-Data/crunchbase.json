As a user of InsideTrip, you can indicate which of these pain points are most important to you and the serviceâ€™s algorithms will generate a unique TripQuality score for each ticket result. These can be used in conjunction with the ticket price to find just the right itinerary.</p>\n\n<p>InsideTrip has collected information about the quality of trips from a variety of sources, including the Transportation Security Administration, airlines, and airline websites. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,107],"assets/images/resized/0001/4280/14280v1-max-150x150.png"],[[142,107],"assets/images/resized/0001/4280/14280v1-max-250x250.png"],[[142,107],"assets/images/resized/0001/4280/14280v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"InsideTrip","permalink":"insidetrip","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Pelter","permalink":"dave-pelter","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"KAYAK","permalink":"kayak","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/2791/2791v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0000/2791/2791v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0000/2791/2791v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mobissimo","permalink":"mobissimo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/2794/2794v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/2794/2794v2-max-250x250.png"],[[306,76],"assets/images/resized/0000/2794/2794v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"HotelsOutlook.com","permalink":"hotelsoutlook-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
