If more than three separate bloggers identify one marketer as targeting them irrelevantly, that person&#8217;s account will be frozen and they will be unable to access the blog database for a period of time, giving the bloggabase.com team the chance to contact them to get to the bottom of the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Bloggers are given the opportunity to request information and get free review offers, by making it clear to all what they will write about, what they won&#8217;t write about and whether they&#8217;re happy to be contacted or not. Each blogger will have a bloggabase.com profile, giving marketers the opportunity to see the blog’s unique visitors, SEO value, recent entries and areas of interest.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Barr","permalink":"andy-barr","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rich","last_name":"Leigh","permalink":"rich-leigh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0019/6171/196171v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0019/6171/196171v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,395],"assets/images/resized/0019/6171/196171v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
