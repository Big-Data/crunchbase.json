The house of Mark Twain, the BrontÃ« sisters, Thackeray, Dickens, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Maurice Sendak, Shel Silverstein, and Margaret Wise Brown, HarperCollins was founded in New York City in 1817 as J. and J. Harper, later Harper &amp; Brothers, by James and John Harper. In 1987, as Harper &amp; Row, it was acquired by News Corporation. </p>\n\n<p>The worldwide book group was formed following News Corporationâ€™s 1990 acquisition of the British publisher William Collins &amp; Sons. Founded in 1819, William Collins &amp; Sons published a range of Bibles, atlases, dictionaries, and reissued classics, expanding over the years to include legendary authors, such as H. G. Wells, Agatha Christie, J. R. R. Tolkien, and C. S. Lewis. HarperCollins has publishing groups in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia/New Zealand, and India. </p>\n\n<p>Today, HarperCollins is a broad-based publisher with strengths in literary and commercial fiction, business books, childrenâ€™s books, cookbooks, and mystery, romance, reference, religious, and spiritual books. Consistently at the forefront of innovation and technological advancement, HarperCollins is the first publisher to digitize its content and create a global digital warehouse to protect the rights of its authors, meet consumer demand, and generate additional business opportunities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0007/4743/74743v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0007/4743/74743v1-max-250x250.png"],[[365,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/4743/74743v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"FSB Associates","permalink":"fsb-associates","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0003/8782/38782v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0003/8782/38782v2-max-250x250.png"],[[436,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/8782/38782v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"title":"Public Relations","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Walker Sands Communications","permalink":"walker-sands-communications","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0021/5854/215854v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0021/5854/215854v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,98],"assets/images/resized/0021/5854/215854v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
