EBS technology is based on a non-invasive brain stimulation deploying weak electrical currents. Thus, functional deficits after stroke or brain trauma can be treated in neurological patients. Low-voltage electrical pulses are administered at frequencies and amplitudes identified as optimal for each patient, allowing the brain to â€˜re-learnâ€™ its natural synchronization with the help of an external â€˜metronomeâ€™ facilitating functional rehabilitation in the domains of speech, vision, memory and mobility. The company benefits from more than 15 years of research and clinical experience with more than 1,000 patients. Observational studies show that partial restoration of brain function after brain damage can be achieved in a relatively short period of time. EBS Technologies currently has six employees and collaborates with several R&amp;D institutions and development partners.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2010/01/germany-ebs-technology-completes-3m.html","source_description":"Germany, EBS Technology Completes â‚¬3m Series B Financing Round","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Earlybird Verwaltung GmbH","permalink":"earlybird-verwaltung-gmbh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0006/1379/61379v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,28],"assets/images/resized/0006/1379/61379v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[189,28],"assets/images/resized/0006/1379/61379v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Kleinmachnow","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
