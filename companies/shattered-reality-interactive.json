The big original vision was to create a theme based Massive Multiplayer Online Game that could be played in 5-10 minute time increments anytime, from anywhere.Â </p>\n\n<p>Today popular online games, like World of Warcraft and Everquest, allow players to explore large and vast fantasy worlds, however they require huge time commitments and are considered &#8220;isolated&#8221; in their walled gardens. The games created by Shattered Reality provide &#8220;theme-based&#8221; and â€œhit-basedâ€ accomplishment for both the hardcore and casual gamers. Whatâ€™s great about us is that we leverage the hardcore gaming production values and bridge the gap for online social games. </p>\n\n<p>The first title to be released is, Legends of Kaos (LoK), a free 2 play multiplayer ancient sci-fi fantasy that combines the head-to-head play, collectability and trading associated with virtual powers and collectible action items. We also leverage level advancement and character development of massively multi-player games (MMORPGs) with the ease of access and community aspects of Web â€œtwo-point-ohâ€ applications. LoK will also be available on Facebook and Myspace. LoK and other games developed by Shattered Reality are free 2 play. Players have the option to trade or sell items to other players and they can even sign up for VIP memberships for a small subscription fee.Â </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0002/4060/24060v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0002/4060/24060v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,369],"assets/images/resized/0002/4060/24060v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Bo","last_name":"Lasater","permalink":"bo-lasater","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Matthews","permalink":"steve-matthews","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Pham","permalink":"peter-pham-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Damon","last_name":"Grow","permalink":"damon-grow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0011/2784/112784v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0011/2784/112784v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,415],"assets/images/resized/0011/2784/112784v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Vivendi Universal","permalink":"vivendiuniversal","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/5925/65925v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[152,38],"assets/images/resized/0006/5925/65925v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[152,38],"assets/images/resized/0006/5925/65925v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Electronic Arts","permalink":"electronicarts","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/2250/12250v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,158],"assets/images/resized/0001/2250/12250v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[425,270],"assets/images/resized/0001/2250/12250v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Zynga","permalink":"zynga","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/3187/3187v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0000/3187/3187v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[275,92],"assets/images/resized/0000/3187/3187v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Challenge Games","permalink":"challenge-games","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/2860/2860v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/2860/2860v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[166,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/2860/2860v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Blizzard Entertainment","permalink":"blizzard-entertainment","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7564/27564v1-max-150x150.png"],[[102,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7564/27564v1-max-250x250.png"],[[102,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7564/27564v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":12,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"490 2nd Street","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.783046,"longitude":-122.394067}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/9izNyQ2G4R0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"320\" height=\"255\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed> ","description":"<p>tc50</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
