It matters because good technique can improve performance and make running fun again. It also matters because bad technique, such as excessive heel striking, often leads to injury.</p>\n\n<p>We know that to improve something you need a steady stream of personalized advice and feedback. You need someone to watch how you are actually moving and suggest ways to improve, like a good coach. Runnr.me does just that. It measures and understands your movement using wearable sensors and gives you live feedback on your technique so you can improve.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0019/3875/193875v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0019/3875/193875v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,210],"assets/images/resized/0019/3875/193875v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Pop","permalink":"andrei-pop","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Graeham","last_name":"Douglas","permalink":"graeham-douglas","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
