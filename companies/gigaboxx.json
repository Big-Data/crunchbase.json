This then enables them to sell direct to their audience (using a suite of marketing tools), by delivering their site URL (web address) direct to the live audienceâ€™s mobile phones â€“ at the point when they are most likely to make an impulse purchase. </p>\n\n<p>Mobile stores, which were designed specifically with the music industry in mind, are quickly produced and managed, via a user-friendly online wizard.  The artist or record companies can then add tracks, videos, gig lists and much more. This is all achieved without incurring the expense of an application, which might only work on a specific make and model of smart phone. Gigaboxx believe that in order for bands to effectively reach an audience and sell product, they must cater for the majority of all phone users, rather than targeting a specific group though just applications. So the Gigaboxx system works across all mobile platforms, delivering the best user experience possible.</p>\n\n<p>The system also empowers bands to deliver unique content and control how that content is delivered. Changing content is now in the hands of the record company or artist.</p>\n\n<p>Included in the standard package is a direct-2-audience marketing tool set. This includes QR codes and a SMS reply service. An artist can print both the QR code and short code numbers on all their promotional material, plus post them to all their favourite social network communities and blogs, dragging an audience back into their Gigaboxx mobile site. </p>\n\n<p>Gigaboxx also supplies and sells local Wifi and Bluetooth solutions, which detect a fanâ€™s phone with their Bluetooth or Wifi enabled, and then transmit the site URL.</p>\n\n<p>Fans can make a purchase there and then through an all new one click micro payment system called Payforit, which is compatible with all mobile phones and is supported by all the major phone networks. Downloads are billed direct to a fans mobile phone bill, or deducted from their pay-as-you-go credit. </p>\n\n<p>Gigaboxx is also able to give artists/record companies a valuable insight into their fan base via the data and analytics collected from download sales.</p>\n\n<p>The team behind Gigaboxx include music biz veteran Hugh Stanley-Clarke, whose CV begins with booking punk bands at the legendary Roxy club in London in the 70s, through A&amp;R work with legends like Stranglers, Kate Bush and Iron Maiden.  A passionate and long-time champion of live music and new talent, he was also the man responsible for signing â€“ among many others â€“ Marillion, Thomas Dolby and Naked Eyes.</p>\n\n<p>â€œWeâ€™ve made the process as straight forward and user-friendly as possible,â€ he says.  â€œItâ€™s the flexibility and control you get over your content using the Gigaboxx platform that makes it so exciting. You can change content on the fly - itâ€™s immediate. Meaning artists/record labels can now upload different videos and remixes, depending on the historic geographic data build up using the system. For example a re-mixes EP for Manchester or a unique video remix for Bristol. They can also sell single tracks, albums, images and merchandise â€“ and of course itâ€™s fully sync-able with platforms like Facebook and Twitter.â€</p>\n\n<p>The service will cost just Â£14.95 per month on a short 30 day rolling contract.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢Â Gigaboxx delivers direct to the consumer, from the seller, using a combination of QR code, SMS short code, Wireless and Bluetooth technologies</p>\n\n<p>â€¢Â Gigaboxx Sends directly to fansâ€™ mobile phones, which are rapidly becoming the UKâ€™s favorite music device. According to market research company GFK, more than 44 million mobile phones with MP3 capacity were sold in the UK over the last two years.

It enables artists to build their own mobile phone sites so they can sell their music and merchandise and interact with their audience at live events</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Gigaboxx delivers real time data and statistics for record companies and artists to increase sales and have direct contact with their fanbase</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Gigaboxx   creates the opportunity to market directly to a live audience and receive instant feedback</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Gigaboxx makes it possible to instantly adapt your site and content to the real time data you receive from your gigs â€“ for example different re-mixes, mixes and videos based on the regional preferences of your fans</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Gigaboxx allows managers and artists to plan tour strategies armed with new insights into their fans behavioural patterns</p>\n\n<p>â€¢Â Gigaboxx integrates with other mobile social networks and feeds</p>\n\n<p>â€¢Â Gigaboxx has dual delivery, so a download can also be collected online through a web browser on a desktop computer.
