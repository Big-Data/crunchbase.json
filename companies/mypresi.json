On demand, it’s available for anyone to view whenever it suits them.</p>\n\n<p>How does it work?</p>\n\n<p>It’s cloud-based so there’s no need to install anything, it all happens in your browser. You upload your content (slides, photos, document) and record yourself presenting into your webcam, clicking through your slides as you go. When you’ve finished, click publish and you can share with anyone, anywhere. They can then watch your presentme whenever and as often as they like.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/6503/96503v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0009/6503/96503v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,99],"assets/images/resized/0009/6503/96503v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Spencer","last_name":"Lambert","permalink":"spencer-lambert","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Marshfield","permalink":"mike-marshfield","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London Office","address1":"G18.1 Shepherds East","address2":"Richmond Way","zip_code":"W14 0DQ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
