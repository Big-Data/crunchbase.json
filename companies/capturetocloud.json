What resulted is a cloud-based service capable of capturing any digital content, organizing this content into shareable collections and enabling easy collaboration around content.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the vast wealth of information on the Internet, CaptureToCloud first needed to revolutionize the way web content is captured. The team built an easy-to-use, but very advanced solution that captures live web pages. The importance of “live” web pages is that all formatting and links are preserved – in fact, it’s the HTML that’s captured and remains editable. CaptureToCloud then deployed this solution on mobile devices making it the first solution ever to capture live webpages while browsing on a mobile device. In addition to web content, the team added integration with Google Drive and Dropbox. Finally, desktop file drag and drop was added. With all of this work completed, any form of content from virtually any source can now be added to the CaptureToCloud workspace.</p>\n\n<p>CaptureToCloud then tackled the next phase – allowing you to share your workspace with all the right people. With social network sharing prevalent in many people’s lives, the CaptureToCloud workspace went “social” with sharing options for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Google+. In addition, CaptureToCloud added personal links – a live link to any collection for broad sharing with anyone. Extensive email integration for notifications and messaging was also designed into the workspace.</p>\n\n<p>The final phase of CaptureToCloud’s evolution was live collaboration. Designed for professionals and their teams, a live activity stream enables document and collection level discussions with comments, sticky notes and activity tracks.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0020/0370/200370v1-max-150x150.png"],[[162,60],"assets/images/resized/0020/0370/200370v1-max-250x250.png"],[[162,60],"assets/images/resized/0020/0370/200370v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ramon","last_name":"Nuñez","permalink":"ramon-nuez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"Lilyquist","permalink":"laura-lilyquist","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Apfelberg","permalink":"steve-apfelberg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/2356/92356v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/2356/92356v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/2356/92356v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Steve Apfelberg / <a href=\"http://www.yammer.com\" title=\"Yammer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yammer</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/07/capturetocloud-raisea-4-7m-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"CaptureToCloud Raises $4.7M in Funding","raised_amount":4700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":11,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Acero Capital","permalink":"acero-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0020/0535/200535v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,227],"assets/images/resized/0020/0535/200535v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,409],"assets/images/resized/0020/0535/200535v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"Investors","permalink":"angel-investors-4","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"226 Airport Parkway","address2":" Suite 600","zip_code":"95110","city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1318/201318v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1318/201318v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1318/201318v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1319/201319v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1319/201319v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1319/201319v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1320/201320v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1320/201320v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1320/201320v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1321/201321v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1321/201321v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1321/201321v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1322/201322v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1322/201322v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1322/201322v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1323/201323v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1323/201323v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1323/201323v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0022/0457/220457v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0022/0457/220457v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0022/0457/220457v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://cloudtimes.org/2012/07/26/introducing-capture-to-cloud-content-sharing/","title":"Introducing Capture-to-Cloud Content Sharing"},{"external_url":"http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2012/07/12/capture-to-cloud-raises-4M-dollars.html","title":"CaptureToCloud snags $4.7M for content sharing platform"},{"external_url":"http://financial.tmcnet.com/topics/financial-technology/articles/298553-capturetocloud-closes-series-funding.htm","title":"CaptureToCloud Closes Series A Funding"},{"external_url":"http://www.zdnet.com/capturetocloud-debuts-social-collaboration-tool-targets-smbs-7000000707/","title":"CaptureToCloud debuts social collaboration tool;
