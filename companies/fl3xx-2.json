It includes real-time booking, auto-scheduling of aircraft and crew, schedule optimization, safety compliance, as well as flight tracking, pre-flight and post-flight data logs. The system is entirely designed and coded internally and is based on open platforms. The core technology is based on multi-agents: multiple interacting intelligent agents. The agents can solve scheduling problems for a fleet of 100 aircraft in less than 1 second. FL3XX is a web application, accessible with all web browsers as well as iPhone and iPad.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0014/0543/140543v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0014/0543/140543v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,142],"assets/images/resized/0014/0543/140543v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"FL3XX","permalink":"fl3xx","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Paolo","last_name":"Sommariva","permalink":"paolo-sommariva","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"Oberender","permalink":"stefan-oberender","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/6383/166383v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/6383/166383v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[264,345],"assets/images/resized/0016/6383/166383v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Dannegger","permalink":"christian-dannegger","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Travico","permalink":"travico","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Leon","permalink":"leon","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Seagil","permalink":"seagil","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"CTA
