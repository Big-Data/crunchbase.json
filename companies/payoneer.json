Payoneer is a privately-held company and a registered MSP with MasterCard.</p>\n\n<p>Payment recipients 18 years or older can order a card by filling out a form online on a Payoneer partner website.  When a card is first received (through the mail), it needs to be activated for security reasons.  Once loaded, it can be used for purchases or cash withdrawals just like any other MasterCard card and can be used anywhere debit MasterCard is accepted. Cardholders and others who have the cardholder&#8217;s email address or the card number can load anywhere from $20 to $1000 per day onto the Payoneer card.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.payoneer.com/pricing.aspx\" title=\"Fees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fees</a> associated with owning a card may vary according to the Payoneer partner.  Activation may requires a one time fee, &#8220;monthly maintenance&#8221; may cost you up to $3/month plus conversion fees for any money you withdraw in local currencies.  Once a card has a zero balance for 60 days it&#8217;s automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n<p>Payoneer offers their business customers a co-branded MasterCard.  Among their over 1000 clients are <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/odesk\" title=\"oDesk\">oDesk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/amiestreet\" title=\"Amie Street\">Amie Street</a> and <a href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com\" title=\"iStockphoto\" rel=\"nofollow\">iStockphoto</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The company is headquartered in New York with R&amp;D offices in Tel-Aviv, Israel.  They work with Choice Bank and First Covenant Bank to issue and process cards.
