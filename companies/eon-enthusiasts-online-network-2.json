Along with several high profile properties such as FordTruckWorld.com, MustangLife.com, DodgeTruckWorld.com, and a dozen others, EON inherited a substantial organic traffic base. </p>\n\n<p>Now, in their second year, EON has refined their base software significantly and is rolling out 30 additional non-automotive related web properties ranging in interests from pet enthusiasts to a community site for horror film buffs. Among the enhancements to the original code are community event calendars, self organizing chapters, photo rating systems, buddy lists, dynamic presentation module that exposes more of the content as it is populated, and an internal email system. </p>\n\n<p>They are strong in the community software segment and have begun talks to white label their software. By leveraging an extremely loyal traffic base, EON is able to expand into new markets inexpensively and organically. </p>\n\n<p>The organization is small and largely virtual. Key players in the organization are Peter J Tyrrell, CEO and Robert Tuxbury acting as CTO and EVP. The company is well funded by undisclosed investment partners.  </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Demand Media","permalink":"demandmedia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0000/0247/247v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/0247/247v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0000/0247/247v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"VerticalScope","permalink":"verticalscope-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0006/4899/64899v1-max-150x150.png"],[[151,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/4899/64899v1-max-250x250.png"],[[151,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/4899/64899v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
