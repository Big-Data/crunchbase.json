That is to say it&#8217;s also a platform by which anyone and everyone can fund and support healthcare projects, startups, and innovations that improve healthcare and help people live longer, better lives. </p>\n\n<p>MedStartr is powered by an all-or-nothing funding method where projects must be fully-funded or no money changes hands. This makes it so you have no obligations either way if critical mass is not achieved to get to your minimum viable product or to get your existing product to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>Successful projects to date have included MedStartr itself, a few consumer products, a medical mission to the Dominican Republic, one SaaS application for healthcare, a support group for a rare disease, a conference called &#8220;Partnership with Patients&#8221;, and two new medical devices. Companies have raised over $50,000 on the site and over 3M off the site in the first 90 days.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0020/0362/200362v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0020/0362/200362v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,136],"assets/images/resized/0020/0362/200362v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
