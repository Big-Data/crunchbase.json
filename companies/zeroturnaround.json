The company is the creator of JRebel, an award-winning Java development productivity tool.\nJRebel a JVM plugin that eliminates the build and redeploy phases of the J2E development cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Based on a survey completed in  2010 from over 1100 J2E developers, it was discovered that between 10 - 23% of each development hour is spent on turnaround. </p>\n\n<p>Turnaround is the time it takes for the changes in code to propagate to the running application. It includes build time, deploy time and initialization time.</p>\n\n<p>JRebel monitors Java classes and reloads the changes in real-time without restarting your application or losing any state. It does not require a debug mode and, unlike built-in JVM HotSwap, supports class schema changes like adding methods or fields.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0002/9877/29877v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0002/9877/29877v2-max-250x250.png"],[[315,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/9877/29877v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"JRebel","permalink":"javarebel","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jevgeni","last_name":"Kabanov","permalink":"jevgeni-kabanov","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/2453/32453v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/2453/32453v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/2453/32453v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Ragne Kabanova</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & COO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Laats","permalink":"alex-laats","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Toomas","last_name":"Römer","permalink":"toomas-rmer","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Booth","permalink":"david-booth","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$380k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":380000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Tartu","address1":"Ãœlikooli 2","address2":"","zip_code":"51003","city":"Tartu","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":58.3820542,"longitude":26.731054},{"description":"Tallinn","address1":"Narva mnt 7d","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Tallinn","state_code":null,"country_code":"EST","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Prague","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Prague","state_code":null,"country_code":"CZE","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Boston","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/10/javarebel","title":"JavaRebel: Dynamic Classloading in the JVM"}]}
