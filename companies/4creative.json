The application geographically publishes and enables you to share any event or item at any venue and the cost, within or outside of your immediate community.</p>\n\n<p>GoDutch also aims to change the way that merchants use advertising to attract consumers. By bucking mainstream advertising mediums with bloated costs and unknown returns and leveraging the richly dominating mobile smartphone device market, GoDutch will provide merchants with DIY-like control through a slick socially connected Advertising application engine. This provides a simple but immediate choice outside of the typical street corner bed mattress clown and convoluted Ad channel ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in!\nWhat&#8217;s the first thing that comes to mind when you think “Go Dutch”?\n For the 6 co-founders at 4Creative Inc. it simply chained back to a term that a family member used when referring to their foray into dating = ‘ lets split the bill!’.\nThe possibilities exploded. \nFrom there it quickly developed into a mobile Application that offers users not only the ability to publish the cost of an event, but create an event that collectively reaches out to friends, establish a venue enriched with on device mapping, provide a timeframe, post a picture&#8230;  and GoDutch!\nAll the essential social networking features that give users a compelling experience. \nMost importantly, the Application provides the ability for users to broadcast an event to an to a broad and powerful social networking audience including Facebook, Twitter, email, SMS and push notifications on device with the ability for recipients to respond inside the Application alerting the creator &#8220;Who&#8217;s in&#8221;.\nAll of these rich eye appealing features come to you in a smooth flowing interface integrated on todays hottest mobile platforms (iPhone and Android) </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Borkenhagen","permalink":"chris-borkenhagen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO/co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Kramer","permalink":"justin-kramer","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Evite","permalink":"evite","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/1753/1753v3-max-150x150.png"],[[160,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/1753/1753v3-max-250x250.png"],[[160,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/1753/1753v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Doweet","permalink":"doweet-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,114],"assets/images/resized/0015/4506/154506v2-max-150x150.png"],[[114,114],"assets/images/resized/0015/4506/154506v2-max-250x250.png"],[[114,114],"assets/images/resized/0015/4506/154506v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Hotlist","permalink":"hotlist","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/3788/63788v10-max-150x150.png"],[[109,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/3788/63788v10-max-250x250.png"],[[109,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/3788/63788v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Holler","permalink":"holler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/8087/138087v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0013/8087/138087v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,214],"assets/images/resized/0013/8087/138087v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal Attorney representation","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cooley LLP ","permalink":"cooley-llp","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Redmond WA HQ","address1":"10102 163rd Ave NE","address2":"","zip_code":"98052","city":"Redmond","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/5460/165460v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/5460/165460v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/5460/165460v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.geekwire.com/2011/startup-spotlight-godutch-mobile-app","title":"GoDutch launch"}]}
