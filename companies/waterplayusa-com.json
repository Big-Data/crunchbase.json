Everyone loves to take a vacation, but how many actually get the full benefits of the time off? WaterplayUSA helps you plan your fun. They allow you to plan and book your activities prior to vacation so every minute you spend in your choice destination will be enjoyable and relaxing. WaterplayUSA has found the top activity providers throughout the nation and brought them to one single location. Whether you want to learn how to surf, go kiteboarding, take an afternoon booze cruise, or get out on the water to catch that big one; they have you covered.</p>\n\n<p>WaterplayUSA was formed in 2009 as a travel and tourism website that quickly became the nation’s largest Water Sports Directory connecting users to over 22,000 water activities such as fishing charters, jet ski rentals, and surf lessons. Whereas we have been a directory – WaterplayUSA has now developed the nation’s first “booking engine” specifically for water sports and other water-related recreational activities to help merge the online gap between water sports providers and their customers. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0007/6662/76662v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0007/6662/76662v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,135],"assets/images/resized/0007/6662/76662v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Pres.","person":{"first_name":"Will","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"will-smith","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"648 Village Park Dr.","address2":"Unit 303","zip_code":"28405","city":"Wilmington","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"WaterplayUSA.com, Americaâ€™s number 1 online water sports directory, was recently chosen as the 2010 â€œBest Informational Siteâ€ and â€œBest Overall Siteâ€ winner of DotNetNukeâ€™s worldwide website competition.
