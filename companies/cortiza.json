CORTIZA is born to let you take your notes to the web, where you can better organize them.</p>\n\n<p>CORTIZA has a very graphical UI allowing you to organize your notes in form of post-its. You can write or draw on them and then move, resize, joine or link them. </p>\n\n<p>Your notes can also be organized into tabs, allowing you to take control of the UI. You can also choose notes to be set as to-do elements, and weâ€™ll notify you.</p>\n\n<p>And because not everything is text you can also add images, videos and links.</p>\n\n<p>From grocery lists to complex projects brainstorm going through to-do lists CORTIZA is thought to be used by anyone, anywhere&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to bring this experience to every screen. Apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, RIM and browsers are already thought and collaboration between users will be added in beta.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/8761/108761v2-max-150x150.png"],[[106,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/8761/108761v2-max-250x250.png"],[[106,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/8761/108761v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"Sousa","permalink":"ricardo-sousa-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,144],"assets/images/resized/0015/9656/159656v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,240],"assets/images/resized/0015/9656/159656v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,432],"assets/images/resized/0015/9656/159656v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
