They have a deal with how-to hobbyistâ€™s site, Instructables, to make buying parts for your project a snap. Theyâ€™ve also got more parts suppliers calling to get their data up on the site.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/5778/15778v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/5778/15778v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[175,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/5778/15778v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"ThriftDB","permalink":"thriftdb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0013/6104/136104v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0013/6104/136104v1-max-250x250.png"],[[285,75],"assets/images/resized/0013/6104/136104v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Harish","last_name":"Agarwal","permalink":"harish-agarwal","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"Morey","permalink":"andres-morey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0014/6312/146312v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0014/6312/146312v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0014/6312/146312v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Wurzel","permalink":"samuel-wurzel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0014/6311/146311v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0014/6311/146311v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0014/6311/146311v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Bryan","last_name":"Newbold","permalink":"bryan-newbold","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$300k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":12,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Aydin","last_name":"Senkut","permalink":"aydin-senkut","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/9337/9337v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/9337/9337v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,375],"assets/images/resized/0000/9337/9337v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.felicis.com/team/aydin/\" title=\"Felicis Ventures\" rel=\"nofollow\">Felicis Ventures</a></p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Caufield","permalink":"frank-caufield-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Georges","last_name":"Harik","permalink":"georges-harik","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,123],"assets/images/resized/0002/4920/24920v1-max-150x150.png"],[[98,123],"assets/images/resized/0002/4920/24920v1-max-250x250.png"],[[98,123],"assets/images/resized/0002/4920/24920v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Graham","permalink":"paul-graham","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0001/6021/16021v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,228],"assets/images/resized/0001/6021/16021v4-max-250x250.png"],[[398,363],"assets/images/resized/0001/6021/16021v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Garry Tan / http://garry.posterous.com</p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Buchheit","permalink":"paul-buchheit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/5893/15893v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,133],"assets/images/resized/0001/5893/15893v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,133],"assets/images/resized/0001/5893/15893v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Trevor","last_name":"Blackwell","permalink":"trevor-blackwell","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/3376/23376v1-max-150x150.png"],[[165,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/3376/23376v1-max-250x250.png"],[[221,333],"assets/images/resized/0002/3376/23376v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"Garret","permalink":"ron-garret","image":null}},{"company":{"name":"XGYC","permalink":"xgyc","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"122 W 27th Street Floor 10","address2":"","zip_code":"10001","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.750608,"longitude":-122.423581}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0004/6330/46330v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,155],"assets/images/resized/0004/6330/46330v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,280],"assets/images/resized/0004/6330/46330v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
