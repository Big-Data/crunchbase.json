now can search among nearly three million for-sale listings on Zillow","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":22,"source_url":"http://zillow.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=159&item=63","source_text":"SEATTLE, July 22 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading real estate Web site Zillow.com today announced a broad expansion in the number of for-sale listings on the site, bringing the total number of live listings to nearly three million today. Consumers visiting Zillow have seen a sixfold increase in the number of listings since the start of this year, due to rapid growth in the Zillow Listings Feeds Program, whereby brokerages can market their listings on Zillow, for free, via a bulk feed. Since the launch of this program, Zillow has sent millions of visits from interested home buyers to the Web sites of partner brokerages.\r\n\r\n(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cg ... ILLOWLOGO)\r\n\r\nIn addition, buyers searching homes and neighborhoods on Zillow have more options in the types of homes for sale they can find. Buyers can now sort their searches by categories -- including homes with upcoming open houses, new construction, foreclosures, homes for sale by owner (FSBO) and Make Me Move homes. Buyers can also narrow their searches by type of listing, such as land for sale, single or multi-family homes, manufactured homes or condos and co-ops.\r\n\r\n\"We're incredibly pleased at the scope of new industry partners involved in our Listings Feeds program, and the resulting breadth of homes for sale and brokerages that buyers are able to find on our site today,\" said Jorrit Van der Meulen, vice president of partner relations at Zillow.\r\n\r\nPartners recently joining include major national brands such as Better Homes and GardensÂ® Real Estate, CENTURY 21Â®, Coldwell BankerÂ®, ERAÂ®, Sotheby's International RealtyÂ®, and Prudential. Additionally, the Zillow Listings Feeds program includes independent brokerages, such as RE/MAX Indiana, First Team Real Estate, Michael Saunders, and Intero Real Estate.\r\n\r\n\"As one of the earliest adopters to the Zillow Listings Feeds program, our brands, listings and Web sites have benefitted from an increase in exposure and traffic since we began syndicating to Zillow,\" said Craig Cuyar, SVP and CIO for the Realogy Franchise Group, and Zillow Advisory Board member.\r\n\r\nZillow is one of the most-visited online real estate sites with more than five million unique users every month, 90 percent of whom own a home and two-thirds who are buying or selling now, or in the next one to two years. Zillow's Listings Feeds program allows real estate brokerages to post for-sale listings directly to the site in an XML feed, giving the homes on Zillow a virtual for-sale sign at no cost. Listings Feeds partners also have the option to participate in the Virtual Sold Sign program, which provides permanent attribution and broker/agent contact information on the home's detail page, even long after the listing has sold. For enhanced exposure, individual agents can create a free profile page with photos, contact information and more details about the agent, linked directly from each listing. For more information on Zillow Listings Feeds, visit http://www.zillowfeeds.com/.\r\n\r\nAbout Zillow.com\r\n\r\nZillow.com is an online real estate community where homeowners, buyers, sellers, real estate agents and mortgage professionals find and share vital information about homes for free. Launched in early 2006 with ZestimateÂ® home values and data on millions of U.S. homes, Zillow has since opened the site to community input, data and dialogue. One of the most visited U.S. real estate Web sites, Zillow's goal is to help people become smarter about real estate in every stage of the home ownership process -- buying, selling, remodeling and financing. The company is headquartered in Seattle and has advertising sales offices in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.","source_description":"Buyers now can search among nearly three million
