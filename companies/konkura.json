Members can also use their knowledge, expertise and imagination to create new challenges for everyone to participate in.  </p>\n\n<p>Challenges can include any measurable activity and cover all aspects of sport and fitness: skill, cardio, strength, speed, power, endurance; any activity that can be measured can be turned into a challenge.  </p>\n\n<p>To take part in a challenge, members post their score, together with comments, photos and videos.  They can also exchange training tips and banter with other competitors about their performance.</p>\n\n<p>Konkura allows members to create all sorts of challenges:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Simple, single-event challenges covering any sport or fitness activity</li>\n<li>Advanced challenges featuring combinations of activities, for example turning an entire workout or weekly training programme into a challenge</li>\n<li>Sports clubs can create challenges based on their weekly training schedules, motivating team members and enabling coaches and captains to see whoâ€™s training hard (and whoâ€™s not!)</li>\n<li>Gyms and health clubs can create challenges for their members, based around particular fitness goals or exercise classes</li>\n<li>Personal trainers can create challenges for their clients, improving engagement and helping to recruit new clients</li>\n</ol>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Worthington","permalink":"ian-worthington","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Dr","last_name":"Phil Worthington","permalink":"dr-phil-worthington","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development Director","person":{"first_name":"Phil","last_name":"Tapsell","permalink":"phil-tapsell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Darren","last_name":"Pearce","permalink":"darren-pearce","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Bragster","permalink":"bragster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0001/2100/12100v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0001/2100/12100v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,370],"assets/images/resized/0001/2100/12100v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ibeatyou","permalink":"ibeatyou","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/6272/16272v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/6272/16272v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/6272/16272v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MapMyFitness","permalink":"mapmyfitness","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0009/4572/94572v2-max-150x150.png"],[[197,43],"assets/images/resized/0009/4572/94572v2-max-250x250.png"],[[197,43],"assets/images/resized/0009/4572/94572v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Endomondo","permalink":"endomondo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0006/5494/65494v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/5494/65494v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,148],"assets/images/resized/0006/5494/65494v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"walkrunjog","permalink":"walkrunjog","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£65k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":65000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Daresbury Innovation Centre","address2":"Keckwick Lane","zip_code":"WA4 4FS","city":"Daresbury","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0009/8696/98696v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,183],"assets/images/resized/0009/8696/98696v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,331],"assets/images/resized/0009/8696/98696v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,119],"assets/images/resized/0009/8697/98697v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,198],"assets/images/resized/0009/8697/98697v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,357],"assets/images/resized/0009/8697/98697v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
