Between my wife, my parents, and a trusted friend, my children have a small address book to memorize before I am sure they could reach one of us if they ever needed to. I created myaNUMBER to give young children one phone number to memorize and dial when they need to reach a trusted adult.</p>\n\n<p>myaNUMBER Product</p>\n\n<p>When a family signs up for a myaNUMBER they can choose between a local or toll free number that will ring up to 5 phones. The phones can ring all at once or consecutively in a predefined order. After a call is placed, an email and text message report is sent to each registered caretaker on the account. </p>\n\n<p>In partnership with AT&amp;T, myaNUMBER has been enhanced for AT&amp;T Subscribers allowing for real time geo location, messaging, sending &amp; receiving call from within the myaNUMBER Android app or in Browser experience. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0022/2371/222371v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0022/2371/222371v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0022/2371/222371v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Wantz","permalink":"john-wantz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0017/0479/170479v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,211],"assets/images/resized/0017/0479/170479v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,381],"assets/images/resized/0017/0479/170479v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Kyle","last_name":"Schei","permalink":"kyle-schei-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Network Partner","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"AT&T","permalink":"at-t","image":null}},{"title":"Platform Partner","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Tropo","permalink":"tropo","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0022/2368/222368v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,174],"assets/images/resized/0022/2368/222368v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,313],"assets/images/resized/0022/2368/222368v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0022/2369/222369v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,174],"assets/images/resized/0022/2369/222369v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,313],"assets/images/resized/0022/2369/222369v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0022/2370/222370v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,174],"assets/images/resized/0022/2370/222370v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,313],"assets/images/resized/0022/2370/222370v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://myanumber.com","title":".COM"}]}
