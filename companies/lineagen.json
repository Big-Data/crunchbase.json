Lineagen is committed to improving outcomes for those affected by autism and other complex diseases, for which effective early diagnosis and intervention can have a significant positive impact. The Companyâ€™s comprehensive genetic testing and support/counseling service are initially designed to enable early evaluation of children at risk for disorders of childhood development, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Founded in 2002, Lineagenâ€™s commercial strategy represents the culmination of significant proprietary research into genetic causes and diagnostic pathways of key complex diseases, including autism, MS and COPD. One of the companyâ€™s core research competitive advantages is its access through the University of Utah to the Utah Population Database, an unmatched biomarker discovery research platform that has been used to help the University identify more disease-related genes than any other institution in the world. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0009/9972/99972v1-max-150x150.png"],[[178,100],"assets/images/resized/0009/9972/99972v1-max-250x250.png"],[[178,100],"assets/images/resized/0009/9972/99972v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"S.
