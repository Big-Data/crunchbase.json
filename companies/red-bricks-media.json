The interactive agency was also selected for a Gold Communicator Award for its full-page magazine ad designed for client Balsam Hill, a premier online retailer of artificial Christmas trees.</p>\n\n<p>â€œWeâ€™re honored to win these three prestigious awards,â€ said Elliott Easterling, co-founder and CEO of Red Bricks Media. â€œThe fact that we are an interactive agency and are winning print awards reinforces our integrated, multi-channel capabilities. In this case, the two winning print ads successfully promoted awareness, traffic and conversions for our clientsâ€™ online presence.â€</p>\n\n<p>The Summit Creative Awards and the Communicator Awards are international competitions that receive thousands of entries from around the country. â€œWinning a Summit Creative Award is a significant accomplishment. The combination of our excellent judges and the tough judging criteria ensures that only deserving entries receive Summit recognition,â€ said Jocelyn Luciano, Executive Director for the Summit International Awards. Linda Day, the Director of the International Academy of the Visual Arts for the Communicator Awards, noted â€œThe quality, creativity and execution of this yearâ€™s work is a true testament to the talents and abilities of communications professionals from around the world. The entries received reflect an increasingly diversified industry and the work once again sets the bar extremely high.â€</p>\n\n<p>Both BusinessWeek and Balsam Hill approached Red Bricks Media to design full-page magazine ads. BusinessWeek wanted to promote its online news, information, and social sharing portal, BusinessExchange. One of the biggest advantages of BusinessExchange is that it allows users to create fully customized news feeds based on the userâ€™s interests. Red Bricks Mediaâ€™s innovative design resembled a news feed, featuring lines of grey text article headlines on a white background, with strategically highlighted words to convey the message â€œFind the news that matters to you.â€</p>\n\n<p>Red Bricks Mediaâ€™s other award-winning magazine print ad was designed for client Balsam Hill. Balsam Hill is a premier online retailer of luxury artificial Christmas trees, and the client called upon Red Bricks Media to design an elegant print ad that evoked a warm holiday spirit while capturing the selling points of the trees. The finalized print ad showcased an exquisite Christmas tree set against an inviting fireplace â€“ images of comfort and holiday cheer.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about Red Bricks Mediaâ€™s award-winning work, please contact sales [at] redbricksmedia.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0009/4639/94639v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0009/4639/94639v1-max-250x250.png"],[[279,32],"assets/images/resized/0009/4639/94639v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director, East","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Weiner","permalink":"dan-wiener","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Red Bricks San Francisco","address1":"1062 Folsom Street","address2":"Suite 300","zip_code":"94103","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Red Bricks New York","address1":"270 W. 39th St.","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"10018","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Red Bricks Hong Kong","address1":"8/F, Enterprise Square 3","address2":"39 Wang Chiu Road","zip_code":"","city":"Kowloon Bay","state_code":null,"country_code":"HKG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Red Bricks Becomes RBM, Tackles Dragons","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=135600","source_text":null,"source_description":"Red Bricks Becomes RBM, Tackles Dragons - Media Post","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Red Bricks Media","permalink":"red-bricks-media"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0009/4640/94640v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,203],"assets/images/resized/0009/4640/94640v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,366],"assets/images/resized/0009/4640/94640v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
