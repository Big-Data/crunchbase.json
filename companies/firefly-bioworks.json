(Cambridge, MA) is introducing an open platform allowing industrial, academic and clinical scientists to develop and use multiplexed biological assays on standard laboratory instrumentation. The company&#8217;s core technology, Optical Liquid Stamping, was developed in the Chemical Engineering Department at MIT (News - Alert) by Firefly co-founders. The method allows rapid and scalable synthesis of encoded, multi-functional particles for the quantification of biological function. The company&#8217;s long-term vision is to provide research and clinical scientists with reliable and affordable solutions for the comprehensive monitoring of biological systems.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0019/1514/191514v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0019/1514/191514v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[414,99],"assets/images/resized/0019/1514/191514v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Davide","last_name":"M.
