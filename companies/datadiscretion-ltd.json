Our innovative encryption technology keeps your data safe whilst still using an elegantly simple user interface.</p>\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s networked world, users have no influence over who has access to the data, where the data will be copied to or how old equipment will be disposed of. DataDiscretion&#8217;s technology allows users to protect their data; now and in future when computers will be far more powerful.</p>\n\n<p>New security standards are continuously developed and declared unbreakable but technology advances at such a rate that they are soon breached. &#8220;One-time-pad&#8221; is the only technique that can withstand any future attack. The DiscreetKey provides this one-time-pad capability, previously dismissed as impractical, in a convenient, simple to use device.</p>\n\n<p>DataDiscretion uses the metaphor of a â€˜keyâ€™ understandable to anyone. This &#8220;key&#8221; enables the user to encrypt documents quickly, simply and reliably. Should a key be lost the customer can make a replacement using their KeyMaker.</p>\n\n<p>The DiscreetKey allows you to encrypt documents on your computer using ultra-secure &#8220;one-time-pad&#8221; technology. The simple user interface eliminates possible errors such as forgetting to re-encrypt a document after accessing it.</p>\n\n<p>DataDiscretionâ€™s products require no installation and no passwords. All products provide maximum security, work on any file type and documents can be saved on PC, web, shared networks, etc. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0009/6857/96857v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0009/6857/96857v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0009/6857/96857v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Birmingham Science Park","address1":"Faraday Wharf","address2":"Holt Street","zip_code":"B7 4BB","city":"Birmingham","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
