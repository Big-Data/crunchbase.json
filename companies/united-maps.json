navigation market leaders like Navteq, Tele Atlas or AND â€“ and algorithmically match them with value-added cartographic data and relevant information layers thereby conflated into new data products.</p>\n\n<p>United Maps generates content-rich, white-labeled, highly detailed and fully routable vector maps for mobile and pedestrian usecases. </p>\n\n<p>Proprietary conflation algorithms automatically match vectorized basemaps with a high degree of precision. </p>\n\n<p>Relevant content layers are added for mobile usecases \nand seamless multimodal navigation: </p>\n\n<p>Â» public transport (subway, tram, railnetworks) </p>\n\n<p>Â» pathes, walkways and trails for hiking and outdoor </p>\n\n<p>Â» precise house footprints, addresses </p>\n\n<p>The hyperlocal mapping products enable location-based applications, media and services for connected mobile devices, BPO, LBS and multi-modal navigation on a mobile, human scale.</p>\n\n<p>United Maps operates in B2B and professional services, offering white-labeled and on-demand services. </p>\n\n<p>Germany is scheduled for Q1/09, followed by Austria, Switzerland and a rollout of 200 larger European cities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/8463/28463v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/8463/28463v2-max-250x250.png"],[[258,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/8463/28463v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"UM-GER","permalink":"um-ger","image":null},{"name":"UM-AT","permalink":"um-at","image":null},{"name":"UM-CH","permalink":"um-ch","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Wiedmann","permalink":"andreas-wiedmann","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CIO","person":{"first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"Knecht","permalink":"stefan-knecht","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/8461/28461v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/8461/28461v2-max-250x250.png"],[[258,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/8461/28461v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>United
