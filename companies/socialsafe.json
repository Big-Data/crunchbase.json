This includes photos, tagged photos, profile information, contact details, with additional data being included in future upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>SocialSafe offers a simple, fun and effective solution for Facebook users. It allows them to download their photos, including any that they have been tagged in, see snapshots of friends found &amp; lost over time and safeguard all these important things by backing them up to their own computer.</p>\n\n<p>If a Facebook account is lost, hacked or deactivated, using SocialSafe the user can rebuild their stored data to a new Facebook account. This also applies to their friendsâ€™ data that was linked to the original profile. This is particularly helpful as, due to the sheer amount of information (photos, contact details, etc.), few people would be able to remember all their friendsâ€™ contact details should they lose access to their Facebook account without warning. </p>\n\n<p>SocialSafe is a joint venture between iBundle (innovation hub for software and web companies providing innovative new tools and services for their target markets) and 1minus1 (creative web design &amp; development agency).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/7753/57753v7-max-150x150.png"],[[228,55],"assets/images/resized/0005/7753/57753v7-max-250x250.png"],[[228,55],"assets/images/resized/0005/7753/57753v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Ranger","permalink":"julian-ranger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JulianRanger</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Pascal","last_name":"Wheeler","permalink":"pascal-wheeler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Social Media & Marketing Assistant","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Robertson","permalink":"andy-robertson-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"The BlueDoor","permalink":"the-bluedoor","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main office","address1":"Unit 2a, The Reeds Business Centre","address2":"Reeds Road","zip_code":"GU10 3BP","city":"Frensham, Nr Farnham","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.179195,"longitude":-0.8212037}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2009/08/03/socialsafe/","title":"SocialSafe: Get Your Facebook Data Out of Facebook"}]}
