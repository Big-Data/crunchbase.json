In return, borrowers &amp; their agents receive custom quotes &amp; solutions from active and interested lenders.</p>\n\n<p>By eliminating lead generation and commission arrangements to client development AND introducing more clarity, choice and control for all parties, the experience improves for borrowers, brokers &amp; lenders. Borrowing may never be fun but finding out your options quickly and conveniently is a good start. </p>\n\n<p>Our community research also indicated a high level of frustration when trying to access the secondary market for whole loans or notes, especially at the local level. </p>\n\n<p>The local expert is often the best suited to clear troubled properties and loan assets in their own community. As a result, the note exchange features the same principles of clarity, choice &amp; control for all parties when buying and selling real estate notes.</p>","image":null,"products":[{"name":"Commercial & Residential Real Estate  Loans - Conventional & Unconventional","permalink":"commercial-residential-real-estate-loans-conventional-unconventional","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Trudy M.","last_name":"Smit, CFA","permalink":"trudy-smit","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"2121 Avenue of the Stars","address2":"","zip_code":"90067","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"HQ","address1":"2121 Avenue of the Stars","address2":"","zip_code":"90067","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Beta Launch ","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Loan Interchange","permalink":"loan-interchange"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/9960/159960v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0015/9960/159960v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0015/9960/159960v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.loaninterchange.com/LoanLight/","title":"Company Blog"}]}
