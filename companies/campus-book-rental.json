The company was one of the first to offer &#8220;textbook rentals&#8221;, and began renting textbooks from Alan Martin&#8217;s garage in August 2007. Since then, CampusBookRentals has rented over one million textbooks to students on nearly every college campus in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Textbook rentals&#8221; have been disruptive to the traditional new and used textbook markets, sometimes offering students savings of up to 90%, and removing the sell-back risk students face at the end of each semester. The service includes free shipping both ways and allows students to specify their own rental period.  The company also awards scholarships, and is actively philanthropic, currently contributing a portion of rental proceeds to Operation Smile. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/9989/109989v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0010/9989/109989v4-max-250x250.png"],[[400,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/9989/109989v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Martin","permalink":"alan-martin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Jamie","last_name":"Harper","permalink":"jamie-harper-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Business Development Officer ","person":{"first_name":"Shane","last_name":"Willard","permalink":"shane-willard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Martin","permalink":"ken-martin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"McCormick","permalink":"todd-mccormick","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager","person":{"first_name":"Jase","last_name":"McCormick","permalink":"jase-mccormick","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Brennon","last_name":"Garrett","permalink":"brennon-garrett","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Call Center Manager","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Willoughby","permalink":"dave-willoughby","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Call Center Manager","person":{"first_name":"Nate","last_name":"Hibbert","permalink":"nate-hibbert","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"HR Manager","person":{"first_name":"Saralyn","last_name":"Barnes","permalink":"saralyn-barnes","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Call Center Manager","person":{"first_name":"Malia","last_name":"Bond","permalink":"malia-bond","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Chegg","permalink":"chegg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"BookRenter.com","permalink":"bookrenter-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0003/2052/32052v3-max-150x150.png"],[[242,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/2052/32052v3-max-250x250.png"],[[242,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/2052/32052v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$20M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/02/chegg-rival-campusbookrentals-com-closes-20-million-financing-round/","source_description":"Chegg Rival CampusBookRentals.com Closes $20 Million Financing Round","raised_amount":20000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Level Equity","permalink":"level-equity","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Five Elms Capital","permalink":"five-elms-capital","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Cherokee & Walker","permalink":"cherokee-walker","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Physical Address","address1":"2805 S. 2025 W.","address2":"","zip_code":"84401","city":"West Haven","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0010/9990/109990v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,158],"assets/images/resized/0010/9990/109990v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,284],"assets/images/resized/0010/9990/109990v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
