Translational Software addresses the logistics of providing tests and transforms test results into actionable knowledge for the doctor.</p>\n\n<p>The first product from the company is the PgxPortal which is focused on enabling doctors to make prescribing decisions that are informed by their patients’ genetic makeup. The platform enables clinicians to understand when genetic tests are appropriate and then to order and interpret them within their existing workflow. </p>\n\n<p>Primary features of the portal are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simplified test ordering through the clinician’s medical records system, a web portal, or tablet based application</li>\n<li>Integration with laboratory systems that enables structured reporting of genetic traits</li>\n<li>An “App Store” for clinical genomics that provides a knowledgebase and pluggable algorithms for guiding prescribing decisions</li>\n<li>A report writer that formats output in accordance with the recipient’s wishes</li>\n<li>A distribution engine that can place test results within medical records or contact recipients through email, text, or fax to make their reports available</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Translational Software is an early stage company that is establishing partnerships to deliver advanced diagnostics into a variety of clinical settings.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0019/4942/194942v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0019/4942/194942v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0019/4942/194942v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
