The mobile Internet is a new consumer utility alongside water and electricity – and it is more available than either.  Hundreds of millions accessing this new utility are patients and families taking care of themselves or loved ones.  They have no tools, no rewards and no recognition – and yet they are the largest and most important group of healthcare workers in the world.  There are at least 50 million such family caregivers in the United States alone.</p>\n\n<p>The opportunity for Proteus is to enable pharmaceutical companies and health care providers to plug into this existing network and help families do their caregiving job more effectively.</p>\n\n<p>At Proteus we believe that the drug is the plug.  Proteus makes a computer chip made from food ingredients specifically designed to be co-manufactured with drugs at ultra-low cost.  Proteus-enabled products deliver medicine combined with information, education and motivation at prices that are highly affordable for health systems and consumers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/1757/71757v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[183,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/1757/71757v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[183,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/1757/71757v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technical Officer & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Zdeblick, Ph.D.","permalink":"mark-zdeblick-ph-d","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Thompson","permalink":"andrew-thompson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Medical Officer & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Savage, M.D.","permalink":"george-savage-m-d","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Vice President, Operations","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Costello, Ph.D.","permalink":"ben-costello-ph-d","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Product Officer","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"O'Reilly","permalink":"david-oreilly","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$25.4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1228295/000122829509000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D","raised_amount":25449979,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":31,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2600 Bridge Parkway","address2":"Suite 101","zip_code":"94065","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0008/2152/82152v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,201],"assets/images/resized/0008/2152/82152v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,363],"assets/images/resized/0008/2152/82152v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Proteus-Biomedical/137527819596333?sk=wall","title":"Facebook"}]}
