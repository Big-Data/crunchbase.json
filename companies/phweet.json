You then plug in the Twitter username of the person you want to call. The system generates a â€œPhweetâ€ which is a unique shortURL. The â€œPhweetUrlâ€ calls you and you can share who you are talking to without having to reveal or exchange phone numbers or other identities. Once the conversation ends, the unique URL expires and the session message board disappears.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/3072/23072v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0002/3072/23072v1-max-250x250.png"],[[252,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3072/23072v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
