For many small business owners, finding the right designer can be a tedious process. Whether youâ€™re looking for someone to complete a one-time project or to design on an ongoing basis, your designer should understand your business, match your design style and aesthetic, and be able to work within your budget and time constraints. How do you find the right designer? Try crowdsourcing. </p>\n\n<p>So, what is crowdsourcing?\nIn a nutshell, itâ€™s asking many people to do a single job and picking the one you like best. It is tapping into the creative potential of thousands, sparking a healthy competition that demands greater performance from each participant, with the result being the best possible choice from hundreds. Crowdsourcing has become wildly successful in the design industry as the world becomes more and more connected and the need for good design becomes more and more relevant. </p>\n\n<p>Crowdsourcing for graphic design has achieved explosive growth due, in large part, to small and growing businesses and their need for high quality, custom design on a budget. It can be a difficult, lengthy, and expensive process for small businesses to find a graphic design source they are happy with. Clients may scroll through many portfolios, browse websites, or even pick a name from the phone book and hire a single designer for their project â€“ but what happens when they arenâ€™t satisfied with the designer they choose? With a single designer or even a design firm, a client is typically presented with a few design options based on their wants and needs, they may be allowed a few rounds of revisions to the concepts presented, but ultimately are stuck with whatever design is created for them. </p>\n\n<p>Are there different types of crowdsourcing?\nThere are several crowdsourcing resources available to small businesses looking for a freelance designer, wherein the client posts their project needs and designers bid on the project. However, again, youâ€™re choosing a designer first and hoping for the right design in the end. With spec design crowdsourcing, you choose the perfect design first, and only hire the designer that works for you.</p>\n\n<p>With spec crowdsourcing, qualified designers have the opportunity to present their design concepts to a client based on the clientâ€™s design brief. A logo contest, for example, may receive upwards of three to four hundred entries. Instead of a single designer or design firm submitting only a few design concepts, or a client picking a single designer based only on their bid,  creatives from around the world present him with hundreds of options, each custom created, in hopes of winning the design contest. The client chooses the design he likes best and pays only for that one. And, the entire process is handled over the web, in your time frame and on your budget.</p>\n\n<p>How do I find the right crowdsourcing website?\nWhile there are dozens of design crowdsourcing sites available, itâ€™s important to find the right one. Look for a site that has been accredited by the Better Business Bureau, offers a risk-free, money back satisfaction guarantee, has a support staff on hand to answer any questions you may have, pre-qualifies all of their designers, and has a team of moderators reviewing contest entries for originality, creativity and skill to assure that you only end up with an original, custom created graphic design. One site that meets all of these important qualities is DesignContest.com.  </p>\n\n<p>But, unlike other crowdsourcing sites, DesignContest.com takes the concept a step further. Once a client has found the design they like, they now have the opportunity to continue working with the designer for ongoing One-on-One Projects. DesignContestâ€™s goal is first, to connect clients with the right designer for them and second, to provide the platform for them to continue working together for ongoing projects.</p>\n\n<p>So, whether youâ€™re in need of a logo for your new business, a website that perfectly captures your brandâ€™s message, or a new letterhead design, save your valuable time and money and find the right graphic designer for your small business - through crowdsourcing!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0014/8802/148802v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0014/8802/148802v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,82],"assets/images/resized/0014/8802/148802v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"99designs","permalink":"99designs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/4438/14438v11-max-150x150.png"],[[193,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/4438/14438v11-max-250x250.png"],[[193,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/4438/14438v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"crowdSPRING","permalink":"crowdspring","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/4431/14431v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/4431/14431v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,117],"assets/images/resized/0001/4431/14431v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Logomyway","permalink":"logomyway","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/6749/46749v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/6749/46749v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,89],"assets/images/resized/0004/6749/46749v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"DesignBay","permalink":"designbay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/2164/22164v1-max-150x150.png"],[[193,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/2164/22164v1-max-250x250.png"],[[193,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/2164/22164v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"DesignContest","address1":"578 Washington Blvd","address2":"Suite 515","zip_code":"90292","city":"Marina del Rey","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://inspirationfeed.com/articles/review-designcontest-com-not-your-typical-crowdsourcing-site/","title":"DesignContest.com - Not Your Typical Crowdsourcing Site"}]}
