The company is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>In emerging countries and other countries, many titles never get chances to be distributed or no longer distributed through conventional printed ecosystem.

They also need all publishers; from small to major publisher, from academic to general reference publisher even corporate publisher have a chance to have digital bookstore with affordable cost &amp; easiness to adopt.</p>\n\n<p>Buqu Platform format is secure with encryption process, light-weight in size and possible to resume the download process.
