With JRapid, Java\ndevelopers can create cloud-ready, enterprise applications up to 5 times faster than on conventional platforms. JRapid is targeting Java developers  and aims to be the de-facto solution for &#8220;Java on the cloud&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>JRapid can be used either online through its web-based designer or through Eclipse using the JRapid plug-in for Eclipse, enabling developers to keep their desktop synchronized with the cloud. The magic behind JRapid is its code generator which automatically generates all the layers of the application.</p>\n\n<p>JRapid allows Java developers to build enterprise applications with forms, listings, reports, and charts. What makes JRapid different from other products is that it lets developers create powerful applications&#8211;not just the usual CRUDs&#8211;with an impressive user interface, lots of add-ons, automatically generated business intelligence functionality, and everything necessary to run in \nthe cloud with just one click.</p>\n\n<p>Applications built with JRapid use the traditional Java web stack&#8211;HTML, Ajax, RESTful Web Services, POJOs, Hibernate, MySQL/Oracle/PostgreSQL/etc&#8211;and run on any standard Java application server. Developers can deploy applications built with JRapid on their own servers or use JRapid cloud servers running on Amazon Web Services.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,70],"assets/images/resized/0006/3223/63223v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,70],"assets/images/resized/0006/3223/63223v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[134,70],"assets/images/resized/0006/3223/63223v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$420k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.canal-ar.com.ar/Noticias/NoticiaMuestra.asp?Id=5134","source_description":"InterSoft invirtiÃ³ USD 100.000 en PRODA Software","raised_amount":120000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.ebizlatam.com/news/129/ARTICLE/11895/2010-07-14.html","source_description":"JRapid recibe una inversiÃ³n para el desarrollo de cloud computing","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Development","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Buenos Aires","state_code":null,"country_code":"ARG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
