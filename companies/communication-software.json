(CSI) provides innovative technology solutions for market research, communication services and clean energy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CSI</strong> was founded by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/Ashoke-Bose\" title=\"Ashoke Bose\">Ashoke Bose</a> in 1991. The purpose of creating CSI was to market an innovative product <strong>Strategic Network System</strong> which is capable of simulating flow of information in a group of persons.  This product was tested by a Wall street brokerage firm to evaluate the value of &#8220;Word of Mouth&#8221; marketing strategy. This was much before the days of myspace or facebook. The result was interesting and was presented at the SUGI 18 (SAS User Group International) conference in New York in 1993. The market was not ready for such technology at that time.</p>\n\n<p>In 1992, <em>CSI</em> conducted Fair Market Rent (FMR) studies for the City of Tucson Housing Authority. The officials of Tucson did not accept the Tucson FMR data provided by Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which was responsible for administering Section-8 Housing Assistance program in USA. City of Tucson contracted with CSI Consulting service to collect renters data in accordance with the HUD FMR Guidelines for List Assisted Random Digit Dialing (RDD) methodology. CSI&#8217;s report proved that HUD&#8217;s FMR was inaccurate for Tucson MSA. Therefore, City was given additional funding to meet the rental needs. By end of 1994, CSI became the market leader in providing FMR studies in USA. CSI conducted 10,000+ calls for each project by utilizing Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to FMR projects, CSI conducted Seat Belt Use studies for Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota and Maine.</p>\n\n<p>In 1995, CSI initiated OpinionUSA.com project for online data collection via internet.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,58],"assets/images/resized/0016/0853/160853v2-max-150x150.png"],[[80,58],"assets/images/resized/0016/0853/160853v2-max-250x250.png"],[[80,58],"assets/images/resized/0016/0853/160853v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sascommunity.org/sugi/SUGI93/Sugi-93-99%20Bose.pdf","title":"Paper on Strategic Network System at SUGI 18 in 1993"}]}
