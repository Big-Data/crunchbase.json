The solution allows product authentication through the use of standard mobile phones. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, consumers of medications and branded consumer items have no way to check the product authenticity of the item they wish to purchase. Authix solution will provide consumers with a reliable and easy-to-use method of checking that the product they are about to purchase is original and genuine or to discover a fake. </p>\n\n<p>Authix is designing a small unique tag that will be inserted in each package or within the item to be purchased. At time of purchase, the consumer communicates through the cell phone with that tag, and receives a message on the phone display indicating whether the product is genuine or counterfeit. </p>\n\n<p>Brand manufacturers are expected to the tags and the authentication services as follows: (i) manufacturers buy the brand tags from Authix, (ii) Authix maintain an authentication server which is accessed 24/7 by Internet, SMS or Instant Messaging, (iii) the manufacturers pay Authix for the Service.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0007/3260/73260v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/3260/73260v2-max-250x250.png"],[[294,98],"assets/images/resized/0007/3260/73260v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬1.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":400000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Innogest","permalink":"innogest-sgr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/1675/61675v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[135,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/1675/61675v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[135,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/1675/61675v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":700000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Innogest","permalink":"innogest-sgr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/1675/61675v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[135,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/1675/61675v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[135,131],"assets/images/resized/0006/1675/61675v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Corso Castelfidardo 30/A","address2":"","zip_code":"10129","city":"Torino","state_code":null,"country_code":"GRC","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.e-periscope.eu/Page/t02/view_html?idp=255","title":"Interview with Meir Zucker, business founder, Authix Technologies"}]}
