We define interactions based on user generated content and user interactions on our platform. The DormDuels platform is based on contests that mimic typical college life and persona&#8217;s. </p>\n\n<p>Here at DormDuels our motto is &#8220;Get in &amp; Win&#8221; and by that we mean that we want every user that comes across our site to &#8220;Win&#8221; somehow. This could be something as big as winning a national contest, a local college contest or just getting a great deal on a product.</p>\n\n<p>Contests are determined by votes, which right now is in the form of facebook &#8220;Likes&#8221; with Like buttons. </p>\n\n<p>In the future we will have a much more dynamic website that connects the users to every action they or their friends are doing on DormDuels. College students work hard, and they deserve rewards for it!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/8920/158920v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,135],"assets/images/resized/0015/8920/158920v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,135],"assets/images/resized/0015/8920/158920v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
