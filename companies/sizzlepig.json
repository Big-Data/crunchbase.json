However, digital image processing still takes the labor-intensive work it did in the 90’s.</p>\n\n<p>Much like manufacturing, a batch of material goes in and product comes out. The defects are hand-picked from the pile and redone manually. It is an ineffective and costly form of mass production.   </p>\n\n<p>This is why we developed sizzlepig™ — a software as a service (SaaS) tool integrating directly with Dropbox.   sizzlepig resizes large numbers of images/pictures with precision.  It eliminates defects, and creates craftsmanship quality pieces — all controlled visually.  It also solves another common challenge: How to satisfy customer needs and increasing technology demands by producing high-quality images without increasing production costs. </p>\n\n<p>This is a Global challenge and one that commonly bothered us at Grit Design, Inc. We knew we were wasting time in our own develoment efforts. That’s why we created sizzlepig.</p>\n\n<p>Cost, time, quality, control, sizing and access (integrated directly with Dropbox) are welcomed results by anyone who has to create and produce images. Made for anyone working with images, such as Ad Agencies, businesses, freelancers, photographers, architects and more. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0021/3851/213851v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0021/3851/213851v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,138],"assets/images/resized/0021/3851/213851v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1938 Franklin Street","address2":"Suite, 103","zip_code":"48207","city":"detroit","state_code":"MI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/D0NNUsf20eU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Tutorial by User Jack Bremer</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ddbWvPFkAZU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>sizzlepig cloud batch image resizing</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[29,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/9519/219519v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[48,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/9519/219519v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[87,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/9519/219519v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/RQNrBx","title":"User Review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/Q4K1im","title":"MakeUseOf Review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/PFpAIL","title":"Resize Multiple Images Without any Software by Labnol.org"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/RnSWWZ","title":"Intuitive Cloud Concept : by MediaCrayon"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/WYLkBo","title":"Geekissimo Review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/RuhKie","title":"What's Mac review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/Q4KHEe","title":"t3n Review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/UexIfc","title":"maestroalberto.it Review"},{"external_url":"http://sizzlepig.pressdoc.com/34087-sizzlepig-beta-now-open","title":"Press Release Nov 1, 2012"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/RuD5cW","title":"isopixel.net Review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/SPWAww","title":"CreativeBloq Review"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/SUlhst","title":"MOMB"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/TydTk2","title":"caracasdesign"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/VWfMah","title":"enlazandoweb"},{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/Ry0loV","title":"KillerStartup Review"}]}
