Buying from them has traditionally been the domain of large companies with large buying power, giving them sole access to products at their actual production prices.</p>\n\n<p>FillTheContainer.com levels the playing field, enabling anyone to buy from the same factories as the big guys. That means anyone can buy at actual production prices, up to 80% lower than retail.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Aamir","last_name":"Baig","permalink":"aamir-baig-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Costco","permalink":"costco","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sam's club","permalink":"sams-club","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wayfair","permalink":"wayfair-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0015/6753/156753v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0015/6753/156753v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6753/156753v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Amazon","permalink":"amazon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,89],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,89],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"6820 188th St","address2":"#22","zip_code":"V4N 3G6","city":"Surrey","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/42365443\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n","description":"<p>Get huge savings by buying collectively from the actual factory.
