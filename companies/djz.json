It was a religious experience. Three years later, driving home, listening to the radio, Bassnectar’s remix of Ellie Goulding’s “Lights” came on the “top hits” channel. Seth realized that this crazy, electronic sound that he had experienced years ago was moving from the fringe to the center of our music culture. After Googling and scouring the Web, he found there wasn’t an easy place to get totally immersed in the DJ culture and there were a zillion Generation Z fans, folks who grew up in the internet era, who were looking for that very thing. All electronic. All DJs. All in one place.</p>\n\n<p>DJs ARE the new rockstars, so we are stoked to bring you a site dedicated to their world and everything that is electronic dance music. From new releases, shows, festivals, top news, apps and more, DJZ is giving you the all-access pass. Tour through the everyday life of your favorite DJ or learn about new artists! Instead of searching all over the web for all of the latest news, here’s your one place to find it all. Put on your headphones, grab your glow sticks, and get ready for the best show of your life.

DJZ.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0021/8179/218179v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0021/8179/218179v1-max-250x250.png"],[[277,163],"assets/images/resized/0021/8179/218179v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"DJZ
