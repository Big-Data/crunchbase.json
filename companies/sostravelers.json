The traveler can easily submit a request that is transmitted to an experienced official travel agent, available 24x7. The travel agent will call or email the traveler with an answer or an update concerning the solution to the traveler&#8217;s request.</p>\n\n<p>SOSTravelers uses the real-time Internet (Twitter, Facebook, and other information systems) to recognize when and in which places there are delays and to communicate with â€œstuckâ€ people. When a â€œstuckâ€ person tweets, @SOSTravelers &#8216;listens&#8217; to the various tweets and start communicating with the traveler. The dialogue starts and the service matches his or her needs with local solutions for travel, food and lodging. Individual tweets often represent a group for which SOSTravelers can arrange a taxi â€“ or a coach â€“ and in some cases even get group discounts on nearby hotels or restaurant deliveries. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Philippe","last_name":"Scheimann","permalink":"philippe-scheimann","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.israel21c.org/201106169133/tourism/stuck-in-transit-sostravelers-to-the-rescue","title":""}]}
