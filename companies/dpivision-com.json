Under Wladimir&#8217;s leadership, it quickly grew into a successful business and during the course of the next 8 years, developed award-winning software to enable companies to perform more efficiently online. </p>\n\n<p>Dpivision secured a plethora of international clients, including office giant Regus, the European airline Flybe.com, a selection of Universities and many public sector organisations. Two strong products were developed under the Dpivision umbrella: Tradingeye, an accessible e-commerce shopping cart, and CannyBill, an invoicing and billing solution for hosting companies, which went on to secure a clutch of awards.</p>\n\n<p>Tradingeye was the first shopping cart to be built using pure XHTML/CSS and comply with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and Section 508. It went on to power thousands of online stores around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>CannyBill was one of the first SaaS applications for web hosting companies with customers and partners, including UK2.net (one of the worldâ€™s largest hosting providers), VPS.net and SingleHop an Inc. 500 company.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, Wladimir sold Dpivision to launch his latest venture.</p>\n\n<p>Dpivision was then aquired again in 2012 before being spun out under a dedicated Tradingeye brand which is still live today.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0003/5884/35884v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0003/5884/35884v4-max-250x250.png"],[[254,189],"assets/images/resized/0003/5884/35884v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"CannyBill ","permalink":"cannybill","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0003/5958/35958v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0003/5958/35958v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0003/5958/35958v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"Tradingeye","permalink":"tradingeye-xhtml-css-shopping-cart-cms","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0006/6150/66150v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0006/6150/66150v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[258,51],"assets/images/resized/0006/6150/66150v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Mills","permalink":"james-mills","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Wladimir","last_name":"Baranoff-Rossine","permalink":"wladimir-baranoff-rossine-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0020/9429/209429v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,244],"assets/images/resized/0020/9429/209429v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,439],"assets/images/resized/0020/9429/209429v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$150k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"","source_description":"The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG)","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"stock","source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":3,"acquired_day":27,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Electronic and Mobile Commerce Software Ltd","permalink":"electronic-and-mobile-commerce-software-ltd","image":null}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"The Attic","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2009/06/dpivision-head-to-capital/","title":"Dpivision.com heads to the capital for another exclusive event"},{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2009/03/our-creativity-is-spotted-by-the-crossover-4ip-labs/","title":"Our creativity is spotted by the Crossover 4IP Labs"},{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2009/01/dpivisioncom-inspiring-design/","title":"Dpivision.com: Inspiring Design"},{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2009/01/dpivisioncom-ltd-features-in-top-design-guide/","title":"Dpivision.com features in top design guide"},{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2008/10/dpivision-sexy-innovative-and-fresh/","title":"Dpivision.com: sexy, innovative and fresh"},{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2008/03/dpivision-sets-the-standard-for-equality/","title":"Dpivision Sets the Standard for Equality"},{"external_url":"http://blog.dpivision.com/2010/05/bthere-inflight-magazine-brussels-airlines/","title":"bthere: Inflight Magazine Brussels Airlines"}]}
