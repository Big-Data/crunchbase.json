There are now three divisions that make up Slalom, LLC: Slalom Consulting, 2Degrees and SuperConnect. Capitalizing on its local consultant model, which minimizes travel overhead for clients, Slalom has grown to more than 1,800 consultants who cover a wide range of business and technology services.\nIn recent years, Slalom Consulting has excelled in bringing innovation to its clients with a myriad of applications and projects such as a mobile employee directory for the Slalom consultants spread out across the country to put faces with names and find internal experts, targeted 90-second games to promote learning and team collaboration, and other tools that saw enormous demand from customers. We watched and learned how these early tools succeeded and identified areas for improvement. The Slalom teams saw a need to address trending business problems that many organizations face by offering standardized products. Slalom identified key leaders in the technology and mobile spaces from within Slalom Consulting to explore the possibility of a product division, and SuperConnect was born.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0021/4477/214477v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0021/4477/214477v2-max-250x250.png"],[[311,88],"assets/images/resized/0021/4477/214477v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.superconnect.com/","title":"Mobile gaming platform"}]}
