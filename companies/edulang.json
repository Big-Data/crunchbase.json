Their three current flagship products are English Addicts, Test Simulator and SnaPanda.</p>\n\n<p>English Addicts is a daily English Lesson based on authentic news stories from Voice of America. With over 1500 lessons online and five new lessons a week, the prime objective is to encourage learners to become active while listening, improving their vocabulary and comprehension. </p>\n\n<p>Test Simulator is an elearning application launched in 2009 to imitate real-life test-taking conditions of the TOEIC® and TOEFL® tests. Five tests can be taken in practice or test mode, accompanied by a tracking or progress view for both teachers and students. It aims at preparing students for typical content, time management, and test structure.\nIn 2009, ETS Global chose Test Simulator TOEIC® to be the only online test preparation it commercializes in Europe. </p>\n\n<p>Released on the Android Market on December 9, 2010, SnaPanda is an Augmented reality English dictionary. Using a smartphone camera view, a user can touch a word they see in a book or magazine on their screen, and then obtain the word&#8217;s definition. It has received positive press by Gizmodo, TechCrunch, Android Central, and Android Guys among others.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, unique in the publishing industry, Edulang changed its business model on December 1st, 2011 towards a Pay what you want approach. Fifty percent of the contributions from new clients are donated to Room to Read and the other half covers internal costs and business development.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0017/0020/170020v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0017/0020/170020v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,118],"assets/images/resized/0017/0020/170020v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Edulang","address1":"ZA de la Boissière","address2":"","zip_code":"29600","city":"Morlaix","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://pwyw.edulang.com/","title":"Pay What You Want"},{"external_url":"http://www.testsimulator.com/","title":"Test Simulator"},{"external_url":"http://www.englishaddicts.com/","title":"English Addicts"},{"external_url":"http://www.snapanda.com","title":"SnaPanda"}]}
