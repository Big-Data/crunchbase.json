The commercialization triangle that NetVentures services includes: Audience, publishers, and content right holders.</p>\n\n<p>As the line between broadcast TV, film and online media continues to be blurred, creating a social and audience-focused transmedia platform has become more essential. The one-to-many relationship and lack of feedback channel that traditional media are founded on no longer exists as a new foundation has been laid, allowing for both a two-way communication channel between media publisher and each individual user. The top down approach used in the &#8216;broadcast&#8217; paradigm has been changed to a bottom up, with the audience at the top of the pyramid.  </p>\n\n<p>With innovations in commercialization, Netventures decade-long online video focus has included creating new and sustainable revenue streams for all online media. The custom developed ad platform used to fuel these monetization strategies has been built specifically on the paradigm of time-based media, allowing for unique opportunities to create value for content owners and publishers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,148],"assets/images/resized/0012/0402/120402v2-max-150x150.png"],[[148,148],"assets/images/resized/0012/0402/120402v2-max-250x250.png"],[[148,148],"assets/images/resized/0012/0402/120402v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Page","permalink":"michael-page","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"Kaplan","permalink":"antonio-kaplan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0022/2077/222077v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0022/2077/222077v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0022/2077/222077v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Antonio Kaplan / <a href=\"http://innovent.tv\" title=\"Innovent LLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Innovent LLC</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"287 Elizabeth Street","address2":"Level 8","zip_code":"2000","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
