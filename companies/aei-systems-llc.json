Since 2002, AEi Systems has continued its growth in Worst Case Circuit Analysis and failure and reliability analysis for space-bound DC-DC converters. In addition, the company has more recently become known as a designer and supplier of highly specialized radiation-hardened power supplies and related power system circuitry.</p>\n\n<p>The company has four, inter-related business lines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis: Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analyses.</li>\n<li>Design: Design and licensing or sale of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and related power system circuitry.</li>\n<li>SPICE Modeling: Modeling of complex ICs for major manufacturers and to support AEi Systems analysis and design work.</li>\n<li>Software: Sale of licensed copies of (i) the company&#8217;s Power IC Model Library for PSpice, and (ii) certain WCCA templates and tables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Noteworthy achievements and facts</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Motorola University&#8217;s &#8220;six sigma class&#8221; on worst case analysis was created by AEi Systems</li>\n<li>The failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world&#8217;s largest and most powerful particle accelerator) was revised and upgraded by AEi Systems</li>\n<li>Most SPICE models for Power ICs that electrical engineers find on the Internet were created by AEi Systems, including those found on the websites of ON Semiconductor and Texas Instruments and used via National Semiconductor&#8217;s online Webench tool</li>\n<li>AEi Systems analyzed the power buss for the International Space Station</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Defense and Aerospace Projects</p>\n\n<p>AEi Systems has been involved in the development and analysis of some of the most sophisticated and technically challenging power systems in the world, both in the space and defense arena and also with respect to commercial and industrial applications. The company has provided computer simulation models and worst case circuit analysis on most projects. Many projects are &#8220;dark&#8221; but among the company&#8217;s publicly-known projects are:</p>\n\n<p>BSAT, CMIS, Globalstar, GMI, Goes, GPS, HS-702, Intellsat, Juno, MCI, Milstar, MSV, MUOS. NPOESS, Omegasat, P1196, P-81, SMMA, SMU, Spaceway, Tempo, Virgo, XPC</p>\n\n<p>Commercial and Scientific Projects </p>\n\n<p>AEi Systems&#8217; power supply analysis and design expertise has also been sought for commercial and industrial projects not involving space or defense. For example, AEi Systems worked on the following projects (we can name):</p>\n\n<p>The upgrading and revision of the failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world&#8217;s largest and most powerful particle accelerator that &#8220;uncovered&#8221; the Higgs Boson)</p>\n\n<p>Darwin (Schilling Robotics), a 100kW Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) that operates underneath the North Sea under 17 kPSI at over 6 kM; and </p>\n\n<p>Commercial projects for Bosch, DeLL and EMC.</p>\n\n<p>SPICE Modeling</p>\n\n<p>AEi Systems provides SPICE models to many major IC manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor and National Semiconductor. Many can be seen on (and downloaded from) their websites. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2005, this business unit has produced and distributed the Power IC Model Library for PSpice, which is distributed by Cadence&#8217;s sole North American distributor (EMA-EDA) in the United States and Canada, and by other major distributors in Asia and Europe.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0010/1682/101682v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,190],"assets/images/resized/0010/1682/101682v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,342],"assets/images/resized/0010/1682/101682v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Power IC Model Library for PSpice ","permalink":"power-ic-model-library-for-pspice","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Hymowitz","permalink":"charles-hymowitz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Weinberg","permalink":"lee-weinberg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0010/0729/100729v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0010/0729/100729v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0010/0729/100729v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>LMW</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"5933 W.
