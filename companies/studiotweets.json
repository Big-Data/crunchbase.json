Tracking so many tweets and opinions has become almost impossible due to the sheer volume and nature of tweets that individuals mention.  This causes a problem as this means that people are going to overlook really interesting tweets (sometimes even from the artists themselves!).</p>\n\n<p>StudioTweets.com aims to fix this problem by using its own Sentiment Engine to turn Twitter into a fully fledged music critic.  </p>\n\n<p>StudioTweets allows people to view music orientated tweets based upon who they are following as well as the twitter community as a whole.  StudioTweets also lets Users rate an individualâ€™s taste in music.  Furthermore, StudioTweets harnesses Twitter to facilitate reviews and ratings on musical content.</p>\n\n<p>Users only need their existing Twitter login information to sign up.  Each Userâ€™s profile allows them to view what their friends are saying about music.  The site will also have profiles for Albums and individual songs, containing a Rating, Positive and Negative Tweets (categorised by our sentiment engine), Tweets by friends and much more.  Users will also have the option to purchase an album or individual songs.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing musical interests is also a key aspect of the site, which is why StudioTweets allows users to publish a link to their StudioTweets profile either on somebody elses Twitter Profile or as a status update on their own profile.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0013/7679/137679v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/7679/137679v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,145],"assets/images/resized/0013/7679/137679v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Asantha","last_name":"De Alwis","permalink":"asantha-de-alwis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Neophytou","permalink":"nick-neophytou","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Private","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":30,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
