The firm is the exclusive advisor to the Canepa Global TMT Fund, seeking to invest $10m-$50m into TMT companies with enterprise value of $50-250m. HGP and the Canepa Global TMT Fund bring a combination of long term capital, extensive operational management skills and financial asset management experience to each situation.  As such HGP views itself more as a strategic partner than a purely financial investor.  HGP is flexible with respect to control vs. minority stakes but will only consider situations where there is an opportunity to drive growth through its active involvement.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0020/2797/202797v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,31],"assets/images/resized/0020/2797/202797v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,56],"assets/images/resized/0020/2797/202797v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
