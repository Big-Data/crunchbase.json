We believe social analytics can accurately depict human behaviors like Influence and Generosity, and that the openness and transparency of social networks will be the catalyst for the next great leap in community and productivity. </p>\n\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n\n<p>Social media nurtures collaboration and openness, and fundamentally changes the way humans interact and coexist.  </p>\n\n<p>PeopleBrowsr’s mission is to assemble the collective intelligence provided by social media, make it accessible and easily understood by anyone that wishes to use it, and ultimately revolutionize the way we connect, solve problems and build global communities.  </p>\n\n<p>The motivation for our choices - whether competitive or collaborative - has historically been survival.  There are innumerable examples where the drive to survive forced individuals and communities to act against the greater good.  </p>\n\n<p>In the past two decades, technological innovations have surfaced that fortify our better natures, decrease our selfish tendencies and bring the world closer together.  It started with the Internet and email.  Now social and mobile platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Path and Highlight foster collaboration by simplifying the discovery of like-minded people.</p>\n\n<p>Cooperation requires that we trust and understand each other. PeopleBrowsr collects, filters and indexes the vast flow of digital conversations to provide a shareable source of open social data and trust metrics that facilitate collaboration.  This gives us personal insights that nurture relationships and help us get to know each other more rapidly.  </p>\n\n<p>Today’s innovative technologies will be most effective in an open environment.  When we are open and honest with each other, we will build a greater global connection and community.  This is why we have made the values of transparency and Universal Data Access core to everything we do, both our products and how we do business.  </p>\n\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n\n<p>PeopleBrowsr products and services:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://kred.com/\" title=\"Kred\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kred</a>: Kred is the only social scoring system built on the values of Transparency, Relevancy and Community.
