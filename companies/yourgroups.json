Yourgroups is not an open social network with public profiles, finding people, etc.  Rather yourgroups is for that inner circle of friends, family, co-workers, etc that you need to regularly interact with and donâ€™t want your communications broadcast to others. </p>\n\n<p>Yourgroups is invite only.  Once you have registered anyone can create a group and invite people.  The person receiving the invite must accept the invitation to ever become part of the group. </p>\n\n<p>Once a group is created only those invited and that accepted can communicate and share with that group.  In fact people outside of your group will not even know it exist! </p>\n\n<p>You can create or join multiple groups, but there is no sharing of information between groups.  For example lets say you have a group for your five best friends, a family group and a group for your softball team.  Your friends data can never be seen by people in your family group, softball group canâ€™t see your family, and so on.  Yourgroups was developed specifically like this to allow very open communications between a social circle.  In other words feel free to express yourself, no need to worry your best friends mom is going to view something you prefer she wouldnâ€™t see.</p>\n\n<p>Each group provides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>push messages to the group</p></li>\n<li><p>Send offline messages to the group</p></li>\n<li><p>create events for the group (future or immediate) </p></li>\n<li><p>share pictures with the group</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your groups can be accessed via a desktop computer, iPhone app, other smartphones or tablets that have capable browsers (Android, Nokia, etc). </p>\n\n<p>Full Website â€“ www.yourgroups.com</p>\n\n<p>Mobile Website -  www.yourgroups.com/m/ </p>\n\n<p>Access via iPhone app â€“ http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yourgroups/id430138697?mt=8</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Brandon","last_name":"Frank","permalink":"brandon-frank","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Mars","permalink":"scott-mars","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Payne","permalink":"josh-payne-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Tice","permalink":"jason-tice","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Morrison","permalink":"eric-morrison","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"GroupMe","permalink":"groupme","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0009/9345/99345v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0009/9345/99345v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0009/9345/99345v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Fast Society","permalink":"fast-society","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0009/7646/97646v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,213],"assets/images/resized/0009/7646/97646v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,383],"assets/images/resized/0009/7646/97646v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Beluga","permalink":"beluga","image":{"available_sizes":[[[72,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/8757/108757v4-max-150x150.png"],[[72,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/8757/108757v4-max-250x250.png"],[[72,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/8757/108757v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
