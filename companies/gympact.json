If they meet their Pact by checking in at their gym with our Smartphone app, they receive cash rewards, paid for by those who did not exercise!  Members get a double incentive to get to the gym, and GymPact takes a cut when we pay out to members who successfully met their Pact.</p>\n\n<p>GymPact is the only fitness technology to use both positive and negative incentives, and that has allowed us to be 90% effective at getting people in our pilots to the gym and to give real rewards using the money paid by non-exercisers.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0016/9187/169187v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0016/9187/169187v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,77],"assets/images/resized/0016/9187/169187v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Yifan","last_name":"Zhang","permalink":"yifan-zhang","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Geoff","last_name":"Oberhofer","permalink":"geoff-oberhofer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Anuprit","last_name":"Kale","permalink":"anuprit-kale","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$968k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/gympact-seed-round/","source_description":"GymPact Grabs $850K From Guitar Hero Founder & More To Give You Cash For Getting In Shape","raised_amount":850000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":28,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Hirshland","permalink":"mike-hirshland-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"TEEC Angel Fund","permalink":"teec-angel-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0012/6955/126955v2-max-150x150.png"],[[187,113],"assets/images/resized/0012/6955/126955v2-max-250x250.png"],[[187,113],"assets/images/resized/0012/6955/126955v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Dornbrook","permalink":"mike-dornbrook","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Rigopulos","permalink":"alex-rigopulos","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Mason","permalink":"bob-mason","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techstars.com/companies/stats","source_description":"TechStars","raised_amount":118000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9184/169184v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/9184/169184v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/9184/169184v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9185/169185v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/9185/169185v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/9185/169185v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0016/9186/169186v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0016/9186/169186v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,449],"assets/images/resized/0016/9186/169186v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/01/gympact-launches-to-help-you-keep-your-fitness-resolutions-by-paying-if-you-dont/","title":"Techcrunch "},{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2012/01/01/gympact-keep-it-or-pay/","title":"Mashable"},{"external_url":"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/gym-pact-fines-you-for-not-exercising/","title":"NY Times Blog"}]}
