After dialing into the conference number, anyone in the call can see the names, photos, and other information of the others in the call from any computer. The display shows the current speaker, and the organizer has a number of helpful tools to keep the conference running smoothly. They can record calls, mute participants to get rid of background noise or put “earmuffs” on people they may not want to hear part of the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>UberConference is audio conferencing done right.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0019/0851/190851v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0019/0851/190851v1-max-250x250.png"],[[294,58],"assets/images/resized/0019/0851/190851v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Walker","permalink":"craig-walker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0009/2452/92452v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0009/2452/92452v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0009/2452/92452v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Alex Cornell</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Pleasanton","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"UberConference wins the third annual TechCrunch Disrupt NYC.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":23,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/uberconference-wins-techcrunch-disrupt-nyc/","source_text":"","source_description":"And The Winner Of The Third Annual TechCrunch Disrupt NYC Is UberConference","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"UberConference","permalink":"uberconference"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"322\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NhJHAK80n38\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>UberConference: Simple, Visual, Free </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0019/0849/190849v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0019/0849/190849v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,273],"assets/images/resized/0019/0849/190849v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
