The business owners get to watch the enthusiasm, traction, support, and success develop in real-time—then they can share it all with investors and other members of the community to continue growing support.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0022/0278/220278v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0022/0278/220278v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,101],"assets/images/resized/0022/0278/220278v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Zell","permalink":"kevin-zell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Beninson","permalink":"jonathan-beninson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brendan","last_name":"Karp","permalink":"brendan-karp","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director/Advisor","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Daltner","permalink":"john-daltner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director/Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"R.
