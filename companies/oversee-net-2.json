Sites include LowFares.com, FareSpotter.net, AboutAirportParking.com, CreditCards.org, BadCreditOffers.com, ShopWiki.com and CouponFinder.com.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, its DomainSponsor business unit was the first to offer owners of undeveloped domain names the opportunity to monetize the direct navigation, organic traffic hitting their domains.  Its self-learning technology platform displays highly relevant PPC ads on these undeveloped domains.  The combination of strong direct navigation/organic user intent and highly relevant PPC ads produces favorable conversion rates for online advertisers.  In January 2011, it announced a new technological development that expands beyond PPC to now include CPA and CPV monetization options for publishers.  This new technology also allows advertisers to directly bid on and acquire the traffic on on the DomainSponsor platform.  </p>\n\n<p>Oversee.net was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California with additional offices in New York City and Frankfurt, Germany.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0009/1673/91673v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/1673/91673v4-max-250x250.png"],[[324,65],"assets/images/resized/0009/1673/91673v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"DomainSponsor.com","permalink":"domainsponsor-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Debra","last_name":"Domeyer","permalink":"debra-domeyer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/5150/195150v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,225],"assets/images/resized/0019/5150/195150v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,225],"assets/images/resized/0019/5150/195150v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-CEO and Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Debra","last_name":"Domeyer","permalink":"debra-domeyer-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-CEO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Morrow","permalink":"scott-morrow-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"c0-founder, Dir Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"Sheridan","permalink":"ron-sheridan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[60,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/0024/30024v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[60,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/0024/30024v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[60,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/0024/30024v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Oversee.net</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-CEO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Morrow","permalink":"scott-morrow-3","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Sr. BD / Recruiter","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Stomel","permalink":"josh-stomel","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Director","person":{"first_name":"Jothan","last_name":"Frakes","permalink":"jothan-frakes","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"515 South Flower Street","address2":"Suite 4400","zip_code":"90071","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Debra Domeyer Appointed CEO","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":2,"source_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oversee-net-appoints-debra-domeyer-193500914.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Oversee.net Appoints Debra Domeyer Chief Executive Officer","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Oversee.net","permalink":"oversee-net-2"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0018/5767/185767v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0018/5767/185767v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,378],"assets/images/resized/0018/5767/185767v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
