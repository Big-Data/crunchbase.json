Fans promote for the artists they love and earn a cut of the action. </p>\n\n<p>Posse.com is the world&#8217;s first platform for brands to empower and reward their fans for spreading the word online. Posse launched as a tool for the Australian music industry in August 2010 with the support of Ticketmaster, Moshtix, MTV and MySpace. Posse will launch in the UK in August 2011 and the US in late 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Posse&#8217;s initial focus is to enable bands and music events to encourage, measure and communicate their top fans to promote their tickets and music through social networks. Some early users of Posse include Good Vibrations, Future Music, Good Charlotte, EMI Music, Unwritten Law, Korn and several others. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/8999/88999v8-max-150x150.png"],[[100,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/8999/88999v8-max-250x250.png"],[[100,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/8999/88999v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rebekah","last_name":"Campbell","permalink":"rebekah-campbell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"James","permalink":"rob-james","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Rohan","permalink":"rob-rohan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Web Developer","person":{"first_name":"Mitch","last_name":"Malone","permalink":"mitch-malone","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-news/industry/2010/09/09/posse-com-secure-new-backers-emi-partnership/","source_description":"Posse.com secure new backers","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":9,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Artesian Capital Management","permalink":"artesian-capital-management","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0020/6726/206726v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0020/6726/206726v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,153],"assets/images/resized/0020/6726/206726v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sydney Office","address1":"Room 10","address2":"285a Crown St","zip_code":"2000","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://springwise.com/entertainment/posse/","title":"Fans paid for promoting bands upcoming concerts"},{"external_url":"http://www.news.com.au/business/business-owner/selling-tickets-to-online-social-networks-a-win-win-for-bands-fans/story-e6frfm5i-1225915118056","title":"Selling tickets to on-line social networks a win-win for bands/fans"},{"external_url":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/social-marketing-website-posse-corrals-fans-to-sell-concerts-online/story-e6frg996-1225914479850","title":"Social marketing website Posse corrals fans to sell concerts online"},{"external_url":"http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-news/industry/2010/09/09/posse-com-secure-new-backers-emi-partnership/","title":"Posse.com secure new backers, EMI partnership"},{"external_url":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/business-owner/selling-tickets-to-online-social-networks-a-win-win-for-bands-fans/story-e6freqn6-1225915118056","title":"Selling tickets to online social networks a win-win for bands, fans"},{"external_url":"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/band-manager-nets-fans-to-peddle-wares-for-their-favourite-artists-20101021-16w5b.html","title":"Band manager nets fans to peddle wares for their favourite artists "}]}
