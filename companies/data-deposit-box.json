Data Deposit Box then runs invisibly in the background and engages when the computer is connected to the Internet, continuously monitoring selected folders. </p>\n\n<p>Data Deposit Box, which received a patent for continuous online backup in July, is automatic. When a change is detected, it is immediately extracted, compressed, encrypted and then securely transferred to a remote server. After creating a backup with Data Deposit Box, customers investing in this service can securely access files remotely from any web browser. </p>\n\n<p>In September 2008, Data Deposit Box launched its Open Files program that backs up open and in-use files which, in the past, were skipped during the backup process. This software backs up these files on a regular basis, ensuring business continuity, even if someone forgets to close an application. Other services generally skip open and in-use files during the backup process, putting your most current data at risk. This important feature is offered at no extra cost â€“ itâ€™s part of your standard Data Deposit Box package â€“ and you can easily install the Open Files Driver by selecting the Open Files tab under &#8220;Options&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Data Deposit Box is also incredibly secure. All files are protected using 448 bit Blowfish Bank Grade Encryption which has never been cracked. Files are encrypted before they even leave your PC and stored remotely in DDBâ€™s state of the art data center on RAID 5 disk arrays. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0003/5697/35697v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0003/5697/35697v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[368,104],"assets/images/resized/0003/5697/35697v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Continous BackupTM","permalink":"continous-online-backup","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Technology Director","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Schenkel","permalink":"rob-schenkel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jamie","last_name":"Brenzel","permalink":"jamie-brenzel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Jewell","permalink":"tim-jewell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"M.W.","last_name":"(Peggy) Bennett","permalink":"m-w-peggy-bennett","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Carbonite","permalink":"carbonite","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mozy","permalink":"mozy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/0982/982v1-max-150x150.png"],[[206,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/0982/982v1-max-250x250.png"],[[206,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/0982/982v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Symantec","permalink":"symantec","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/7569/17569v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[226,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7569/17569v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[226,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7569/17569v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"NovaStor","permalink":"novastor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0009/1270/91270v1-max-150x150.png"],[[205,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/1270/91270v1-max-250x250.png"],[[205,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/1270/91270v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Public Relations","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Just Drive Media","permalink":"just-drive-media","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"1 Eglinton Avenue East  ","address2":"Toronto","zip_code":"M4P 3A1","city":"Ontario","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":43.7067486,"longitude":-79.3982862},{"description":"U.S. Office","address1":"935 Park Avenue","address2":"Suite 1D","zip_code":"10028","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.776663,"longitude":-73.959258}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.byteandswitch.com/document.asp?doc_id=169427&f_src=byteandswitch_default","title":"Byte & Switch: \"Sifting Through Online Backup Service Options\""},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/business/businessspecial2/20storage.html","title":"New York Times: So Much Data, So Many Ways to Guard It"},{"external_url":"http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/Data-Deposit-Box-Stores-Data-Safely-OffSite/","title":"eWeek: Data Deposit Box Stores Data Safely Off-Site"},{"external_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/technology/managingtechnology/web20columnistfrankbell/article189742.html","title":"Entrepreneur: Online Storage Options"}]}
