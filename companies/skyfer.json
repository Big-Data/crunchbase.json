No more browsing internet for companies that are no longer in business, or wasting time on the phone. Status availability, location, and service request expiration are the three key components of the Skyfer platform that will ensure your message is received by a company located within specified radius and is available to perform the work requested based on your time-frame. Public profiles and ratings will help deciding if a service provider can be trusted to do the job.</p>\n\n<p>If you are someone who wants to earn a few extra bucks by doing projects in your neighborhood, Skyfer is the only the place where you can transform your skills to services and offer them to your local community. Decide which projects you want to respond to, and then get in touch with a third party without sacrificing your privacy.</p>\n\n<p>It can be said, then, that Skyfer is a true community tool that can let neighbors bind closer and professionals market their services in a really localized way. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0012/0396/120396v2-max-150x150.png"],[[247,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/0396/120396v2-max-250x250.png"],[[247,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/0396/120396v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Romanov","permalink":"gary-romanov","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Dmitry","last_name":"Kroz","permalink":"dmitry-kroz","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"TaskRabbit","permalink":"taskrabbit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0009/9366/99366v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0009/9366/99366v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,113],"assets/images/resized/0009/9366/99366v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Zaarly","permalink":"zaarly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/3732/123732v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0012/3732/123732v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,197],"assets/images/resized/0012/3732/123732v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Virginia Office","address1":"1934 Old Gallows Rd Suite 350 ","address2":"","zip_code":"22182","city":"Vienna","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/k3mj4Eb88MA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Skyfer - How it Works</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0395/120395v2-max-150x150.png"],[[206,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/0395/120395v2-max-250x250.png"],[[372,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/0395/120395v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Mobile/skyfer-com-list-your-services-take-offers","title":"Skyfer - List Your Service & Take Offers"},{"external_url":"http://visionwiz.net/2011/01/android-user-%E2%80%93get-help-based-on-your-current-location-in-real-time/","title":"Android user â€“Get help based on your current location in real time "},{"external_url":"http://thedroidguy.com/2011/05/disrupt-nyc-coverage-skyfer/","title":"Disrupt NYC Coverage: Skyfer"}]}
