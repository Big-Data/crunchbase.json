Although its birth name, The Indus Entrepreneurs, signifies the ethnic South Asian or Indus roots of the founders. TiE stands for Talent, Ideas and Enterprise. It is an open and inclusive organization that has rapidly grown to more than 53 chapters in 12 countries. TiE seeks to cultivate and nurture the ecosystem of entrepreneurship and free-market economies everywhere, as it sees this to be the single most powerful instrument of prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>Besides its flagship event, TiECon&#8211;the largest professional conference for entrepreneurs, TiE now has a wide range of programs including Special Interest Groups (SIGs), TiE Institute, Growth Company Forum and most recently, TiE Womenâ€™s Forum and CEO Forum.</p>\n\n<p>Membership fees, event fees, and contributions from sponsors financially support TiE. These sponsors include some of the biggest names among corporations and service providers (venture capital, law, accounting, and consulting). They are also actively involved in various programs for TiE members while elected officials and volunteers manage the TiE operations and activities.</p>\n\n<p>The membership structure of TiE includes Charter Members, who are invited based on their accomplishments and willingness to help the next generation of entrepreneurs. The general membership of TiE is open to anyone who pays nominal dues and can thus access the various activities and services, including mentoring by Charter Members.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,83],"assets/images/resized/0013/4356/134356v1-max-150x150.png"],[[112,83],"assets/images/resized/0013/4356/134356v1-max-250x250.png"],[[112,83],"assets/images/resized/0013/4356/134356v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/12/claritics-raises-1-5-million-for-cloud-based-analytics-apps/","source_description":"Claritics Raises $1.5 Million For Cloud-Based Analytics Apps","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"Claritics","permalink":"claritics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0013/4286/134286v1-max-150x150.png"],[[226,60],"assets/images/resized/0013/4286/134286v1-max-250x250.png"],[[226,60],"assets/images/resized/0013/4286/134286v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2903 Bunker Hill Lane","address2":"Suite 150","zip_code":"95054","city":"Santa Clara","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/4358/134358v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0013/4358/134358v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0013/4358/134358v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
