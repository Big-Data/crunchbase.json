We&#8217;ll bring you together and make sure you meet the right job or the right candidate. It&#8217;s about time someone set out to do something different.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Wiseri is a job search platform which has a simple and sincere goal: to help as many people as possible find a job and to help businesses find the best candidates. The wiseri selection process ensures that candidates are only presented to companies where they have a good chance of being offered a job, and conversely, that companies are only presented with candidates with the skills and experience they are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2011, wiseri.com secured a round of investment worth 120,000 euros which was provided by 17 investors, all of whom are involved in the digital industries. Crucially for wiseri, this meant they brought to the company not only their money, but also their expertise and experience in the industry. In similar style to the way businesses in Silicon Valley secure seed capital, this investment round did not involve any outside investors or investment funds; but rather, the funds were provided by people who know and believe in what wiseri does. Furthermore, the round of investment was carried out from start to finish in a record time of 37 days and all communication between wiseri and its investors was conducted through email with complete transparency.</p>\n\n<p>On 14th January 2012, wiseri revealed a new side of its online platform, a system that sources talent from the crowd to form an expert selection team. In doing so, wiseri became the first company in the job search industry to incorporate gamification and crowdsourcing into its system. Members of the selection team are called Wisors and any job application made through wiseri.com first has to pass through the hands of a Wisor, who selects only those applications best matched to the job position and presents them to the company, taking care to give genuine and useful feedback to each candidate who didn&#8217;t quite make it to ensure they have a better chance the next time round. And to make sure that the applications are checked by someone who knows what they&#8217;re doing, only people who have already passed through the wiseri application system can go on to become Wisors; and once you are a Wisor, well, then you can enjoy a whole range of perks along the way, saving up wirees (wiseri&#8217;s currency) as you go that you can cash in for a whole load of prizes.?</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Technical
