PWA&#8217;s goal is to make users daily life easier and more productive in keeping them up to date with the latest and greatest the web has to offer.</p>\n\n<p>PWA are an interactive directory thatâ€™s distinct from other web app review sites. While a lot of blogs and news sites may cover individual applications, until now there was no one place where you could go to search, compare, rate and comment on hundreds of web apps.</p>\n\n<p>PWA make sure to categorize each web app, provide a brief overview of what the app does and outline the appâ€™s key features so users are able to find what you are looking for in the shortest and easiest way possible.</p>\n\n<p>PWA wants to help users who love web tools and apps discover new and exciting sites and make it as easy for developers to get their word out there and build traffic to their app. If a web app a user is looking for is not on PWA or a developer would like to submit their own site or app, they are able to do so on the Submit a Site page.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0016/0748/160748v2-max-150x150.png"],[[217,124],"assets/images/resized/0016/0748/160748v2-max-250x250.png"],[[217,124],"assets/images/resized/0016/0748/160748v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Purcell","permalink":"scott-purcell-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Go2Web20","permalink":"go2web20","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0000/3541/3541v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[237,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/3541/3541v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[237,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/3541/3541v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Appsfire","permalink":"appsfire","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/1514/51514v4-max-150x150.png"],[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/1514/51514v4-max-250x250.png"],[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/1514/51514v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sydney","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0016/0747/160747v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,162],"assets/images/resized/0016/0747/160747v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,293],"assets/images/resized/0016/0747/160747v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.productivewebapps.com/about-us","title":"About Us"},{"external_url":"http://www.productivewebapps.com/blog/wtf-is-a-web-app/","title":"WTF is a Web App"},{"external_url":"http://www.productivewebapps.com/blog/introducing-productive-web-apps/","title":"Introducing Productive Web Apps"}]}
