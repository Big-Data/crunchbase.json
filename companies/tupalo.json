Registered users are able to collect friends and businesses in a social network environment, as well as create custom sets, which act as mini-city guides. In addition, registered users are able to edit local business entries in a wiki-like environment and participate in city, or topic-focused discussion groups. </p>\n\n<p>The two founders of Tupalo were
