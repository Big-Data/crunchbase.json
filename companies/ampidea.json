The sleep scheduling monitor keeps a record of when the baby is sleeping and waking up over time. This helps the parents schedule when to put the baby down for naps and night time sleep. AmpIdea sells the monitor hardware and charges for additional services.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0005/9512/59512v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,68],"assets/images/resized/0005/9512/59512v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,68],"assets/images/resized/0005/9512/59512v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$18k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/10/techstars-debuts-nine-startups-in-boston/","source_description":"TechStars Debuts Nine Startups In Boston","raised_amount":18000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"TechStars","permalink":"techstars","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-150x150.png"],[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-250x250.png"],[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0005/9513/59513v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0005/9513/59513v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,238],"assets/images/resized/0005/9513/59513v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
