BoostCTR offers a money-back guarantee so that advertisers only pay for ads that beat the performance of their best existing ads.  </p>\n\n<p>How it Works: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Advertisers purchase credits and select which ad groups they want to optimize.</li>\n<li>Next, advertisers review a multitude of writer ad submissions and approve ads that they want to test, and reject the others.</li>\n<li>BoostCTR automatically tests submitted ads using objective success metric.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Value Proposition:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Risk-Free: There are no setup fees, and BoostCTR offers a money back guarantee.</li>\n<li>Increase Profit: Click through rate is the most important factor in quality score. </li>\n<li>Save Time: BoostCTR&#8217;s automated system runs contests 24/7,
