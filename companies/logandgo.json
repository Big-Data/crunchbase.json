By clicking on the envelope a browser opens and the envelope reappears, turns around and opens.  Out comes the invitation card or cards (if the host chose to send more than one or created an event with multiple invitations).  The guest can then watch and celebrate his invitation, just like opening a letter invitation after coming home. To maximise the celebration hosts can also choose to add music to the card(s) display. This is especially fun for theme invitations or fashion shows etc. After watching or clicking through the cards the guest reaches the event site, where he finds all the info he needs, ranging from â€œHomeâ€, â€œProgramâ€, â€œLocationâ€, â€œRSVPâ€, Guestsâ€, â€œGiftsâ€, â€œContactâ€, â€œMore infoâ€, â€œPhotosâ€, â€œVideosâ€  and much more.\nEK offers hosts special and unique tools to make the creation of his invitation cards, event site and guest list fun and easy and help him manage his guest list or his contacts after the invitation has been sent.  A host can either choose from the many classy templates EK offers, upload his own designs or ask EK to design special cards or event sites for him. In his guest list a host can see exactly which guests have viewed their invites or cancelled or accepted the invitation. If a guest e.g. RSVPs by phone the host can manually edit the RSVP status. The host can also manually manage the guest list, e.g. adding accompanies to guests or sending reminder messages for guests to RSVP. If certain guests to not answer or didnâ€™t receive their invite, EK offers various communication services, to make like easier for the host, e.g. telephone and SMS services in cooperation with JAJAH. So, right up until the event starts the host had a great management tool and can then print out or export  his guestlist. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0004/0627/40627v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0004/0627/40627v1-max-250x250.png"],[[278,59],"assets/images/resized/0004/0627/40627v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"digital invitations","permalink":"digital-invitations","image":null},{"name":"digital cards","permalink":"digital-cards","image":null},{"name":"stand alone event sites","permalink":"stand-alone-event-sites","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"founder","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"von Ribbentrop","permalink":"patrick-von-ribbentrop","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Berlin office","address1":"Kantstr. 150","address2":"","zip_code":"10623","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":52.5056075,"longitude":13.3252018}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9806/29806v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9806/29806v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9806/29806v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9807/29807v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9807/29807v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9807/29807v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9808/29808v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9808/29808v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9808/29808v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9809/29809v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9809/29809v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9809/29809v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9810/29810v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9810/29810v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9810/29810v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9811/29811v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9811/29811v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9811/29811v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9812/29812v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0002/9812/29812v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0002/9812/29812v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0004/0628/40628v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,155],"assets/images/resized/0004/0628/40628v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,280],"assets/images/resized/0004/0628/40628v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
