It allows the two parties to connect directly with less noise.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of journalism is finding the right people. Members of the media need to find subject matter experts on a daily basis. They work under tight deadlines, what they are looking for constantly changes, and they are rarely subject matter experts themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, organizations and those with expertise often spend large sums of money to garner the attention of journalists. Media attention helps individuals and companies become perceived as leaders, which indirectly leads to increased revenue.</p>\n\n<p>We are introducing a frictionless way for journalists to solve a central pain point and for others to get hassle free media attention. mediaspot.me is a paradigm shift in the sleepy (and lucrative) public relations world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2820/182820v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/2820/182820v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0018/2820/182820v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Stavros","last_name":"Rougas","permalink":"stavros-rougas","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/3787/183787v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/3787/183787v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[391,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/3787/183787v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>mediaspot.me</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ebrahim","last_name":"Ashrafizadeh","permalink":"ebrahim-ashrafizadeh","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"LinkedIn","permalink":"linkedin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/1055/11055v23-max-150x150.png"],[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/1055/11055v23-max-250x250.png"],[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/1055/11055v23-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Public Insight Network","permalink":"public-insight-network","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Waterloo, Ontario office","address1":"151 Charles Street West, Suite 100","address2":"","zip_code":"M4S 2J7","city":"Kitchener, Ontario","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.cdmn.ca/have-expertise-get-found-by-journalists-with-mediaspot-me/","title":"author: Canadian Digital Media Network"}]}
