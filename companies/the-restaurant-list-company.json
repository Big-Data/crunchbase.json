The List gives these hotel guests specific restaurant choices near the hotel and a map showing how to get there.</p>\n\n<p>â€œWith The List, a hotel can provide its guests with a choice of over 30 restaurants, in all dining categories and prices,â€ said Marc Fortune, co-founder of The Restaurant List Company.  â€œAnd they have a professionally printed document with a map on the back to show where each restaurant is in proximity to the hotel, as well as local attractions.â€  Investors have also seen the wisdom of the simple business put together by Fortune and Gould as the Restaurant List Company has raised $1.6 million in startup capital.  The investment was led by Solidus Company with participation from Nashville Capital Network angels, the NCN Angel Fund, and a number of individual Nashville and Atlanta investors.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking for Solidus, Managing Partner Townes Duncan said, â€œThe Restaurant List Company is the perfect type of investment for Solidus Partners.  It is simple to understand, it is built for the long-term, and the principals have proven in past ventures that they know how to build value.  We are excited about the companyâ€™s growth potential over the next few years.â€</p>\n\n<p>Sid Chambless, executive director of Nashville Capital Network, commented on the investment in The Restaurant List Company: â€œNashville Capital Network has a long standing relationship with the management team of The Restaurant List Company.  Because of their track record and the promise of this opportunity, NCNâ€™s fund joined several of our angel group members in helping capitalize the company.â€</p>\n\n<p>Gould and Fortune are currently launching their product in the Nashville area and are planning to be in at least five Southeast markets by the end of 2009. They are planning a national launch within the first two years of operation.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0012/8275/128275v2-max-150x150.png"],[[220,30],"assets/images/resized/0012/8275/128275v2-max-250x250.png"],[[220,30],"assets/images/resized/0012/8275/128275v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Nashville","state_code":"TN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
