The initial service was phone service over dialup internet for customers in remote areas of the world where making a phone call to the United States, for example, was much as five dollars per minute. </p>\n\n<p>In 2000, the CTO and President Rehan Ahmed invented the &#8220;virtual phone line&#8221; (trademarked) which empowered voIP customers to be have a phone number ring to an IP phone or IP phone adapter. The following year, Spring Internet World in Los Angeles, Ca. awarded Virtual Phone Line with the Best of Show Client Device award.
