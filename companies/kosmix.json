The site (www.kosmix.com) lets users explore the Web by topic, presenting a dashboard of relevant videos, photos, news, commentary, opinion, communities and links to related topics.  Kosmixâ€™s categorization engine organizes the Internet into magazine-style topic pages, enabling people to navigate the Web even if they donâ€™t know exactly what theyâ€™re looking for. </p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Mountain View, California, Kosmix was founded in 2005 by Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman. Harinarayan and Rajaraman were co-founders of Junglee, the first shopping search engine which was acquired by Amazon.com in 1998.  They later created Amazon.com&#8217;s Mechanical Turk. </p>\n\n<p>Kosmix is funded by Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Dag Ventures and Jeff Bezosâ€™ personal investment company, Bezos Expeditions.   </p>\n\n<p>Kosmix began as a vertical search engine, initially introducing health site www.RightHealth.com as a proof-of-concept for the Kosmix approach to Web navigation.  RightHealth is now the #2 health site on the Web, according to Hitwise.  In June 2008, Kosmix expanded its focus from vertical to a complete horizontal play.

for information about health, automobiles and travel, transformed itself into a universal search engine for all subjects earlier today during a general redesign.\r\n\r\nThe move has been anticipated since at least last September, and was described by co-founder Anand Rajaraman in a Beet.tv interview posted less than a week ago.\r\n\r\nNow when users conduct keyword searches on Kosmix (much as they would on a traditional search engine like Google or Ask), they are presented with mashups of results from a variety of sources. Unlike Mahalo, Kosmix itself doesnâ€™t publish any of the content it displays. Rather, it pulls it all from services like Flickr, Google, Wikipedia, TheFind, Yahoo Answers, Amazon, Truveo, and YouTube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults from each of these sources are shown in their own modules, which are packed rather tightly in a three column layout. We hear that there are hundreds of possible modules, although only a small subset of these show up for each query.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a particular result type (videos, photos, blogs, etc), you can expand it into its own page for better browsing. Kosmix also suggests related searches in each of these views for when you want to jump around between â€œtopicsâ€ as you would on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nIn his Beet.tv interview, Rajaraman claimed 15 million unique visitors per month for Kosmix. The vast majority of these visitors appears to be heading to RightHealth, Kosmixâ€™s health vertical site that competes with the likes of iMedix, OrganizedHealth, and others. According to Compete, Kosmix.com attracts only about 50-100 thousand visitors per month. If the Mountain View startup is to succeed at this horizontal strategy, itâ€™ll have to focus on marketing its main property more effectively going forward.\r\n\r\nKosmixâ€™s other remaining vertical sites include RightAutos and RightTrips.
