Everyone should be able to contribute - no matter the size of the donation - and the best way to reach a broad donor base is to use social networks that already exist. When friends ask friends for support, a positive response is 10 times more likely, and the resulting gift is 52% higher. Most organizations have understood this dynamic for some time but were limited in their ability to organize and manage volunteer fundraising at scale. Fundly&#8217;s platform has scaled to support thousands of volunteer fundraisers for a single organization, with each fundraiser leveraging their own personal social network.</p>\n\n<p>To date, Fundly has helped over $25,000 organizations raise more than $250 million.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/1721/101721v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0010/1721/101721v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,119],"assets/images/resized/0010/1721/101721v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief
