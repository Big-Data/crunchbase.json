The companyâ€™s technology harnesses the power of the human immune system to identify naturally evolved monoclonal antibodies from the blood cells of immunologically relevant human subjects. Recombinant human monoclonal antibodies can be rapidly obtained using our discovery platform and scaled for large-scale industrial production. Such antibody drug candidates may be uniquely important in combating disease and may have potential as therapeutic products that can be administered to a broad patient population. Theraclone is a privately held company with venture investment from ARCH Venture Partners, Canaan Partners, Healthcare Ventures, Amgen Ventures, MPM Capital, and Alexandria Real Estate Investment.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0009/4651/94651v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0009/4651/94651v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[305,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/4651/94651v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Chairman and Acting President","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Gillis","permalink":"steven-gillis-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Russ","last_name":"Hawkinson","permalink":"russ-hawkinson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$12.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2010/03/19/theraclone-raises-1-5m/","source_description":"Theraclone Raises $1.5M","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Alexandria Real Estate Equities","permalink":"alexandria-real-estate-equities","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/2582/52582v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[235,82],"assets/images/resized/0005/2582/52582v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[235,82],"assets/images/resized/0005/2582/52582v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Amgen Ventures","permalink":"amgen-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"MPM Capital","permalink":"mpm-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0004/5561/45561v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,171],"assets/images/resized/0004/5561/45561v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,171],"assets/images/resized/0004/5561/45561v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"ARCH Venture Partners","permalink":"arch-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-150x150.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-250x250.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Canaan Partners","permalink":"canaan-partners-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3958/3958v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/3958/3958v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,147],"assets/images/resized/0000/3958/3958v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"HealthCare Ventures","permalink":"healthcare-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0004/9268/49268v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0004/9268/49268v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[290,40],"assets/images/resized/0004/9268/49268v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/theraclone-makes-good-106m-vc-financing-plan/2011-09-08?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss","source_description":"Theraclone makes good on $10.6M VC financing plan","raised_amount":10600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":8,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Seattle Life Sciences Building","address2":"1124 Columbia Street, Suite 300","zip_code":"98104","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Theraclone Sciences Strikes $632M Research Deal With Pfizer","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":19,"source_url":"https://www.fis.dowjones.com/article.aspx?ProductIDFromApplication=29&aid=DJFVLS0020110120e71k00004&r=Rss&s=DJFVLS","source_text":"","source_description":"Theraclone Sciences Strikes $632M Research Deal With Pfizer","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Theraclone Sciences","permalink":"theraclone-sciences"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
