User&#8217;s sign up and create a profile, listing all the ways they can be reached (email, phone, twitter, Facebook, Skype, Msn messenger) plus info about themselves (first name, middle name, last name, home address, work address, date of birth, type of phone). The system assigns them a Unique ID called a CUE. The CUE is generally 4 characters but can be customized to more or less characters.  The system allows a sharing level to be associated with each piece of info they upload to the profile so that they can control how much information can be shown to each person. If a user updates or changes his/her contact info the people who are in his UpSling address book automatically get the latest version.  The user is only in charge of maintaining their info, they will only have to exchange CUEs, the system would handle the details of entering the details. Built in along with the best contact info management system on the web we also offer a stealth messenger called Whisper. Messages sent/received auto delete after 24 hours. Users can also manually delete any message sent/received at any time. To stand apart from the current practices on the web, UpSling does not and will not own any of the info it&#8217;s users upload.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/5572/145572v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0014/5572/145572v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0014/5572/145572v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ase","last_name":"Deliri","permalink":"ase-deliri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/4377/134377v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/4377/134377v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0013/4377/134377v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder/C.C.O","person":{"first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"Veres","permalink":"marcus-veres","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Kim","permalink":"ryan-kim-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Plaxo","permalink":"plaxo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0000/3880/3880v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/3880/3880v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,141],"assets/images/resized/0000/3880/3880v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0014/5571/145571v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,207],"assets/images/resized/0014/5571/145571v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,373],"assets/images/resized/0014/5571/145571v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0016/4991/164991v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,153],"assets/images/resized/0016/4991/164991v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,275],"assets/images/resized/0016/4991/164991v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bit.ly/prRFuP","title":"Techmento Article"}]}
