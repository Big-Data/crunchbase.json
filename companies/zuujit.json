Zuujit’s goal is to make it easy to buy, sell, share, and ship items online.</p>\n\n<p>Free listings, safe payments, and an integrated system that makes shipping easy are all designed with at ease of use and time conservation in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Zuujit merges the power of social networking with the advantages of e-commerce. The “Zuujit Social Marketplace” gives users the ability to price, buy, sell, share, and ship items using any web-enabled device. Zuujit doesn’t charge discouraging fees or promote third party advertising on the site. Sellers only pay a 2.8% credit card processing fee, and buyers receive from 10% to 33% off retail shipping rates.</p>\n\n<p>The company also offers cutting-edge fundraising software for charities, and has already attracted high-profile organizations such as Food Bank, Boy Scouts of America, YMCA, Habitat For Humanity, UnityShoppe, and the Not For Sale Campaign. The unique system gives these charities the ability to ask their supporters to donate items using Zuujit’s system. Zuujit processes the transactions and distributes funds from donated goods to the charity. Unlike any other competing programs, charities keep a minimum of 97% of the proceeds.</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/5554/75554v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[116,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/5554/75554v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[116,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/5554/75554v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.zuujit.com/about","source_description":"Capitalization of Zuujit","raised_amount":2700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":30,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"203 Chapala Street","address2":"Suite C","zip_code":"93101","city":"Santa Barbara","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
