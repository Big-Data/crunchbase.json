(PBI), a life sciences company, engages in the research, development, and commercialization of sample preparation system. It focuses on the development of a platform technology, called pressure cycling technology (PCT) that uses cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels to control bio-molecular interactions. The company offers Barocycler instrument and an internally developed disposable PULSE (Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction) Tubes, which together make up the PCT sample preparation system. It holds 13 U.S. and 5 foreign patents covering multiple applications of PCT in the life sciences field. PCT has applications in a various life sciences areas, including sample preparation for genomic, proteomic, and small molecule studies; control of chemical (enzymatic) reactions; protein purification; pathogen inactivation; immunodiagnostics; DNA sequencing; and food safety. PBIâ€™s customers include academic laboratories, government agencies, and biotechnology companies. The company was founded in 1978. It was formerly known as Boston Biomedica, Inc. and changed its name to Pressure BioSciences, Inc. in 2004. Pressure BioSciences is based in South Easton, Massachusetts. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0006/6921/66921v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[181,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/6921/66921v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[181,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/6921/66921v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"T.
