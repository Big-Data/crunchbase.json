Many people can&#8217;t send personal email from work, or work email from home. As soon as you move your laptop, you have trouble.</p>\n\n<p>Browser-based mail is OK if you have one account, but who do you know with only one email address?</p>\n\n<p>Some email providers control your From: address</p>\n\n<p>Instead of your mail appearing to come From: your normal address, it is shown as coming from your email supplier or from your email supplier â€œon behalf ofâ€ your normal address. That can be confusing to the recipient, can drop your mail into spam filters, and certainly looks unprofessional.</p>\n\n<p>Loa PowerTools lets you use your REAL From: address.</p>\n\n<p>Email with Loa Powertools.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to use your own email address, if you have more than one mail account, if you want to keep all your sent and received mail together, or if you are concerned about security, LoaPowerTools makes your life much easier.
