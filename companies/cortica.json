The essence of Cortica&#8217;s Image2Text™ technology lies in its ability to automatically extract the core concepts in images and video, and map these concepts to key-words and textual taxonomies.</p>\n\n<p>By virtue of their ability to simulate the appearance of the physical world, pictures drive interest, sentiment and commercial intent. Cortica&#8217;s product reads and automatically associates images with relevant ads. This groundbreaking model gives publishers a completely new monetization stream and provides brands and marketers the opportunity to reach highly targeted mass audiences.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0019/4155/194155v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0019/4155/194155v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,119],"assets/images/resized/0019/4155/194155v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/cortica-li-ka-shing/","source_description":"In-Image Ad Startup Cortica Raises $7M From Li Ka-Shing’s Horizons Ventures And Ynon Kreiz","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Horizons Ventures ","permalink":"horizons-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Ynon","last_name":"Kreiz","permalink":"ynon-kreiz","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Tel Aviv Office","address1":"Moshe Aviv Tower ","address2":"Jabotinsky 7, 43rd Floor","zip_code":"52520","city":"Ramat-Gan","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"R&D Center","address1":"3 HaYozma St.","address2":"Carmelim Bldg.","zip_code":"39032","city":"Tirat-Carmel","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"US Office","address1":"440 North Wolfe Rd","address2":"Suite WL151","zip_code":"94085","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0019/4722/194722v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,196],"assets/images/resized/0019/4722/194722v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,354],"assets/images/resized/0019/4722/194722v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/4723/194723v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/4723/194723v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/4723/194723v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
