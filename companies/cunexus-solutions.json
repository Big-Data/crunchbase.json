At the foundation of the company&#8217;s product and service offerings is Comprehensive Pre-Screened Lending (CPL) Strategy — an award-winning consumer lending strategy that has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce new loan acquisition costs, increase sales volume, and enhance customer experience and satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>CUneXus’ Comprehensive Pre-Screened Lending (CPL) strategies fuse automated risk assessment, pricing, direct marketing, retail sales support, delivery channel management, and point-of-sale acceptance and fulfillment. </p>\n\n<p>Released to the U.S. credit union market in late 2012, the company&#8217;s cplXpress product suite facilitates implementation of CPL marketing and sales strategy, and is the first of a series of software products aimed at re-engineering the port-crisis lender/consumer dynamic and making an immediate impact on the new, more rational and informed, way customers and institutions will interact in the financial sector of the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of the product suite is cplXpress - a rules engine and campaign dashboard that applies the patents-pending CPL processes that enable a lender to communicate their entire suite of loan products to customers 24/7/365. Recipients are presented personalized product sets and pricing on a preapproved basis (no loan application necessary), with the ability to accept loan offers and complete preapproved purchase transactions at a nearly on-demand basis.</p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s mission is to foster deeper customer relationships and re-establish lending institutions as trusted resources, while boosting convenience, efficiency, sales volume and ROI.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0022/0911/220911v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0022/0911/220911v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,239],"assets/images/resized/0022/0911/220911v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Darin","last_name":"Chong","permalink":"darin-chong","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Buerger","permalink":"dave-buerger","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Reich","permalink":"john-reich","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Richards, Rodriguez & Skeith LLP","permalink":"richards-rodriguez-skeith-llp","image":null}},{"title":"Intellectual Property","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Hemingway & Hansen LLP","permalink":"hemingway-hansen-llp","image":null}},{"title":"Sales & Distribution","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"PSB Integrated Marketing","permalink":"psb-integrated-marketing","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$510k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Private","permalink":"private","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Private","last_name":"Angel","permalink":"private-angel","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":35000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Friends","last_name":"and Family","permalink":"friends-and-family-2","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":65000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Private","permalink":"private","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":60000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Private","last_name":"Angels","permalink":"private-angels","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Santa Rosa","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0022/1522/221522v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0022/1522/221522v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,308],"assets/images/resized/0022/1522/221522v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0022/1523/221523v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0022/1523/221523v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0022/1523/221523v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
