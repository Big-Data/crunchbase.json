Lantos&#8217; novel 3D imaging technology provides fast, accurate and minimally invasive mapping of the human ear canal, enabling the development of comfortable, custom fit audio devices such as hearing aids, earphones and noise-canceling devices. Discovered and developed in the lab of MIT professor Douglas Hart, the ERLIF (Emission Re-absorption Laser Induced Florence) technology is a unique way of capturing 3D, and the intra-aural scanner will be its first application in the medical imaging field. The method eliminates the uncertainties associated with manual fits and offers a precise custom fit to the ear canal&#8217;s dimensions, bringing a natural fit experience to custom-made ear products. The company plans to jointly develop products and services based on its 3D imaging platform.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0014/9563/149563v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0014/9563/149563v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,76],"assets/images/resized/0014/9563/149563v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"C.
