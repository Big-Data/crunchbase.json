We are more than just a platform that allows individuals to easily share items they want to sell across all connected social networks. We turn your friends and followers into affiliates, providing incentive for them to share by allowing a user to offer a &#8220;refurrl&#8221; fee. If a share by one of your fiends leads to a sale, they earn cash via the &#8220;refurrl&#8221; fee. </p>\n\n<p>Your friends and followers tend to have similar interests and taste as you, it stands to reason that they would be interested in the items you have for sale (iPads, Phones, Clothes, etc). People need to sell items all the time when they need to move, want to upgrade or realize they didn&#8217;t need it in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Zack Hill, currently titled as CEO of Refurrl and Product manager. </p>\n\n<p>Alex Chalupka Lead developer</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Peoples PHP developer, and network admin.</p>\n\n<p>Gabe Couch Design, UX/UI</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,145],"assets/images/resized/0021/2780/212780v2-max-150x150.png"],[[199,193],"assets/images/resized/0021/2780/212780v2-max-250x250.png"],[[199,193],"assets/images/resized/0021/2780/212780v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Zack","last_name":"Hill","permalink":"zack-hill","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Developer ","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Chalupka","permalink":"alex-chalupka","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Design, UX/UI","person":{"first_name":"Gabe","last_name":"Couch","permalink":"gabe-couch","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"PHP developer, and network admin","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Peoples","permalink":"jonathan-peoples","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
