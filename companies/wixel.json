Essentially, Wixel serves as a springboard for creating beautiful and robust products. Initial projects include Mooblr.com and Boxrockit.com both due for release in 2011. Experimental projects include a social commerce solution, mobile commerce platform, s-commerce app and an ad exchange dedicated to online stores.</p>\n\n<p>Although the company primarily invests in creating and fueling new ideas, the studio does help select clients make their ideas a reality through consultation and development of web and mobile e-commerce applications. </p>\n\n<p>The company has a strong culture of play, creativity and innovation. Much of Wixelâ€™s experimental work is released as Open Source.</p>\n\n<p>Wixel was established in 2010. It is self funded and has been profitable since its inception.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,99],"assets/images/resized/0015/7651/157651v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[119,99],"assets/images/resized/0015/7651/157651v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[119,99],"assets/images/resized/0015/7651/157651v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Nieuwoudt","permalink":"sean-nieuwoudt","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/0543/160543v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/0543/160543v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,300],"assets/images/resized/0016/0543/160543v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Beverley","last_name":"Merriman","permalink":"beverley-merriman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,137],"assets/images/resized/0016/0542/160542v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,137],"assets/images/resized/0016/0542/160542v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,137],"assets/images/resized/0016/0542/160542v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Launched Boxrockit.com","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":18,"source_url":"http://www.feedmyapp.com/p/a/boxrockit-a-simple-way-to-sell-your-digital-products-on-twitter/25305","source_text":null,"source_description":"A simple way to sell your digital products on Twitter","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Wixel","permalink":"wixel"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0016/0539/160539v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,174],"assets/images/resized/0016/0539/160539v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,314],"assets/images/resized/0016/0539/160539v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
