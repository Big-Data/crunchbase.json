It is the application that will define the third generation of Financial Analysis.</p>\n\n<p>As a software application, it is a global first of its kind, as it is the only application currently on the global market that calculates 100% accuratelly the &#8220;Profit &amp; Loss&#8221;. The reason that another application didn&#8217;t exist before it, is that the previously considered state-of-the-art methodology of NPV is so inaccurate that it is not fit as a base for software creation. If you try to find in wikipedia an article for &#8220;Investment Evaluation&#8221;, you will find that there is none. That is a first class clue to understand how inaccurate and problematic the previous state-of-the-art methodology in investment evaluation was.</p>\n\n<p>C2bii is useful in investment evaluation scenarios, cashflow forecasts, working capital calculations, annual budgets, sensitivity analysis, product price policy scenarios, Bank loan terms evaluation, and most importantly general &#8220;What if&#8221; scenarios. It is currently in Version 1.0</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/4780/34780v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0003/4780/34780v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,209],"assets/images/resized/0003/4780/34780v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"C2BII","permalink":"c2bii","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","person":{"first_name":"Charalampos","last_name":"Oikonomidis","permalink":"charalampos-oikonomidis","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HG","address1":"4 Parnonos St.","address2":"","zip_code":"15125","city":"Athens","state_code":null,"country_code":"GRC","latitude":38.0474497,"longitude":23.8091477}],"milestones":[{"description":"The USPTO issued a \"Notice of Allowance\" on June 20 of 2011 on the second C2BII Patent Application.
