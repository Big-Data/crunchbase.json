With its secure hypervisor technology, PrivateCore enables the private execution of virtual machines and prevents service provider staff from accessing data while in-use. With PrivateCore, only the real owner of a virtual machine can access the data in-use and only with the right credentials. This protection helps businesses reduce the need for physical safeguards such as guards, server cages, closed-circuit TV, biometrics, man traps, identity management systems and many other structural and infrastructure security elements. PrivateCore was founded in Menlo Park, Calif., in 2011 by security veterans from VMware and Google and is funded by Foundation Capital.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0019/4288/194288v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0019/4288/194288v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0019/4288/194288v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Oded","last_name":"Horovitz","permalink":"oded-horovitz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Weis","permalink":"stephen-weis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Carl","last_name":"Waldspurger","permalink":"carl-waldspurger","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.25M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/privatecore/seed-funding/prweb9563822.htm","source_description":"PrivateCore Secures $2.25 Million in Seed Funding Led by Foundation Capital ","raised_amount":2250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Foundation Capital","permalink":"foundation-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[59,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/0986/10986v3-max-150x150.png"],[[59,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/0986/10986v3-max-250x250.png"],[[59,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/0986/10986v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
