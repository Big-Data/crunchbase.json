Content is first published to a location and then it can be discovered by users nearby. If the content is good, users can choose to be &#8220;infected&#8221; (which is similar to &#8220;fav&#8221; or &#8220;like&#8221; in traditional sense) and be a &#8220;carrier&#8221;. The dynamics of user movements will help spread the contents to more locations and thus be more discoverable by more users. When a user browse contents on Infactio.us, our backend system will rank contents based on their &#8220;infactiousness&#8221; scores which consist of a number of factors such as the location of the user.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0014/3037/143037v2-max-150x150.png"],[[209,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/3037/143037v2-max-250x250.png"],[[209,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/3037/143037v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Shek","last_name":"Ho","permalink":"shek-ho-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Loyd","last_name":"Zhao","permalink":"loyd-zhao","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Shek","last_name":"Ho","permalink":"shek-ho","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Digg","permalink":"digg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,158],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Flipboard","permalink":"flipboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-150x150.png"],[[198,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-250x250.png"],[[300,377],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Reddit","permalink":"reddit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0015/3639/153639v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0015/3639/153639v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,317],"assets/images/resized/0015/3639/153639v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/3640/153640v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/3640/153640v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/3640/153640v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
