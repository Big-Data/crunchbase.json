Based on a long history of collaboration and their shared educational missions, the founders are creating a new distance-learning experience. Anant Agarwal, former Director of MIT&#8217;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, serves as the first president of edX. Along with offering online courses, the institutions will use edX to research how students learn and how technology can transform learningâ€”both on-campus and worldwide. EdX is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and is governed by MIT and Harvard.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,84],"assets/images/resized/0020/2980/202980v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,84],"assets/images/resized/0020/2980/202980v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,84],"assets/images/resized/0020/2980/202980v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"Piotr","last_name":"Mitros","permalink":"piotr-mitros","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Sheehan","permalink":"jim-sheehan-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Content Development","person":{"first_name":"Howard","last_name":"Lurie","permalink":"howard-lurie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Rubin","permalink":"rob-rubin-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Anant","last_name":"Agarwal","permalink":"anant-agarwal","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Marketing Operations","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Malloy","permalink":"matt-malloy","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs","person":{"first_name":"Tena","last_name":"Herlihy","permalink":"tena-herlihy","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"edX.org","address1":"11 Cambridge Center","address2":"","zip_code":"02142","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"250\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/C2OQ51tu7W4?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>EdX: The Future of Online Education is Now </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0020/2840/202840v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0020/2840/202840v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0020/2840/202840v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/4266/204266v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/4266/204266v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[376,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/4266/204266v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/education/edlife/anant-agarwal-discusses-free-online-courses-offered-by-a-harvard-mit-partnership.html?_r=1","title":"Q & A with Anant Agarwal"},{"external_url":"http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2012/07/14/anant-agarwal-believes-online-education-from-mit-and-harvard-should-available-all/Af0kX44dPqpBKRV2IOSjPP/story.html","title":"Anant Agarwal believes an online education from MIT and Harvard should be available to all"},{"external_url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/06/20/harvard-and-mit-create-edx-free-university-courses_n_1612143.html?utm_hp_ref=uk","title":"Harvard And MIT Create EdX To Offer Free University Courses To The World (VIDEO) "},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=all","title":"The Year of the MOOC"}]}
