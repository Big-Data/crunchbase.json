Xfire also allows players to capture and share in-game media like videos, screen shots and live game broadcasts.  It works regardless of game type, server browser, or gaming service that a player is using.  Xfire eliminates the hassles of running multiple programs like IRC, instant messengers, Skype, or in-game friend lists to keep track of when and where a gamer&#8217;s friends are playing.  Over $40 million has been invested in Xfireâ€™s technology and the company has over 19 million users.  Xfire is headquartered in Santa Monica California. You can download the Xfire app from
