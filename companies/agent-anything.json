Clients can offer a specific Reward for their Mission (e.g. $10), or they can choose to accept offers from Agents. Either way, the Client fully controls the price they ultimately pay. Moreover, Clients are only charged AFTER the Mission is completed to their satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>Only college students can run Missions. Not only does this allow us to easily identify Agents and hold them accountable for the Missions they accept, but with college employment levels at record lows, students need all the work they can get. After verifying their identity via a university ID, Agents can choose from physical (have to go somewhere) and virtual (can be done from a computer) Missions. Even with just a couple of hours between classes, an Agent who plans out a few Missions effectively can make really good money.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0010/0636/100636v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,111],"assets/images/resized/0010/0636/100636v2-max-250x250.png"],[[339,151],"assets/images/resized/0010/0636/100636v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technical Officer","person":{"first_name":"Oliver","last_name":"Green","permalink":"oliver-green","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Schiff","permalink":"harry-schiff","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Montreal","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
