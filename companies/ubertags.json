UberTags built a container tag solution that makes it dead-easy to manage website tagging. Site managers simply paste their UberTag across their site(s) and then deploy all other tagging right from a browser. So, for example, you can deploy conversion tags on your thank-you pages, live chat on your support site, A/B testing on your landing pages, and analytics and retargeting across every page of your site via a browser in just a few minutes. </p>\n\n<p>Key benefits: \n&gt; Sites load faster! The core page loads then tags stream asynchronously.\n&gt; Launch a tag in minutes instead of waiting for IT.\n&gt; Centrally see your tags. See where a tag is loading and see which tags are loading on a particular page.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0011/6908/116908v2-max-150x150.png"],[[210,76],"assets/images/resized/0011/6908/116908v2-max-250x250.png"],[[210,76],"assets/images/resized/0011/6908/116908v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
