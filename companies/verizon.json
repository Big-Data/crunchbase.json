that Dick Lynch, EVP and CTO of Verizon, a leading telecommunications operator in the U.S., has been appointed to the GSMA's Board. Lynch's appointment follows Verizon gaining full membership to the GSMA as a result of its commitment to deploy commercial services based on Long-Term Evolution (LTE), the next-generation technology for Mobile Broadband and part of the GSM family of technologies, in 2010.\r\n\r\n\"We are delighted to welcome Dick and Verizon to the GSMA Board,\" said Rob Conway, CEO and Member of the Board of the GSMA. \"A leader in the worldwide mobile communications industry through its delivery of innovative new services and as an early adopter of advanced technologies such as LTE, Verizon brings additional depth and experience to the GSMA Board. Dick's expertise and leadership will be a tremendous asset as we work to identify and capitalise on new opportunities for our industry.\"\r\n\r\nLynch, who has nearly 40 years experience in the mobile communications industry, said: \"It is an honour to serve on the GSMA board. I expect that our new relationships with the broad global family of wireless companies will bring benefits to the American marketplace. This collaboration and outreach is significant as we build a full ecosystem around LTE, bringing together partners to build and grow our network, design new products, and put together the incredible new services that will make our lives better.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Lynch's leadership, Verizon Wireless* is on track to deploy LTE commercially in 25 to 30 markets across the US this year. The number of markets is expected to double within 15 months of the initial launch, and by the end of 2013, Verizon's entire 3G footprint, covering 285 million Americans, is expected to be covered by the next-generation Mobile Broadband technology. Verizon Wireless is simultaneously working with other companies serving less-populated areas to bring the benefits of a coordinated LTE service to rural Americans
