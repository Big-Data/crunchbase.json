It&#8217;s exclusively for Twitter users. Here&#8217;s how it works :</p>\n\n<p>1.. Sign on to http://twtmycard.com using your Twitter credentials (we use OAuth). </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Submit your profile information or upload a vCard, which we will parse for you. You can set your profile to be public or private. If your profile is set to be private, your profile can only be seen by people you have explicitly sent your card to. </li>\n<li>Follow @twtmycard (the â€˜botâ€™ will automatically follow you back). </li>\n<li>When you meet someone who you want to share your profile information with ask them for their twitter handle and send a direct message to @twtmycard with their handle. For example: &#8216;d twtmycard anandiyer&#8217;. The recipient (anandiyer in this case) will be sent a link to your profile on twtmycard.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0005/9446/59446v2-max-150x150.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0005/9446/59446v2-max-250x250.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0005/9446/59446v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, \"Ideator\"","person":{"first_name":"Anand","last_name":"Iyer","permalink":"anand-iyer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6062/46062v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6062/46062v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[258,357],"assets/images/resized/0004/6062/46062v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.facebook.com/pages/ANAND-IYER/86180082038</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
