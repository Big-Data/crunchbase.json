Our company was founded in 2006 by Jeff Han, who publicly demonstrated the companyâ€™s innovative multi-touch technology that year at the TED conference. Since then, our company has become a recognized brand for product innovation, a commitment to excellence and thought-leadership in the field.  We shipped our first multi-touch workstation and large wall solutions in 2007 and gained widespread recognition for transforming the way CNN covered the historic 2008 US Presidential elections.  In 2009, the Smithsonian awarded Perceptive Pixel the National Design Award in the inaugural category of Interaction Design.</p>\n\n<p>We help knowledge workers achieve better results with technology products that support intuitive, powerful and visually rich interface techniques. We help businesses become more productive with their existing computing solutions by making it easier for employees to collaborate and present their ideas. We help government organizations sort through the complexity of enormous amounts of data to make better decisions, faster and with unmatched precision. We draw on a rich and unique history of academic research and leadership in designing, developing and delivering products that benefit our diverse customers.</p>\n\n<p>While we were recognized early on for our large â€œwallâ€ solution featured in broadcasts by CNN and other broadcast customers, our customers and commercial partners rely on our expertise in hardware design, software development, professional services and customer support to help solve challenges in a variety of environments.  Our patent-pending technologies and products are used in broadcast, defense, geo-intelligence, energy exploration, industrial design and medical imaging.  We also produce many innovative and complementary accessories for our line of multi-touch products.   </p>\n\n<p>Beyond our product lines, we foster an ecosystem of developers that share our strong commitment to innovation and willingness to push the boundaries of user interface solutions.  Our partners use our software development kit to drive the next generation of touch-enabled applications.  We share our experience and collaborate with our partners to help them enhance their products and drive high quality and performance standards throughout the touch industry.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Perceptive Pixel is a privately held company with headquarters in New York City and offices in Palo Alto, Portland, and Washington D.C. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,16],"assets/images/resized/0010/6890/106890v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/6890/106890v1-max-250x250.png"],[[274,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/6890/106890v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder/ Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"Jefferson","last_name":"Han","permalink":"jefferson-han","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Corporate Development and General Counsel","person":{"first_name":"Derrick","last_name":"Horner","permalink":"derrick-horner","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Sales","person":{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"Allman","permalink":"fred-allman","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Hardware Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Slobodin","permalink":"david-slobodin","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Software Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Triantos","permalink":"nick-triantos-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Professional Solutions and Services","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Pette","permalink":"bob-pette","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-bought-a-developer-of-gargantuan-tablets-2012-7","source_description":"Microsoft Buys Perceptive Pixel, A Developer Of Gargantuan Tablets","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":9,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"102 Madison Ave.","address2":"12th Floor","zip_code":"10016","city":"New York","state_code":"WI","country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Won 2009 National Design Award from Cooper Hewitt Museum, the Design Branch of the Smithsonian Institution.","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Perceptive Pixel","permalink":"perceptive-pixel"}},{"description":"Jeff Han named one of the Worldâ€™s 100 Most Influential People by Time Magazine in 2008.","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Perceptive Pixel","permalink":"perceptive-pixel"}},{"description":"CNN reporters John King and Wolf Blitzer, using Perceptive Pixelâ€™s Multi-Touch Wall and ElectionWatch software as a fundamental part of their coverage of the 2008 election season, for which CNN received the prestigious Peabody Award.","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Perceptive Pixel","permalink":"perceptive-pixel"}},{"description":"3M Invests in Perceptive Pixel Inc.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":21,"source_url":"http://www.perceptivepixel.com/press_release_2.html","source_text":"","source_description":"3M Invests in Perceptive Pixel Inc.","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Perceptive Pixel","permalink":"perceptive-pixel"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
