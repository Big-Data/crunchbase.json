Not freemium, or free with usage caps. Just plain free. </p>\n\n<p>2) Wave is a full double-entry accounting app, which is preferred by accountants. It also has financial dashboards, and can track expenses, and can be used in a lightweight manner if business owners don&#8217;t need or want full accounting reporting. Wave offers invoicing tools, and a full suite of reports, as well as journal transactions.</p>\n\n<p>3) Wave imports data from your bank accounts, credit cards, etc., to eliminate manual entry and accounting grunt work. There are no limits on the number of transactions. This is included in the free service. </p>\n\n<p>4) Wave is unique in that it allows you to track business and personal finances together. If you ever pay for a business expense on a personal credit card, or vice versa, and need proper accounting for this, you&#8217;ll understand the value of this feature. </p>\n\n<p>5) Wave allows you to track multiple businesses within your account. </p>\n\n<p>6) Wave permits unlimited guest collaborators.</p>\n\n<p>Some other applications offer some of these features, but this combination, and especially at this price, is unique. </p>\n\n<p>Wave launched its FreshBooks integration in January 2010. Additional product offerings will include advanced import/export functionality (early 2011).</p>\n\n<p>Wave&#8217;s business model is to act as a purchasing department or procurement office for small businesses. We&#8217;ll find discounted or advantageous pricing on products and services that matter, and present them to small businesses. Wave will be paid by the provider. In this way, we continue to offer Wave for free. </p>\n\n<p>Personally identifiable information, and an individual business&#8217;s financial details, are treated with top security and never shared with a supplier.</p>\n\n<p>Wave is an international accounting tool, and can be customized for virtually any region and any currency. Wave Accounting launched its free online accounting program for small businesses in November 2010. Weâ€™re currently signing up tens of thousands of new small business customers per month, and have users in more than 200 countries. Since launch, Wave has secured more than $19 million in funding.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,29],"assets/images/resized/0011/5241/115241v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,29],"assets/images/resized/0011/5241/115241v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,29],"assets/images/resized/0011/5241/115241v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kirk","last_name":"Simpson","permalink":"kirk-simpson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Lochrie","permalink":"james-lochrie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice
