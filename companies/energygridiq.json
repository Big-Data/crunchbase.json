EIQ displays projects on a map interface and uses geo-coded databases to suggest incentives, rebates and credits that are available for ongoing projects. EIQ&#8217;s platform gives service providers, retailers, governments, agencies and private financiers enhanced visibility and analytics on projects, motivating them to offer surgical resources and deals to make projects more attractive; thereby substantially reducing costs and increasing returns for commercial energy managers and residential homeowners.</p>\n\n<p>EIQ&#8217;s goal is to capture all of the world&#8217;s energy thoughts irrespective of their size or scope using geo-data. Project developers and users anywhere in the world can create and showcase an energy project or an idea that might turn into a project for home, office or the entire community. The project could be to light a home, light a village, put solar on a commercial building, setup a wind turbine on a farm, buy an appliance or something as simple as replace an old refrigerator.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0017/6559/176559v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0017/6559/176559v2-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0017/6559/176559v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1650 Broadway","address2":"","zip_code":"10019","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
