Digital fabricators and materials suppliers can win and manage pre-paid jobs online. DIYers and buyers can submit requests to get things made for them, and click to make designs from the creative community.</p>\n\n<p>With thousands of user-generated products made each month, their vision is to reinvent how goods are designed, made and distributed worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>The core of this vision is the trade in product designs â€“ a natural extension of the trade in music (iTunes), photos (Flickr), movies (YouTube) and apps (iPhone).</p>\n\n<p>Using their digital making system these product designs can be priced instantly online and made locally, as close to the point of consumption as possible.</p>\n\n<p>This means goods are made in the greenest way â€¦ making on demand reduces warehousing and wastage, and making locally emphasizes digital transportation of product designs rather than the traditional shipping of physical products.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0000/0697/697v1-max-150x150.png"],[[189,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/0697/697v1-max-250x250.png"],[[189,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/0697/697v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Designmake","permalink":"ponoko","image":null},{"name":"Ponoko ID","permalink":"ponoko-id","image":null},{"name":"Ponoko Marketplace","permalink":"ponoko-marketplace","image":null},{"name":"Digitalmake","permalink":"the-ponoko-platform","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"ten Have","permalink":"david-ten-have","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Chief Strategy Officer","person":{"first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Elley","permalink":"derek-elley","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","person":{"first_name":"Graham","last_name":"Hill","permalink":"graham-hill","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Designer Relations","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Emery","permalink":"dan-emery","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","person":{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"Durham","permalink":"fred-durham","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Community Manager","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Judkins","permalink":"josh-judkins","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Community Manager","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Lewis","permalink":"john-lewis","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"US Office","address1":"3431 Louise Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94608","city":"Oakland","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.8136086,"longitude":-122.2966496},{"description":"NZ Office","address1":"27 Dixon Street","address2":"Level 1","zip_code":"6011","city":"Wellington","state_code":null,"country_code":"NZL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/8598/38598v2-max-150x150.png"],[[171,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/8598/38598v2-max-250x250.png"],[[309,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/8598/38598v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0003/8600/38600v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,213],"assets/images/resized/0003/8600/38600v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,384],"assets/images/resized/0003/8600/38600v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
