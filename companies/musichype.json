MusicHype automatically IDs an artist&#8217;s top fans, allowing them to focus their efforts where it counts.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment artists, management companies &amp; labels have a big problem. These companies sift through big data reports, studies &amp; stats but can&#8217;t take action. They struggle to communicate directly with their fans across every social platform. They know that 10% of their fan base makes up 46% of total revenue, so they really need to focus. But they can&#8217;t monetize that 10% because they don&#8217;t know who these fans are.</p>\n\n<p>MusicHype&#8217;s solution is to make social data actionable, offering a real-time feed of personal fan data in a centralized hub that identifies the top 10% of fans. MusicHype shows a complete picture of fan data: geography, social platforms, activity &amp; more. Our console allows customers to communicate &amp; build direct-to-fan relationships, while built-in intelligence identifies &amp; recommends marketing actions.</p>\n\n<p>MusicHype&#8217;s solution is powered by a proprietary social intelligence engine to track private fan behavior across every major social network &amp; service. This real-time feed highlights a fan&#8217;s interest right now, so customers can target those fans most receptive to marketing messages. Customers see a real-time buzz feed of active social networks and determine where to focus their efforts to get best ROI.</p>\n\n<p>MusicHype generates revenue from monthly service fees, based on the # of fans per artist and support service level.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/6798/196798v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/6798/196798v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/6798/196798v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Moskovitz","permalink":"dave-moskovitz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO,
