Our natural language processing software parses patient text responses, and our adaptive learning algorithm constructs a unique risk profile for every patient.  The more we learn, the more targeted and precise our questions will be, but for the patient this feels like a natural, ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n<p>We anticipate and detect side effects and complications, then alert the patient and doctor when we something is wrong.  We do not give the doctor a diagnosis, but provide him or her with a concise patient report. This enables a more efficient, informed and truly personalized visit.  Target customers for this service include health care providers and pharmacies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0020/6606/206606v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,130],"assets/images/resized/0020/6606/206606v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,234],"assets/images/resized/0020/6606/206606v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"Winn","permalink":"julia-winn","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/2396/212396v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/2396/212396v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/2396/212396v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://my.betterfit.com/contact</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Zagorsky","permalink":"benjamin-zagorsky","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Product Designer","person":{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"Pierre","permalink":"ingrid-pierre","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$133k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2012/08/techstars_boston_announces_sta.html","source_description":"TechStars Boston announces startups accepted into its fall 2012 class","raised_amount":118000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":23,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"TechStars","permalink":"techstars","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-150x150.png"],[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-250x250.png"],[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/06/06/meet-the-new-batch-of-summerhighland-student-startups/","source_description":"Summer@Highland Accepts Latest Batch Of Student Startups","raised_amount":15000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Highland Capital Partners","permalink":"highland-capital-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/0992/10992v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,67],"assets/images/resized/0001/0992/10992v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,67],"assets/images/resized/0001/0992/10992v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,109],"assets/images/resized/0020/8249/208249v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,182],"assets/images/resized/0020/8249/208249v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,292],"assets/images/resized/0020/8249/208249v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
