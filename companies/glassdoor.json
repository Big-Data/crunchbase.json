Job seekers can also take advantage of Glassdoor&#8217;s Inside Connections tool, allowing them to leverage their Facebook friends network to uncover &#8216;ins&#8217; at companies to help get their resume noticed or give personal advice.</p>\n\n<p>Glassdoor, founded in 2007 with a public beta version launched in June 2008, has since offered job interview questions and reviews, office photos, career advice as well as enhanced employer profiles. In 2010, Glassdoor launched JobScope, a search technology that helps job seekers more effectively browse job listings and preview what it is really like to work there by providing instant, in-depth details about companies directly from each listing. In 2012, Glassdoor launched Inside Connections to allow job seekers to discover who they already know at companies through their existing Facebook network.</p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Sausalito, Calif., Glassdoor was founded by Richard Barton, Robert Hohman and Tim Besse and has raised $42.2 million from its founders, Benchmark Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures, Battery Ventures and DAG Ventures.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0016/8622/168622v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/8622/168622v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/8622/168622v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Salary
