To do so, Gemzies aims to â€œstartâ€ at the point a Wikipedia-page â€œendsâ€. </p>\n\n<p>Gemzies-pages are focused on a single topic. On that topic, they provide a structured and community-rated list of suggested sites, videos, images, news and books. </p>\n\n<p>Gemzies-pages are created and maintained by fellow experts, who want to show their expertise to the rest of the world. Gemzies provides a â€˜virtual stageâ€™ for these experts, providing for expert ranking lists, expert search, and expert â€˜trackingâ€™.</p>\n\n<p>Gemzies thus adds Digg-type rating, and Delicious-type tagging, to serious content focused on any single topic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong>\nThere is no shortage of content on the internet. For every subject you can check thousands of websites, all giving you more or less the same info.</p>\n\n<p>At this moment there is no website easily allowing experts to collectively gather, review and tag all kinds of serious â€˜web favoritesâ€™ (sites, videos, images, books, news), on any possible subject, in a single, structured page. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The solution: Gemzies-pages</strong>\nGemzies-pages are focused on a single topic. They contain a structured overview of suggested relevant websites, videos, photos, books and news on that topic, all in just one view. </p>\n\n<p>Gemzies-pages are filled and maintained by fellow experts, die-hard fans, or anyone with a serious opinion, on anything from Al Gore to ZZ Top. Anyone can apply to start a new Gemzies page, providing a clear affinity with the subject, and providing the topic isnâ€™t commercial or explicit.</p>\n\n<p>Gemzies-pages need the passion, a bit of commitment, and the expertise of individuals who want to show their knowledge on Internet content to the rest of the world. By its very nature, Gemzies-pages will thus contain topics that people have a passion for, like sports, music artists, professions, science, hobbies, global issues, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike other initiatives, Gemzies does not pay a vast editorial staff to build the ultimate human powered link directory. Instead, Gemzies offers â€˜15 minutes of fameâ€™, highlighting both the authors, and the most valuable contributors, to a Gemzies page. </p>\n\n<p><strong>A virtual stage for experts</strong> \nOur contributors add and review entries, simply for the sake of helping others getting started. </p>\n\n<p>Experts who contribute to Gemzies-pages, are ranked on a â€˜virtual stageâ€™. Their contributions can be tracked, thus reflecting their expertise to the rest of the world. What comes from that is up to the experts themselves&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>Visitors can easily search for experts, and their individual contributions. Experts can be â€˜bookmarkedâ€™, informing visitors when new entries have been made by the expert, all depending on the privacy settings chosen by the experts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creating Gemzies pages</strong>\nPage creation is a simple process; it takes an average user 30 minutes to publish a first version of a Gemzies-page, containing at least 10 relevant entries (videos, sites, images and books on a single topic). Gemzies takes care of page structure, look &amp; feel, video display, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The creator of a Gemzies page is recognized as â€˜authorâ€™ of the page. After publication, the Gemzies-page is â€˜openâ€™ to the rest of the world, to add new entries and review existing entries. Fellow experts who contribute to the page, are automatically added in the experts ranking list. </p>\n\n<p>Gemzies provides tools to suggest relevant content for new entries, using APIs from Google (to suggest relevant websites and books), and Youtube (for videos).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a Gemzies page automatically displays the latest news on the specific topic (currently based on Google News).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content tagging and rating</strong>\nSimilar to e.g. Delicious, contributors can add tags to new entries for a Gemzies-page, or suggest additional tags to existing entries. These tags support other users to browse the Gemzies-page. The tags are also fed into a search engine (basic, for now), enabling visitors to search for relevant content across the entire Gemzies database.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to e.g. Digg, visitors can â€˜voteâ€™ on the suggested entries from others. Based on these votes, the most popular sites, videos, images and books will appear â€˜on topâ€™ of their category. Unlike Digg (and many of its clones), we allow our visitors to â€˜voteâ€™ for anything but news, since we consider news to have a much shorter-lived life span, when compared to sites, videos, etc. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Page quality</strong>\nGemzies fully understands it needs to grow towards a tipping point, in order to increase the relevancy of its content. </p>\n\n<p>To quickly judge the &#8220;quality&#8221; of a Gemzies page, it will be ranked with an overall quality indicator, ranging from 1 to 5 Gemzies. These Gemzies are earned based on a.o. the number of active contributors, and the average rating of entries by visitors and fellow experts. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0003/0671/30671v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/0671/30671v2-max-250x250.png"],[[375,96],"assets/images/resized/0003/0671/30671v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Dirk","last_name":"van der Heijden","permalink":"dirk-van-der-heijden","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Marcel","last_name":"van Brienen","permalink":"marcel-van-brienen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Kouwenhoven","permalink":"vincent-kouwenhoven","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Mahalo","permalink":"mahalo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4246/4246v6-max-150x150.png"],[[200,64],"assets/images/resized/0000/4246/4246v6-max-250x250.png"],[[200,64],"assets/images/resized/0000/4246/4246v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Fanpop","permalink":"fanpop","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/4437/14437v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/4437/14437v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[271,84],"assets/images/resized/0001/4437/14437v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Amsterdam Office","address1":"Anthony Fokkerweg 21","address2":"","zip_code":"1059 CN ","city":"Amsterdam","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":52.342938,"longitude":4.8419083}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/1593/31593v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0003/1593/31593v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0003/1593/31593v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[85,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/1594/31594v2-max-150x150.png"],[[142,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/1594/31594v2-max-250x250.png"],[[255,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/1594/31594v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
