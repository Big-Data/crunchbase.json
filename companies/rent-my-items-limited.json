It has been said that Collaborative Consumption is “a new socio-economic &#8216;big idea&#8217; promising a revolution in the way we consume”. There are proven success stories of similar businesses in the USA and Time Magazine has said that Collaborative Consumption is one of the top ten ideas that will change the world.</p>\n\n<p>In order to gain traction on the site listing items is free for the first six months following launch. Following this period RMI will charge Rentors a monthly listing fee of £1.00 per item, which will be collected by PayPal.  The principal objective of the business is therefore to develop a recurring monthly revenue stream based on the number of items listed. The company will not be involved in the actual rental process of each item, and this will be contracted directly between the owner and individual renting the item.</p>\n\n<p>The website launched on Monday 19th September with Warren Heal being interviewed on BBC Breakfast, BBC Radio 5 Live and 10 local BBC radio stations.</p>\n\n<p>RMI has been accepted onto the Enterprise Investment Scheme by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The scheme offers a range of tax reliefs to investors.</p>\n\n<p>The company is now seeking funding that will be used to further develop the website, including Wanted Items and Services sections, for the initial marketing campaign and PR and advertising. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0016/9514/169514v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,191],"assets/images/resized/0016/9514/169514v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,344],"assets/images/resized/0016/9514/169514v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Warren","last_name":"Heal","permalink":"warren-heal","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Savident","permalink":"paul-savident","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Interim CTO","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Tong","permalink":"nick-tong","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1029/171029v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1029/171029v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1029/171029v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Zilok","permalink":"zilok","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/3731/13731v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/3731/13731v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/3731/13731v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Ecomodo","permalink":"ecomodo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0011/3230/113230v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[199,49],"assets/images/resized/0011/3230/113230v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[199,49],"assets/images/resized/0011/3230/113230v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Web development ","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cobb Digital","permalink":"cobb-digital","image":null}},{"title":"PR & Marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Paul Savident","permalink":"paul-savident","image":null}},{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Davenport Lyons","permalink":"davenport-lyons","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"£25k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Friends","last_name":"and Family","permalink":"friends-and-family-2","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0016/9512/169512v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,230],"assets/images/resized/0016/9512/169512v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,415],"assets/images/resized/0016/9512/169512v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/9513/169513v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,206],"assets/images/resized/0016/9513/169513v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,371],"assets/images/resized/0016/9513/169513v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://i-rent.cc/vsXz5C","title":"10 Ways To Boost Your Finances in 2012"},{"external_url":"http://i-rent.cc/uCswpu","title":"Don't Dump Christmas Presents - Rent Them Out"},{"external_url":"http://i-rent.cc/rQwVpz","title":"Rent Little-Used Items & Make Some Money"},{"external_url":"http://i-rent.cc/qXABN1","title":"Monetize Home Items"},{"external_url":"http://i-rent.cc/nFujg3","title":"Is Renting Everyday Items The Futue?"}]}
