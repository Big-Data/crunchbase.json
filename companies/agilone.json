These tools could not handle data in disparate sources, which was an increasing problem as the number of new channels was growing.   Getting data out of these sytems was often complex and required an analyst to perform SQL qeueries.  Even if you could get the right data, acting on it was difficult as the reporting and campaign management tools were not integrated. Simply put - the path from marketing data to effective campaigns was convuluted and inefficient. They knew there had to be a better way, and out of their passion to find it, Agilone was born.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0014/8370/148370v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0014/8370/148370v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,142],"assets/images/resized/0014/8370/148370v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Omer","last_name":"Artun","permalink":"omer-artun","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Tracy","last_name":"Eiler","permalink":"tracy-eiler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Kiriakis","permalink":"bill-kiriakis-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Technology","person":{"first_name":"Jari","last_name":"Koister","permalink":"jari-koister","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Kiriakis","permalink":"bill-kiriakis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product","person":{"first_name":"Anselme","last_name":"Le Van","permalink":"anselme-le-van","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Calega","permalink":"gary-calega","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$16M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"hhttp://www.pehub.com/174706/agilone-closes-10m-series-b-2/","source_description":"AgilOne Closes $10M Series B","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sequoia Capital","permalink":"sequoia-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/28/agileone-raises-10m-from-mayfield-and-greylock-to-help-marketers-tap-into-big-data/","source_description":"AgilOne Raises $10M From Mayfield And Sequoia To Help Marketers Tap Into Big Data","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":28,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mayfield Fund","permalink":"mayfield-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/0850/850v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/0850/850v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[217,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/0850/850v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sequoia Capital","permalink":"sequoia-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1091 N.
