Well what we do here is create wacky websites whenever we fancy it.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not like any other wanna-be media company making absolutely no money at all without even having fun wasting time on their stupid applications. Nikomi is here for the lulz.</p>\n\n<p>Our services are somewhat&#8230; unique. And with quoting Bill Gates you can interoperate our business model, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t make it good, at least make it look good&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Nikomi was founded in February 2012 as an internet portal carrying viral videos, popular memes and shortened news stories that the CEO Lewis Brookfield found interesting. We had no purpose back then, well&#8230; we still don&#8217;t but at least we have a nice homepage with jQuery effects now!</p>\n\n<p>If you want to work with us or get us to work for you then use our wonderful contact form on the you guessed it &#8216;contact&#8217; page.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2567/182567v4-max-150x150.png"],[[154,154],"assets/images/resized/0018/2567/182567v4-max-250x250.png"],[[154,154],"assets/images/resized/0018/2567/182567v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"Maher","permalink":"hugo-maher","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"MD, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Lewis","last_name":"Brookfield","permalink":"lewis-brookfield","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0009/4959/94959v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0009/4959/94959v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0009/4959/94959v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Picture of me</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Charlie","last_name":"Woodriff","permalink":"charlie-woodriff-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
