TC made a variety of branded <a href=\"/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> applications for companies like <a href=\"/company/bestbuy\" title=\"Best Buy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"/company/sprint-nextel\" title=\"Sprint\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprint</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/comcast\" title=\"Comcast\">Comcast</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After the release of the <a href=\"/product/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\" rel=\"nofollow\">iPhone</a> and subsequent availability of the iPhone SDK, TC saw the opportunity to create branded mobile applications for educational institutions. Their first venture into the mobile space was the creation of iStanford (in October 2008), an iPhone app that integrates a variety of services used by Stanford students and faculty. iStanford allowed users to search the campus directory and campus map, view athletics and course information, and a variety of other campus services. Terribyclever quickly productized their offering, under the name MobilEdu (http://www.medu.com) and began selling the service (as a subscription) to other institutions. In 8 months, MobilEdu was in use by almost a dozen higher-ed institutions such as Duke University, Texas A&amp;M, UC San Diego, and University of Washington.</p>\n\n<p>In July of 2009, <a href=\"/company/blackboard\" title=\"Blackboard Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackboard Inc.</a> acquired Terriblyclever for $4mil, at which time TC had 5 full time employees, most of whom were close friends and current students at Stanford University. Today, TC now runs the Mobile division of Blackboard, a public company based in Washington, D.C.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President / Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Bernstein","permalink":"joseph-bernstein","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Kayvon","last_name":"Beykpour","permalink":"kayvon-beykpour","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/0253/60253v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/0253/60253v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,332],"assets/images/resized/0006/0253/60253v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Lead Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Cunningham","permalink":"benjamin-cunningham","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":4000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://bbworld.wordpress.com/","source_description":"BbWorld09 â€“ Blackboard Corporate Keynote","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":14,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Blackboard","permalink":"blackboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/2581/22581v1-max-150x150.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/2581/22581v1-max-250x250.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/2581/22581v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"San Francisco","address1":"55 Hawthorne Lane, #470","address2":"","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Blackboard-Buys-Student-Run/7268","title":"Blackboard acquires Terriblyclever"},{"external_url":"http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1869169,00.html","title":"TIM: Can iStanford take on Facebook mobile?"}]}
