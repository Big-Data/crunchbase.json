They bring Jon Scieszka, Rosemary Wells, Andrew Clements, Patricia MacLachlan, Alan Katz, David Carter, Kevin Lewis, Mike Austin, and Caitlin Friedman, among many other bestselling authors and illustrators, animators, celebrity performers and musicians together with talented editors and software developers to create a completely new form of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>When children open Ruckus apps, turning and tilting pages, touching words and art, they read, see, and enter a story. Words, pictures, music, and dynamics made possible only by touch screen technology are woven to tell original stories to entrance and expand their imaginations. As with their favorite picture books, children will be enriched by and return to Ruckus apps again and again.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0012/4834/124834v1-max-150x150.png"],[[182,164],"assets/images/resized/0012/4834/124834v1-max-250x250.png"],[[182,164],"assets/images/resized/0012/4834/124834v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Content Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Root","permalink":"jason-root-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Content Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Root","permalink":"jason-root-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Richesh","last_name":"Ruchir","permalink":"richesh-ruchir-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=11635627&bw=20110303006469","source_description":"Ruckus Media Group Secures Series A Funding to Ramp Up Mobile App Efforts and Cross Platform Publishing ","raised_amount":3500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":3,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Alsop Louie Partners","permalink":"alsop-louie-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0001/0797/10797v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/0797/10797v2-max-250x250.png"],[[391,85],"assets/images/resized/0001/0797/10797v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"372 Danbury Road","address2":"","zip_code":"06897","city":"Wilton","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0012/4837/124837v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0012/4837/124837v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0012/4837/124837v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
