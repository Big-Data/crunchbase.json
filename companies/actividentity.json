The company addresses three identity management market segments: Employer-to-Employee, Business-to-Customer, and Government-to-Citizen. ActivIdentityâ€™s Employer-to-Employee (E2E) solutions enable employers to provide highly secure access to data and applications for their employees, contractors, partners, and suppliers that are critical to enhance operational efficiency and strengthen corporate security and compliance. The companyâ€™s Business-to-Customer (B2C) solutions offer businesses highly secure online services for their customers that are necessary to reduce business security management costs and increase customers&#8217; trust and confidence when engaging in business transactions. ActivIdentityâ€™s Government-to-Citizen (G2C) solutions provide post-issuance update capabilities that are essential for government agencies when issuing smart card-based identities to citizens in the form of so-called ePassports, border crossing cards, eID cards, or driver&#8217;s licenses. Its experience is leveraged by security-minded organizations in large scale deployments, such as the U.S. Department of Defense. The companyâ€™s customers issued approximately 100 million credentials, securing the holderâ€™s digital identity. It markets and sells its products and technologies through a worldwide direct sales force and through a network of partners, including system integrators, original equipment manufacturers, value added distributors, and value added resellers. The company was founded in 1985 and is headquartered in Fremont, California.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0006/9698/69698v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/9698/69698v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/9698/69698v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Grant","last_name":"Evans","permalink":"grant-evans","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Jacques","last_name":"D.
