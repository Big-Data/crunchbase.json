You no longer have to freeze data in a document or presentation.  By using Swivel, data can be shared with friends who can then easily explore it themselves.  In a world where most news is pure spin and opinion, Swivel is trying to apply the power of the Web to dig up the facts.  By making it easy for people to explore data themselves, biased news sources no longer have to be relied on.</p>\n\n<p>Public accounts are free.
