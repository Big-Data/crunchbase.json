Ordering in and dining out go hand in hand so having to search across these multiple services and remember choices is a pain - especially for foodies &amp; value-hunters.</p>\n\n<p>YumYumNet helps these folks with an online search engine for restaurant food. The website allows users to search and discover delicious foods from thousands of restaurants that offer online ordering and dining out deals. Users can easily form collections of &#8220;Food Bookmarks&#8221; from their discoveries that can be searched, managed, and shared with friends. Each &#8220;Food Bookmark&#8221; lets the user order from that restaurant or set up their dining out experience by reserving a table and redeeming the promotion.</p>\n\n<p>We aggregate data from online restaurant ordering websites, dining deal services, and menu directories for holistic food visibility and management with one search. </p>\n\n<p>YumYumNet earns affiliate revenue from Seamless, GrubHub, and OpenTable </p>\n\n<p>The Company also plans on charging local restaurants to directly list dining out deals that will be promoted in search results.</p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Trope (Yoni) - Co-Founder &amp; Chief Executive Officer</p>\n\n<p>Pavan Malhotra (Niel a.k.a Coder Poet) - Co-Founder &amp; Chief Technology Officer</p>\n\n<p>Yoni and Niel have been NYU college buddies since 2008. Niel was Pre-Med at the time and Yoni was an Economics major scouring NYC for a finance internship at a time when finance was a bad word. Thankfully, Niel started reading essays by Paul Graham and made the switch to Computer Science. Yoni found himself spending an unhealthy amount of time reading TechCrunch and worked gigs in consulting and venture capital before making the full-time plunge to entrepreneurship. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Trope (Yoni)","permalink":"jonathan-trope-yoni","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Pavan","last_name":"Malhotra (Niel a.k.a Coder Poet)","permalink":"pavan-malhotra-niel-a-k-a-coder-poet","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
