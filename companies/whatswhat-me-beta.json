However, todayâ€™s popular adult social networks were not built for children and are inappropriate for kids under 13.  With this in mind, WhatsWhat.me (Beta) was created to be safe, secure and age-appropriate with highly sophisticated privacy and security measures in place, and in strict adherence to COPPA regulations.  And, the siteâ€™s mission is to â€œteach and protectâ€ children as they learn and practice positive online behavior in a â€œno bullying allowed,â€ â€œkids-onlyâ€ community.   Also, to help parents â€œget smartâ€ about kids and social networks, WhatsWhat.me (Beta) has the Parent Resource Center with â€œAsk The Expert,â€ a tech glossary, news and information re keeping kids safe online.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"F.
