And you give them to people so they remember and contact you. But did you know that people hate business cards? They were cool back when Gutenberg invented the printing press. But today people take them out of courtesy, loose them and can&#8217;t find them if they actually want to contact you later on. The only reason people still use them is that no one invented anything better yet.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why the guys at joox got together to turn the business card into something awesome.</p>\n\n<p>First they improved the quality using sustainable premium quality paper, offset quality print, velvety finishing and laser cutting. And they designed a super modern box to hold the cards. </p>\n\n<p>But that didn&#8217;t change that much. So they developed a system where you can import any images you have on you computer or anywhere on the internet and create unique cards for each one.</p>\n\n<p>But that still didn&#8217;t strike them as innovative enough. So they did this. They developed an app for your iPhone or Android. Are you ready to hear what the app does?\nYou download the joox cloud card app and hold your smart phone in front of any joox card. It will recognize every individual image and open the link that you defined for that image in your phone. For example a youtube video, your business&#8217; website , a favorite music, your online portfolio or even your voice!.</p>\n\n<p>Say goodbye to the old QR code. Now, you can update all information of your cards using different images and take them to the clouds! </p>\n\n<p>Also, you can see all audience and who, when, where and how the people saw your cards. </p>\n\n<p>Or Show different products of your online shop and send your customer directly to buy your t-shirt</p>\n\n<p>Let your fans to listen your brand new rap success!</p>\n\n<p>But really there are infinite possibilities of things you can do with Joox cards.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0020/9014/209014v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/9014/209014v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0020/9014/209014v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Genau","last_name":"Lopes Jr","permalink":"genau-lopes-jr","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CKO","person":{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Lima","permalink":"carlos-lima","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Law","person":{"first_name":"Helio","last_name":"Abreu","permalink":"helio-abreu","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"ConceptPR","permalink":"conceptpr","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$1.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":7,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Joox Office HQ","address1":"Rua Comendador Araujo, 510","address2":"","zip_code":"80420000","city":"Curitiba","state_code":null,"country_code":"BRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/35497080?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/35497080\">Joox Cards Spot</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/jooxcards\">Joox Cards</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Joox Spot Launch</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/9302/209302v2-max-150x150.png"],[[172,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/9302/209302v2-max-250x250.png"],[[310,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/9302/209302v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://idgnow.uol.com.br/internet/2012/07/13/startup-brasileira-promete-fim-dos-cartoes-de-visita-chatos/","title":"IDG"}]}
