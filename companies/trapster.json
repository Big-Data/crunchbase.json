Users report traps by pressing a button on your phone, or calling a toll free number. Other user&#8217;s phones will alert them as they approach the trap. Trapster learns the credibility of traps based on how many users agree. It also learns the credibility of each user, over time.\nTrapster combines technologies such as GPS and wireless location, voice transcription, geocoding, reverse geocoding, and SMS, with a central database server. It communicates in real time, using the Internet.\nTrapster supports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone</li>\n<li>BlackBerry</li>\n<li>Android (the TMobile G1 and others)</li>\n<li>Nokia N95, N96, N97, 5800, E71, and other Symbian s60 phones</li>\n<li>Unlocked J2ME phones with GPS (for example the TMobile Sony Ericsson W370)</li>\n<li>Palm Pre and Windows Mobile versions coming soon!\nIf you don&#8217;t have one of these phones you can still get text message alerts with maps on any phone that supports text messaging, and report traps that you see using our 1-800 tip line. </li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/1835/61835v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0006/1835/61835v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0006/1835/61835v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"McCarthy","permalink":"justin-mccarthy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[137,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/8023/58023v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,214],"assets/images/resized/0005/8023/58023v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[196,214],"assets/images/resized/0005/8023/58023v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Trapster.com","raised_amount":1700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"50,000 Downloads in iTunes Store","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/06/trapster-speed-trap-app-dowloads-hit-50000day/","source_text":"","source_description":"Trapster Speed Trap App Downloads Hit 50,000/Day","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Trapster","permalink":"trapster"}},{"description":"5 million user mark","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/309424/trapster-smashes-5-million-user-mark","source_text":"","source_description":"TRAPSTER SMASHES THE 5 MILLION USER MARK","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Trapster","permalink":"trapster"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[81,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/1834/61834v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[136,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/1834/61834v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,412],"assets/images/resized/0006/1834/61834v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
