Consumers get notifications (deals, events, new products) on their smartphones, which entice them to visit more often the merchants they love.</p>\n\n<p>Mowingo&#8217;s robustness and outstanding metrics have been field-proven at a number of northern California merchants, including a very successful deployment at dozens of McDonald’s restaurants in San Francisco and in San Jose.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike your typical deal-of-the-day app, Mowingo offers are extremely well targeted: users select which stores and restaurants to follow – and a merchant&#8217;s offers are auto-targeted to individual customers, based on their interests and past behaviors. The result is high relevancy for users and high ROI for merchants. Merchants control Mowingo through an easy to use dashboard.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0012/7821/127821v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0012/7821/127821v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,109],"assets/images/resized/0012/7821/127821v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Dreymann","permalink":"daniel-dreymann","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/9751/49751v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/9751/49751v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/9751/49751v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ehud","last_name":"Grunfeld","permalink":"ehud-grunfeld-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product & Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Gopalakrishnan","permalink":"jay-gopalakrishnan","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1000 Elwell Ct. #101","address2":"","zip_code":"94303","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Series Seed: $450K ","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Mowingo","permalink":"mowingo"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/1763/171763v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/1763/171763v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0017/1763/171763v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/1764/171764v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/1764/171764v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0017/1764/171764v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
