This means no more switching back and forth between Facebook and Google to chat with parties from either or. For example, Tom and Jerry can communicate while Tom is in class on his computer using Google Talk and Jerry is at home on his iPad using Facebook Chat.</p>\n\n<p>Thru.im benefits businesses who want to engage their customers through simple text-based conversation. Reaching the consumer is every businessâ€™ goal and what better way to do so than direct communication?  Thru.im enables restaurants to send text-based deals to their customers&#8217; real time preferred networks, driving incremental sales that would not have occurred either wise.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/3745/133745v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/3745/133745v2-max-250x250.png"],[[319,108],"assets/images/resized/0013/3745/133745v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Chad","last_name":"Stark","permalink":"chad-stark","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4825/134825v2-max-150x150.png"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/4825/134825v2-max-250x250.png"],[[201,260],"assets/images/resized/0013/4825/134825v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Spiro","permalink":"david-spiro","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"TechArb","address1":"201 S.
