Each user creates a list of shareable resources&#8211;from tools to toys to talents&#8211;and then invites her friends to join her network and create their own resource lists. </p>\n\n<p>When a user needs a resource (a hacksaw, for instance), he can search the resource lists of everyone in his network, then submit a request for the resource, with start and end dates and a brief note. The friend who receives the request can grant or deny it; if a request is granted then the software creates a transaction record for the shared resource and sends a reminder when the it&#8217;s due to be returned.</p>\n\n<p>The Sharonimo software can also be used to plan and manage projects and events&#8211;from community service projects to dinner parties&#8211;that combine friends and resources. Additional free features are under development, as is a premium subscription version of the software.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0004/0951/40951v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/0951/40951v1-max-250x250.png"],[[313,76],"assets/images/resized/0004/0951/40951v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Sharonimo Beta","permalink":"sharonimo-beta","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Andrews","permalink":"jon-andrews","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Coburn","permalink":"aaron-coburn","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BorrowMe","permalink":"borrowme","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0004/8835/48835v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0004/8835/48835v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,88],"assets/images/resized/0004/8835/48835v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Neighborrow","permalink":"neighborrow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0008/8518/88518v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/8518/88518v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,70],"assets/images/resized/0008/8518/88518v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/0687/40687v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0004/0687/40687v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,262],"assets/images/resized/0004/0687/40687v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
