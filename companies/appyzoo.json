It is developed by AppyZoo Inc. </p>\n\n<p>Many parents use their iPhones as a &#8220;babysitter&#8221; because kids (3-5 yrs old) love it vs traditional toys. The problem: most apps don&#8217;t help parents to prepare kids for school because they are either too fun (games) or boring (education apps). </p>\n\n<p>Stickery is a story-based suite of apps built by 2 ex-Stanford entrepreneurs &amp; an award-winning kids&#8217; media producer. All our game content is based on preschool curriculum standards &amp; approved by educators. Our apps collect usage data to generate progress reports for parents. These reports help them track the learning value of playtime on the iPhone. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/6248/126248v2-max-150x150.png"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/6248/126248v2-max-250x250.png"],[[426,427],"assets/images/resized/0012/6248/126248v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Stickery","permalink":"stickery","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0012/6247/126247v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0012/6247/126247v2-max-250x250.png"],[[340,57],"assets/images/resized/0012/6247/126247v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder ","person":{"first_name":"Fadly","last_name":"Mahdar","permalink":"fadly-mahdar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bjorn","last_name":"Lee","permalink":"bjorn-lee","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jarrold","last_name":"Ong","permalink":"jarrold-ong","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6127/46127v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6127/46127v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/6127/46127v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
