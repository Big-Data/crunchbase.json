What separates UberSpat from its competitors is that UberSpat is focused on the evidence.  By focusing on the evidence, UberSpat becomes a research tool as well as a debating site.  For example is the debate topic is &#8220;Man causes global warming&#8221;, users can add evidence to support and to oppose this debate.  The evidence can then be rated by other users.  All of this information then becomes extremely beneficial to people that want to know more about both sides of the debate.  They can simply read all of the best articles from either side.  That&#8217;s what makes this an amazing site.  It becomes something of a cross between Digg, Wiki, and Google.  It&#8217;s also a lot of fun, so give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>http://www.uberspat.com</p>\n\n<p>http://youtube.com/watch?v=iVK6vaWinjU</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/2601/22601v2-max-150x150.png"],[[101,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/2601/22601v2-max-250x250.png"],[[101,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/2601/22601v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Yakman","permalink":"brian-yakman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"UberSpat Office","address1":"1651 North Collins Blvd.","address2":"Suite 250","zip_code":"75081","city":"Richardson","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":32.967912,"longitude":-96.693509}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
