Considered-purchase and B2B companies use Influitive&#8217;s web-based solutions to execute customer advocate programs.</p>\n\n<p>Influitive provides virtual VIP customer advocate communities to give advocates what they want â€“ recognition, access to people they are interested in meeting, and special privileges only available to them. Our unique adaptive matching engine connects advocates to the most suitable advocacy opportunities, and makes these essential activities frictionless and fun.  The Influitive vision is that no qualified prospect should be alone in their buying process - they should be nurtured by active customer advocates that are the perfect fit to meet their needs.</p>\n\n<p>Influitive&#8217;s VIP customer advocate communities are free.  Companies pay only for real revenue value, such as trusted referral leads and reference calls scheduled.</p>\n\n<p>Influitive software integrates with LinkedIn and salesforce.com, to make it easy for advocates and qualified prospects to join the community, and to tie advocate activities with pipeline value.  Future planned integrations include demand generation software such as Eloqua and Marketo, and broad-use community software such as Jive and Lithium.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0012/7676/127676v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/7676/127676v2-max-250x250.png"],[[276,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/7676/127676v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Organ","permalink":"mark-organ","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CPO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Crow","permalink":"david-crow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/9471/129471v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0012/9471/129471v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,301],"assets/images/resized/0012/9471/129471v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/2401494568/\" title=\"Kris Krug\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kris Krug</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Belfor","permalink":"victor-belfor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/0426/160426v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0016/0426/160426v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,370],"assets/images/resized/0016/0426/160426v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>VICTOR BELFOR</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Architect","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Brunner","permalink":"ryan-brunner","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Belfor","permalink":"victor-belfor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0016/0426/160426v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0016/0426/160426v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,370],"assets/images/resized/0016/0426/160426v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>VICTOR BELFOR</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Crowd Factory","permalink":"crowdfactory","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/4273/4273v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,57],"assets/images/resized/0000/4273/4273v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,57],"assets/images/resized/0000/4273/4273v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Zuberance","permalink":"zuberance","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0002/9611/29611v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/9611/29611v4-max-250x250.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/9611/29611v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3.75M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/influitive-raises-3-75-million-from-11-investors-in-seed-preferred-round-for-customer-advocate-platform/","source_description":"Influitive Raises Unusual $3.75 Million Seed Round From 11 Investors For Customer Advocate Platform","raised_amount":3750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":8,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"San Francisco Office","address1":"1839 15th Street","address2":"Suite 463","zip_code":"94103","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
