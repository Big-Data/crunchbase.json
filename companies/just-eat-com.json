To consumers Just-Eat provide convenient and easy access to a huge variety of delivery restaurants and order food online, and to restaurants they help improve their business by increasing their exposure and providing new revenue streams. </p>\n\n<p>Today Just-Eat is the world&#8217;s leader in online takeaway ordering. As of early 2012 Just-Eat has activities on four continents and more than 25 000 restaurants on their network, with more than 10 000 in the UK alone. </p>\n\n<p>The roots of Just-Eat originate in Denmark where the company was first incorporated in 2000 and then launched in 2001.  After some initial years of boot strapped growth the company slowly started to internationalise, beginning with the UK launch in 2006. The internationalisation of the company gained momentum in 2009 when Just-Eat had their series A investment round and received £10.5 million from Index Ventures. </p>\n\n<p>Whilst headquartered in London, UK, Just-Eat operate with significant local teams in all their market countries and consider the energy and quality of Just-Eat&#8217;s local activities critical to success. </p>\n\n<p>In March 2011 a second round of investment saw two leading US venture capitalists, Greylock Partners and Redpoint Ventures, invest £30million. Greylock Partners have previously invested in Facebook, LinkedIn and Wonga. Just-Eat&#8217;s parent company is Just-Eat Holdings Limited.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/3425/63425v10-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/3425/63425v10-max-250x250.png"],[[325,71],"assets/images/resized/0006/3425/63425v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Klaus","last_name":"Nyengaard","permalink":"klaus-nyengaard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CPO","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Read","permalink":"daniel-read-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CDO","person":{"first_name":"Rasmus","last_name":"Wolff","permalink":"rasmus-wolff","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Morgado","permalink":"carlos-morgado","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Wroe","permalink":"mike-wroe","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing
