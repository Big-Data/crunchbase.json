Our new paradigm encompasses writing, publishing, social media and emerging technologies like smartphones and tablets to create completely new book reading experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Papertrell is targetted at books that offer non-linear reading patterns – such as – reference, self-help, cook books, essays or any other kinds of non-fiction that we don’t often read from cover to cover in order.
