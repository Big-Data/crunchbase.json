We believe that the popularity of the real-time and social aspects of the web represent a radical shift in how people use and interact with the Internet. The future is about dynamic streams of information, not static pages.  It&#8217;s about push, not pull; it&#8217;s about enabling publishing tools and data; and it&#8217;s about the ways we touch, experience and interact with the Internet and each other. With this as our focus, we build and invest in great companies.</p>\n\n<p>We represent a new way to grow companies.  Because we are not a fund, we can invest more flexibly in ideas. We build and work closely with companies that we view as core to our vision, including <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bitly-2\" title=\"bitly\">bitly</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/chartbeat\" title=\"Chartbeat\">Chartbeat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/socialflow\" title=\"SocialFlow\">SocialFlow</a>.</p>\n\n<p>betaworks also makes seed-stage investments in the ecosystem of the realtime web. To us, seed investing means &#8220;first money in.&#8221; Our typical investment size is $150,000-200,000. We sometimes invest as part of a syndicate of angels and early stage VCs.</p>\n\n<p>Our requirements from an investment perspective are simple, though narrow. Investments must be early stage, heavily tech focused, and have a working (public or private) prototype. We are a powerpoint-free zone.</p>\n\n<p>The company is different than a traditional venture capital firm in that it operates as a stock company with shareholders and not a firm with limited  partners.</p>\n\n<p>betaworks was the original investor in <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/summize/\" title=\"Summize\">Summize</a> and <a href=\"www.crunchbase.com/company/tweetdeck\" title=\"TweetDeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>. Both companies were acquired by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter/\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>. (The company is now a shareholder in Twitter.)</p>\n\n<p>The company often co-invests with NYC-based investors including <a
