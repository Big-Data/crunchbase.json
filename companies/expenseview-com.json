It only works with expense and income transactions entered by the user.  It does not collect any account information either.  This provides total security since the data is completely anonymous.  </p>\n\n<p>The other reason for this manual entry approach is that keeping track of expenses should take some effort.  Entering transactions and seeing an expense breakdown makes for better educated consumers.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, the site will be adding native IPhone, Android, Symbian and Blackberry apps.  This will make it easier for users to view and add transactions easier on the go.</p>\n\n<p>The other goal is to also share the collective data with our users in an easily searchable way.  We hope this will help users to make truly informed purchasing decisions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0007/6213/76213v2-max-150x150.png"],[[217,51],"assets/images/resized/0007/6213/76213v2-max-250x250.png"],[[217,51],"assets/images/resized/0007/6213/76213v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rens","last_name":"Methratta","permalink":"rens-methratta","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0007/7715/77715v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0007/7715/77715v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0007/7715/77715v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Mint.com","permalink":"mint","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-150x150.png"],[[194,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-250x250.png"],[[194,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wesabe","permalink":"wesabe","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/0061/61v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[129,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/0061/61v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[129,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/0061/61v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"416 Lincoln St.","address2":"","zip_code":"02451","city":"Waltham","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0007/6211/76211v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0007/6211/76211v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0007/6211/76211v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/6212/76212v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0007/6212/76212v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,304],"assets/images/resized/0007/6212/76212v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.listio.com/reviews/2009/01/expenseview-keeping-balance-with-expenses/","title":"ExpenseView: Keeping Balance With Expenses"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/expenseview-com-track-your-expenses-online","title":"KillerStartup.com"},{"external_url":"http://download.cnet.com/ExpenseView-Gadget/3000-18553_4-10690794.html","title":"CNet - IPhone Web App Review"}]}
