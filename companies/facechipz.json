No one can arbitrarily contact them.  No one can search for them.  Itâ€™s the social network they collect, but doesnâ€™t collect them.</p>\n\n<p>FaceChipz have the weight, look and feel of a high-end casino chips &#8211; on the head-side is &#8230;a face &#8211; an emoticon.  On the tail side is  a code.  The initial collection has 200, (now on sale at ToysRus). </p>\n\n<p>This is how FaceChipz works: kids register each FaceChipz token online by entering the unique code on the back of the chip into the FaceChipz code reader. Once the FaceChipz are registered, kids (â€œGiversâ€) hand them out to friends or to someone (â€œReceiverâ€) they would like to become friends with.  The Receiver goes online and enters in the same unique code from the back of the FaceChipz.  The FaceChipz database confirms the friendship and the two are linked.  Once a FaceChipz token is registered by both the Giver and Receiver, it cannot be used again.  (The code becomes invalid â€“ ensuring that if a chip fell into unwanted hands, a stranger could not link to the previous holder.)</p>\n\n<p>The website was designed for tweens who want to communicate freely with their friends, but who arenâ€™t comfortable with navigating an open social network.  For the children the site is fun and the chips are collectible.  For the parents the site is SAFER and the chips affordable.  FaceChipz has also been awarded the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB.org) and SociallySafe.com&#8217;s cyber safety best practices seals.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,73],"assets/images/resized/0007/1186/71186v1-max-150x150.png"],[[144,73],"assets/images/resized/0007/1186/71186v1-max-250x250.png"],[[144,73],"assets/images/resized/0007/1186/71186v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"FaceChipz","permalink":"facechipz","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Zaloom","permalink":"george-zaloom","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Sheppard Mullin","permalink":"sheppard-mullin","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[82,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/1187/71187v1-max-150x150.png"],[[113,205],"assets/images/resized/0007/1187/71187v1-max-250x250.png"],[[113,205],"assets/images/resized/0007/1187/71187v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.dozenkids.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=838:facechipz-the-future-of-kids-networks&catid=109:news-articles&news=news_desc&Itemid=41","title":"FaceChipz-The Future of Kids Networks"},{"external_url":"http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kids/news/story/0,28277,1947090,00.html","title":"Time Holiday Gift Guide Featuring FaceChipz"},{"external_url":"http://www.netfamilynews.org/2009/10/tools-sites-aimed-at-better-kid-time.html","title":" sites aimed at better kid time online "},{"external_url":"http://www.momlogic.com/2009/10/facechipzcom_social_networking_for_tweens.php","title":"FaceChipz.com could be the answer to a concerned mother's prayers"},{"external_url":"http://www.palisadespost.com/news/content.php?id=5407","title":"FaceChipz Founder's Profile"},{"external_url":"http://www.family-friendly-fun.com/family-fun/facechipz.htm","title":"FaceChipz aims to transform the way tweens communicate"},{"external_url":"http://themombuzz.com/2009/10/30/facechipz-social-networking-for-teens-launches-november-1st-win/","title":"FaceChipz provides a safe, age-appropriate networking site for tweens."}]}
