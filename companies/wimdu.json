Whether it is a private trip or a business trip—anyone who likes individual living and does not like to stay overnight in hotels will find a diverse selection of unique accommodation all over the world at www.wimdu.com.</p>\n\n<p>At www.wimdu.com, anybody can offer their flat, house or even a room in a shared flat to travellers. The host benefits from additional income and provides travellers with a completely new perspective on the holiday destination. Rooms furnished with a personal touch and helpful insider tips let holidaymakers explore cities and countries like a local—hence the slogan &#8220;Travel like a local.&#8221; Depending on the budget and your own needs, you can find diverse categories from rooms in shared flats in Tokyo to two room flats in Berlin and even penthouses in New York. </p>\n\n<p>Transparency and security are top priorities for www.wimdu.com. A provider can require a deposit, for example, but must also create a complete profile to ensure that the potential renter has important information such as pictures or contact information. Guests as well as hosts can give ratings and comment on their experiences with each other and these flow into the Wimdu ratings system. This ensures that trips are a reliable and trusting experience for both sides. </p>\n\n<p>www.wimdu.com has launched in 11 languages and in addition to Europe is active in Asia as well as North and South America. Along with the opportunity to submit and search for accommodations, the platform also offers background information ranging from travel tips to virtual guided tours. The comprehensive social media strategy allows users all over the world to exchange experiences and inform themselves via video channels, Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. Serial entrepreneurs Arne Bleckwenn and Hinrich Dreiling, who successfully launched gratispay.de in 2009, founded Wimdu. Rocket Internet finances the Berlin-based start-up.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0013/7592/137592v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0013/7592/137592v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,116],"assets/images/resized/0013/7592/137592v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Product Officer/ CPO","person":{"first_name":"Yani","last_name":"Kalafatis","permalink":"yani-kalafatis","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Lead Developer / CTO","person":{"first_name":"Frederik","last_name":"Vollert","permalink":"frederik-vollert-4","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Wolfram","last_name":"Graetz","permalink":"wolfram-grtz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/3672/113672v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,185],"assets/images/resized/0011/3672/113672v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,185],"assets/images/resized/0011/3672/113672v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Mariano","last_name":"Kostelec","permalink":"mariano-kostelec","image":{"available_sizes":[[[92,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/2150/162150v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[154,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/2150/162150v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[278,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/2150/162150v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Technical Lead / CTO","person":{"first_name":"Frederik","last_name":"Vollert","permalink":"frederik-vollert","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/6912/176912v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/6912/176912v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,360],"assets/images/resized/0017/6912/176912v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Frederik Vollert</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"PR","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Mashup Communications","permalink":"mashup-communications","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0004/8253/48253v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,229],"assets/images/resized/0004/8253/48253v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[356,327],"assets/images/resized/0004/8253/48253v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"title":"UK & France","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Ballou PR","permalink":"ballou-pr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0007/6052/76052v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/6052/76052v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[179,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/6052/76052v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$90M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/investors-pump-90-million-into-airbnb-clone-wimdu/","source_description":"Investors Pump $90 Million Into Airbnb Clone Wimdu","raised_amount":90000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Kinnevik","permalink":"kinnevik","image":null},"person":null},{"company":{"name":"Rocket Internet","permalink":"rocket-internet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0014/4182/144182v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0014/4182/144182v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[290,67],"assets/images/resized/0014/4182/144182v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Wimdu GmbH","address1":"Ohlauer Strasse 43","address2":"","zip_code":"10999","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Yani Kalafatis joins Wimdu as Chief Product officer, formerly having worked for Google as Group Product Manager (2008-2011)","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Wimdu","permalink":"wimdu"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"243\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-ae633XJdZA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"243\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VU40obZG2Cs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0018/5207/185207v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,202],"assets/images/resized/0018/5207/185207v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,364],"assets/images/resized/0018/5207/185207v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.gutscheinzeiger.de/wimdu/","title":"Coupons for wimdu"}]}
