Not only was there an opportunity to directly connect communities with local farmers and food producers, ordering food online and using a just-in-time home delivery system meant a better product and convenience for customers.</p>\n\n<p>Since it was established, SPUD has grown from a local organic produce supplier to a full-fledged online grocery store with over 5000 items to choose from. With SPUD&#8217;s online delivery service, you get the freshest local and organic produce and grocery items delivered to your door.  </p>\n\n<p>SPUD serves and supports 6 urban areas in North America. These great communities include Los Angeles &amp; Orange County, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle &amp; the Eastern Puget Sound area, Vancouver, Calgary, and Victoria &amp; Vancouver Island to Nanaimo.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0021/1695/211695v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0021/1695/211695v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,151],"assets/images/resized/0021/1695/211695v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"van Stolk","permalink":"peter-van-stolk","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"1660 East Hastings Street","address2":"","zip_code":"V5L1S6","city":"Vancouver","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Los Angeles","address1":"21136 S.
