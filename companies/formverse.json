FormVerse’s patented Active Structured Email™ technology adds structured forms and workflow capabilities to Outlook, transforming corporate email from an informal, unstructured medium to a highly structured one, and enabling organizations to leverage email as an agile and ubiquitous BPA tool. No other company has taken the approach of delivering a cost-effective BPA solution within an organization’s standard email environment where knowledge workers spend a large percentage of their time. </p>\n\n<p>Once initial setup is complete, FormVerse empowers business personnel at all levels to automate business processes without requiring support from IT. Adoption is fast and easy, since no “new application” is introduced. Users no longer need to leave their email application in order to leverage this automation. Everything is done within Microsoft Outlook, and all process data is captured and available for integration with enterprise applications and databases so as to enhance corporate decision making. This is an approach to business process automation that makes sense, and FormVerse is the only company to deliver it.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder ","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Moffat","permalink":"andrew-moffat","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Gniazdowski","permalink":"arthur-gniazdowski","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO ","person":{"first_name":"Kirk","last_name":"Deinnger","permalink":"kirk-deinnger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,140],"assets/images/resized/0021/6223/216223v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,140],"assets/images/resized/0021/6223/216223v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,140],"assets/images/resized/0021/6223/216223v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President ","person":{"first_name":"Drake","last_name":"Deininger","permalink":"drake-deininger","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Appian","permalink":"appian","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/1018/21018v2-max-150x150.png"],[[138,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/1018/21018v2-max-250x250.png"],[[138,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/1018/21018v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Metastorm","permalink":"metastorm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0007/6478/76478v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,67],"assets/images/resized/0007/6478/76478v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,67],"assets/images/resized/0007/6478/76478v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal ","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Labarge Weinstein","permalink":"labarge-weinstein","image":null}},{"title":"Accounting ","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Hendry Warren LLP","permalink":"hendry-warren-llp","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters ","address1":"6139 Russell Rd.
