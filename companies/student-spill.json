Each spill is screened by Crisis Center professionals and then sent to several volunteer responders who have experienced the same problem. These trained responders often seek joy in being able to help other people with problems they wished they had had help for. Responses are vetted by Spill staff and 4-6 are delivered back to the Spiller within 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Spill was born on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison when a student was going through a hard time adjusting to college life. Students told their friends about it and it quickly spread to other schools. Student Spill, LLC was born in June of 2009 to be a broker of anonymous empathy. It provides colleges and universities with customized reporting on the prevalence of student struggles on campus, how their students compare to those of other institutions, and trending of key vulnerabilities throughout the semester.</p>\n\n<p>Though the platform was restricted to member schools in its early years, any student can now &#8220;spill&#8221; at www.spillnow.com and receive responses from peers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/6323/166323v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/6323/166323v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/6323/166323v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$420k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":420000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Announced hire of new VP technology","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Spill Inc","permalink":"student-spill"}},{"description":"We hit 1,000 spills!","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Spill Inc","permalink":"student-spill"}},{"description":"Closed a seed funding round of $430K.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":31,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Spill Inc","permalink":"student-spill"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/29729746?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/29729746\">Heidi Allstop- Spill</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user8607604\">Heidi Allstop</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>TechStars Demo Day - Boston 2011</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0016/6877/166877v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0016/6877/166877v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0016/6877/166877v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://host.madison.com/wsj/blogs/tech-and-biotech-a-website-for-college-students-to-spill/article_92352726-0cbf-11e1-8b4a-001cc4c03286.html","title":"Wisconsin State Journal"},{"external_url":"http://talknerdy2me.org/student-spill","title":"Talk Nerdy2Me"},{"external_url":"http://trendbabble.com/2011/10/spill-now-where-psychology-and-technology-meet/","title":"Trend Babble"},{"external_url":"http://www.hercampus.com/school/berkeley/spill-supporting-students-laidback-listening","title":"Her Campus"},{"external_url":"http://www.ypulse.com/supporting-students-in-stress-qa-with-heidi-allstop-of-student-spill","title":"YPulse"},{"external_url":"http://www.theracquet.net/news/spill-your-heart-out-1.2701691#.TuQtBXMxrME","title":"The Racquet"},{"external_url":"http://royalpurplenews.com/?p=3451","title":"Royal Purple"},{"external_url":"http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/organization-aims-give-students-emotional-outlet-21940/","title":"Indiana Public Media"},{"external_url":"http://www.echopress.com/event/article/id/88158/group/News/","title":"Echo Press"},{"external_url":"http://ksax.com/article/stories/S2264074.shtml?cat=10230","title":"KSAX-TV"},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/11/17/17readwriteweb-website-lends-an-ear-to-student-woes-then-r-79393.html?scp=1&sq=website%20lends%20an%20ear&st=cse","title":"New York Times"},{"external_url":"http://act.mtv.com/posts/need-to-vent-service-lets-students-spill-for-support/","title":"MTV"}]}
