BioLeapâ€™s design platform quickly predicts binding affinity based on thermodynamic principles giving drug designers new insights to efficiently create non-obvious molecules and improve existing molecules. Lack of chemical diversity has blocked the progress of many high-priority targets during the lead identification and lead optimization phase for failure to provide either a suitable chemical starting point or a replacement structural class to a doomed lead series. BioLeapâ€™s technology provides a viable alternative to high-throughput screening and traditional shape-based â€œdockingâ€ approaches. BioLeap has identified lead compounds in four collaborative ventures and is seeking new partners who are interested in exploiting its compelling compound design and engineering platform. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0007/3096/73096v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/3096/73096v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/3096/73096v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://eon.businesswire.com/portal/site/eon/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20100112005476&newsLang=en","source_description":"BioLeap, Inc.
