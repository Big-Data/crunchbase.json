The company is headquartered in Burlington, Canada, and has global design, research and development and sales offices in Canada, Mexico, Japan, Germany, United States, Taiwan, India and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Gennum Fast Facts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dr. Franz Fink, President and CEO</li>\n<li>Headquartered in Burlington, Ontario Canada</li>\n<li>Founded in 1973</li>\n<li>2010 revenue of $128 M (USD)</li>\n<li>Listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:GND)</li>\n<li>Employs approximately 400 people worldwide </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Markets:</p>\n\n<p>Broadcast Video\nOur knowledge of high-speed signal transmission technologies enables us to deliver industry-leading HDTV components for professional and broadcast video markets. Our award-winning portfolio includes SDI equalizers, crosspoints, reclockers, cable drivers, serializers, deserializers, timing and clock conditioning solutions. As a key contributor to the SMPTE, we continue to pioneer transport technologies that deliver new experiences for the video broadcast market.</p>\n\n<p>Networking, Storage and Telecom\nThe demand for more bandwidth and increased speed to support the explosion of data and video traffic over the internet is driving the need for high-speed signal integrity solutions that ensure ultra-fast data transmission in various networking, storage and telecommunications applications. To ensure the networks of today and tomorrow can meet this growing demand, Gennum leverages its expertise in high-performance, integrated module ICs and components for the high speed (10G+) optical transceiver market to offer a comprehensive suite of backplane interconnect and optical transceiver ICs including laser/modulator drivers, equalizers, SerDes, receive optical sub-assemblies (ROSAs), clock and data recovery (CDRs), re-drivers, bridges, limiting amplifiers and transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs). Our high-speed and high-performance optical transceiver component technology allows for integration and bundling advantages and our expertise positions us well for the nascent 40/100G market.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Gennumâ€™s Snowbush Division delivers high-speed digital and mixed-signal IP for the computer, networking, storage and telecom markets, accelerating product development by providing co-engineering resources and high-performance platform technology.</p>\n\n<p>Industrial Connectivity\nDesigners of industrial video applications are rapidly upgrading their existing analog-over-coaxial systems to full bandwidth HD video. Gennum AviiaTM (Advanced Video Interface for Industrial Applications) solutions meet this need with the industryâ€™s first HD video-over-coax interface for industrial imaging applications. Aviia solutions expand Gennumâ€™s leading A/V technology into new markets including video surveillance (HDcctv), machine vision, medical, digital signage, passenger infotainment, industrial imaging and video conferencing. A pioneer in this market, Gennum is a founding member of the HDcctv Alliance, an industry consortium developing HD connectivity standards for mainstream video surveillance and CCTV applications.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer Connectivity\nToday&#8217;s consumer applications require increasing levels of performance and data throughput. For example, Intel&#8217;s Thunderboltâ„¢ technology is a revolutionary new high-speed computer input/output (I/O) method that offers a quantum leap in data transfer rates compared to other standards. These unprecedented speed requirements place unique demands on the transmission media. That&#8217;s where Gennum&#8217;s expertise in the 10Gb/s datacom space comes into play. Our many years of experience with high-speed links has given us the unique capability to rise to the challenges of Thunderboltâ„¢ with the industry&#8217;s first high-speed solutions for Thunderboltâ„¢ applications.</p>\n\n<p>Intellectual Property (IP)\nGennum&#8217;s Snowbush IP group addresses the need for the design and delivery of silicon-proven, high-speed serial interface IP. The Snowbush IP portfolio includes complete, integrated, PHY and controller solutions for standards such as SuperSpeed USB, PCI ExpressÂ® and Serial ATA (SATA), and single and multi-standard SerDes for applications with data rates from 1 Gb/s to over 10 Gb/s. Gennum&#8217;s Snowbush IP group is committed to supporting customers with diverse foundry and process requirements.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0013/1919/131919v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0013/1919/131919v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0013/1919/131919v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Franz J.
