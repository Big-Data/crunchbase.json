Our architecture operates invisibly at the desktop, instead of at the network level. This means two important things: first, our software is easier and less expensive to implement than competitors, with far lower total cost of ownership. Second, it affords a higher level of protection against a range of business risks from the theft or loss of valuable intellectual property and customer data, losses in employee productivity, theft of company laptops, employee misconduct, regulatory compliance. </p>\n\n<p>Please visit:\nwww.interguardsoftware.com\nwww.laptopcopsoftware.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0003/8697/38697v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0003/8697/38697v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0003/8697/38697v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"InterGuard","permalink":"interguard","image":null},{"name":"Laptop Cop","permalink":"laptop-cop","image":null},{"name":"WebWatcher","permalink":"webwatcher","image":null},{"name":"SONAR","permalink":"sonar","image":null},{"name":"DATALOCK","permalink":"datalock","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Fuhrman","permalink":"peter-fuhrman-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Miller","permalink":"brad-miller","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/9591/149591v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[165,206],"assets/images/resized/0014/9591/149591v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[165,206],"assets/images/resized/0014/9591/149591v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Fuhrman","permalink":"peter-fuhrman","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Bilyeu","permalink":"tom-bilyeu","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Vontu","permalink":"vontu","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Websense","permalink":"websense","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0003/4948/34948v3-max-150x150.png"],[[239,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/4948/34948v3-max-250x250.png"],[[239,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/4948/34948v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"SpectorSoft","permalink":"spectorsoft","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0005/7669/57669v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/7669/57669v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[209,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/7669/57669v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Absolute Software","permalink":"absolute-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0002/2827/22827v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/2827/22827v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2827/22827v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"McAfee","permalink":"mcafee","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Symantec","permalink":"symantec","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/7569/17569v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[226,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7569/17569v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[226,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7569/17569v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"4640 Admiralty Way","address2":"STE 1010","zip_code":"90292","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":33.9812355,"longitude":-118.44097}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/0886/40886v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0004/0886/40886v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0004/0886/40886v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
