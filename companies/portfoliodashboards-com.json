They have experience on both sides of a deal, having both raised investments and invested in early-stage companies. They have a personal network of thousands of professional investors, ranging from seed-stage angels to later-stage venture capitalists.</p>\n\n<p>There mission is to provide a platform that will drive greater efficiency in the relationship between investor and entrepreneur. This includes better visibility, consistent and standardized reporting, and an easier method to compare venture investments. The entrepreneur finds value in PortfolioDashboards as it takes less time to report on company performance and also provides a streamlined way to notify and request information and help from investors.
