There are thousands of topics to choose from, and you can learn in the best method suited for you with ease and speed.</p>\n\n<p>The &#8220;social&#8221; in Socialdecks comes from the power of connections made on Socialdecks. Users meet other respected members as societies based on their recognition on the leaderboard or respective profile badges, as well as even just by using useful/insightful decks built by masterminds. Users have made hundreds of connections on the site, and they have helped people learn and grow in an entirely new way.</p>\n\n<p>Every new feature released is taken under consideration for user response, user friendliness, and user usage. This is exemplified by the simplicity of such features as signing up, which requires only 3 quick and easy fields, card creation, which requires only 2 fields, or even deck compilation, which requires only 1 field to be filled out, then you click your way through the simple, interactive application to form your deck.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t force you to sign up for many of the features. In fact, in current setup, you can browse, search, view, analyze, and interact with the application, all without even signing up or logging in. But once you log in, a feature-rich application is at your fingertips, only 3 fields and a click away!</p>\n\n<p>Some of our latest features include Socialdecks Groups, a portion of the site dedicated to classes and groups of people collaborating together on a single topic, such as a spanish class or physics class working together to study for an upcoming exam and the Socialdecks Online Store, a simple way to supplement your flashcard-based studying with textbooks.</p>\n\n<p>As a startup, Socialdecks strives to enhance the education process by providing a feature-rich application free of charge to a responsive and interactive audience.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[35,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/3855/23855v3-max-150x150.png"],[[35,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/3855/23855v3-max-250x250.png"],[[35,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/3855/23855v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO, Marketing/Programming","person":{"first_name":"Adwait","last_name":"Walimbe","permalink":"adwait-walimbe","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/1250/31250v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0003/1250/31250v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0003/1250/31250v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Adwait Walimbe / Socialdecks Logo</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Released Beta Version","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":11,"source_url":"http://socialdecks.com/blog/article/?id=3","source_text":null,"source_description":"Beta Release","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"SocialDecks","permalink":"socialdecks"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
