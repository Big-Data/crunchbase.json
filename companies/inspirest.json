Small businesses drive the economy; shouldnâ€™t everyone have a chance to be in the driverâ€™s seat?</p>\n\n<p>How\nâ€”â€”-\nWe interview entrepreneurs and business owners and post then interview online for others to read and become inspired. We conduct interviews in person and via tele-conference, create a write-up of the inspirational story, and then publish it on our website. We also have a very unique resource informational center that entrepreneurs can use to help motivate themselves to grow their business.</p>\n\n<p>How Inspirest Got Started\nâ€”â€”â€”â€“\nThe company was started by an entrepreneur who is eager to encourage entrepreneurship, now it is a team of two. We decided that the best way to promote and inspire others to pursue entrepreneurship is by publishing inspirational entrepreneurial stories from other successful business owners. The site started with an interview of a successful 24 year consultant and it hasnâ€™t slowed down since. Now with over 10 interviews and over 50 planned for 2011, the website is still growing strong. We also added an additional interviewer to assist with the additional requests for interviews.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
