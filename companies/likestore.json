Is the first social commerce specialist in Latin America. Merges the influence of social media with the power of e-commerce. Enables any-sized retailers to sell products to Facebook users through an easy to use platform. Likewise, develops customized social commerce apps for big brands.</p>\n\n<p>As you may know, Brazil is going through a transformation in its economy and a digital revolution is emerging from this. Thus, brazilians are the most intense social media users in the world. Almost 85% of the local internet users declare that social media is one of the main reasons to get online regularly. To put the power of this heavy usage in perspective, take the average number of friends in social networks for instance. The global average is 130 friends, while, in Brazil, is 231.</p>\n\n<p>On the top of that, e-commerce is growing fast in the country as well. There are more than 23 million people buying goodies online regularly. Just in 2010, the amount of sales on the web grew more than 41%, compared to 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the advantages of these great conditions in the country, the service was launched in the 2nd quarter of 2011 in Brazil.
