Itâ€™s\na no-hassle small job marketplace where things get done quicker for less.</p>\n\n<p>Business Summary: \nBy matching rated workers with jobs &amp; automating the\nprocess, gotSkillz reinvents how the small jobs are done. Those with limited\nbudget will be able to complete their projects, and those needing work will apply\nthemselves. It&#8217;s a win-win. GotSkillz focuses on common jobs that occur\nfrequently and that can be completed by anyone with matching skills. Revenue\nwill come from micro-payments and premium membership.</p>\n\n<p>Customer Problem:\nThe people that have the skills to complete small jobs donâ€™t\nhave a way of finding leads. Those that need work done canâ€™t afford expensive\ncompanies, but don&#8217;t know how to find a reputable local worker.\nProduct/Services: Anyone can register as a worker in just a few minutes and be\nnotified of new jobs they have the skills to complete. When they submit their\noffers, the job poster can review and shortlist them. Once an offer is selected\nand the job is complete, one can rate the worker.\nJobs can be posted even faster.</p>\n\n<p>Target Market: \nWe observed interest in being a worker from students,\nprofessionals (unemployed, self-employed or additional income) and\nhomemakers. The job posters are generally homeowners.\nWith poor economic conditions and high unemployment rate, the opportunity to\noffer employment projects and more affordable services is increasingly growing\n(â€œ20% 2009-2010 increase with 200M annual revenueâ€ â€“ Service Magic, 60M\nannual revenue- Angie&#8217;s List).</p>\n\n<p>Customers (test release):\nStudents (graphics design, photography), homeowners (home repair,\nlandscaping), application developers, pc maintenance, instrument &amp; language lessons,&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>Sales/Marketing Strategy: \nOur marketing efforts will focus on reaching everyday commuters (people who are too busy to do\nthings themselves), the unemployed, the homeowners, and the students. We are looking to take advantage of conventional\nmarketing (radio, newspaper, and mailed fliers) with on-line advertising through Facebook (that gotSkillz ingrates with),\nTwitter, and Google. The initial efforts will be geographically focused in NJ and NYC.</p>\n\n<p>Business Model: \nA hybrid of revenue generating models: micropayment for a job postings &amp; job offers ($0.99) and premium\nmembership with added features. Eventually, targeted ads may become an additional revenue stream.</p>\n\n<p>Competitors: \nCompetition (large to small): ServiceMagic.com, AngiesList.com, 1800.contractor.com, BidClerk.com,\nCraigslist.org, Thumbtack.com, Taskrabbit.com\nThe large ones focus strictly on home repair jobs; the smaller ones are mostly about on the go jobs (errands) and lack the\nstructure and simplicity. All of them are relatively pricey and focus on workers instead of consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Competitive Advantage: \nGotSkillz focuses on small jobs and unlike the competition, does the matching automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Management: \nBoth co-owners bring over 10 years of IT experience with\nemphasis on web technologies, social networking, and crowd sourcing. Despite\nbeing successful senior professionals at their day jobs, they really want to create their own product that would appeal to a lot of people. They implemented\ngotSkillz in just 3 months despite having full-time jobs and families (â€œOur energy\nlevel, creativity, and mind-sets are hard to match.â€).</p>\n\n<p>Complete business plan available upon request.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8470/118470v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0011/8470/118470v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0011/8470/118470v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Radziszewski","permalink":"adam-radziszewski-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"White","permalink":"bruce-white","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/1044/121044v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0012/1044/121044v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0012/1044/121044v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Angie's List","permalink":"angies-list","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/7144/17144v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/7144/17144v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[262,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/7144/17144v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ServiceMagic","permalink":"servicemagic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/9468/29468v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/9468/29468v3-max-250x250.png"],[[304,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/9468/29468v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Thumbtack","permalink":"thumbtack-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0006/7664/67664v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/7664/67664v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,67],"assets/images/resized/0006/7664/67664v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xEHBCsoDmCE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Elevator Pitch Video</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xEHBCsoDmCE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Elevator Pitch Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[137,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8463/118463v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8463/118463v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[412,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/8463/118463v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8464/118464v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[223,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8464/118464v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[401,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/8464/118464v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0011/8465/118465v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0011/8465/118465v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0011/8465/118465v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8466/118466v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8466/118466v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[391,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/8466/118466v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0011/8467/118467v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,194],"assets/images/resized/0011/8467/118467v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,349],"assets/images/resized/0011/8467/118467v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8468/118468v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8468/118468v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/8468/118468v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0011/8469/118469v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0011/8469/118469v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0011/8469/118469v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
