The product allows users to more easily track project goals and overall objectives in a collaborative online interface.  All members of a firm or party can set up goals and projections (financial, product or customer related) and then track those goals with the software. It&#8217;s not free - PlanHQ costs between $9 and $45 per month. Most of its customers are choosing the high end plan.</p>\n\n<p>One contention is that board members and high executives may be unwilling to make their plans and methods so transparent. Yet, firms such as First Round Capital and others have begun testing it (though not funding the company).  Although planHQ may work best for venture firms, the product is certainly viable for startups, small businesses and advisors.  </p>\n\n<p>planHQ is a 6 person company with 180 clients only months after launching in April of 2007.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/1030/1030v3-max-150x150.png"],[[162,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1030/1030v3-max-250x250.png"],[[162,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1030/1030v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"planHQ","permalink":"planhq","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Norton","permalink":"tim-norton","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0002/5791/25791v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,147],"assets/images/resized/0002/5791/25791v2-max-250x250.png"],[[166,147],"assets/images/resized/0002/5791/25791v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Tim Norton Personal Pic</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Designer","person":{"first_name":"Amiria","last_name":"Paterson","permalink":"amiria-paterson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Olliver","permalink":"jeremy-olliver","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0005/9609/59609v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,229],"assets/images/resized/0005/9609/59609v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[436,401],"assets/images/resized/0005/9609/59609v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Shobita Jones / <a href=\"http://www.madefromnewzealand.com/businesses/creative-minds\" title=\"Creative Eye\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Eye</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Rod","last_name":"Drury","permalink":"rod-drury","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,130],"assets/images/resized/0003/3730/33730v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[97,130],"assets/images/resized/0003/3730/33730v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[97,130],"assets/images/resized/0003/3730/33730v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Koziarski","permalink":"michael-koziarski","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP -
