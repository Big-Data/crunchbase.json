This affords anyone who measures marketing initiatives the ability to make better strategic use of their time as well as their marketing dollars.</p>\n\n<p>How BringShare works </p>\n\n<p>Simplicity is a key driver of BringShare&#8217;s platform. Anyone can begin evaluating their online marketing spend and performance metrics with three easy steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Connect all of your accounts (Google Analytics, Facebook, Twitter, email marketing, etc.) to your secure BringShare account</li>\n<li>View dashboards showing results for each channel as well as a master dashboard showing all channels combined</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>BringShare subscribes to the &#8220;less is more&#8221;¬ù theory. The less complicated the tool is, the more effective it becomes for its users. </p>\n\n<p>The benefits of BringShare:</p>\n\n<p>A smarter process makes for a smarter marketer </p>\n\n<p>BringShare&#8217;s time-saving tool gives valuable time back to the marketing team so they can spend more time doing what they were hired to do in the first place. That in itself is smart, but BringShare also takes the guesswork out of determining what works and what doesn&#8217;t by providing a comprehensive, easy-to-understand picture of marketing, which makes any BringShare user a smarter marketer as they make informed decisions that grow market share.</p>\n\n<p>Cost-effective measurement that truly impacts the bottom line</p>\n\n<p>BringShare offers affordable, customizable plans that meet the strategic needs of businesses just starting out as well as those leveraging multiple marketing channels. Our mid-range plan (Complete) is less per month than the average cost of one billable hour of a mid-level marketing professional. And while we&#8217;ve all heard that you have to spend money to make money, we think a better proposition is spend less and make more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0017/4104/174104v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,47],"assets/images/resized/0017/4104/174104v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,47],"assets/images/resized/0017/4104/174104v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, COO","person":{"first_name":"Danielle","last_name":"Walton","permalink":"danielle-walton","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0017/4221/174221v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0017/4221/174221v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[309,220],"assets/images/resized/0017/4221/174221v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Spring","permalink":"justin-spring","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/4095/174095v2-max-150x150.png"],[[206,219],"assets/images/resized/0017/4095/174095v2-max-250x250.png"],[[206,219],"assets/images/resized/0017/4095/174095v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mac","last_name":"Liaw","permalink":"mac-liaw","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member/Investor","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Butler","permalink":"michael-butler-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/0908/130908v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/0908/130908v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0013/0908/130908v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"BringShare Headquarters","address1":"815 Grandview Ave","address2":"Suite 600","zip_code":"43215","city":"Columbus","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xjmrA49AWRU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>BringShare Web Analytics</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0015/7507/157507v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0015/7507/157507v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,348],"assets/images/resized/0015/7507/157507v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0017/3312/173312v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0017/3312/173312v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,348],"assets/images/resized/0017/3312/173312v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/13/demo-bringshare-marketing-data/","title":" Demo: BringShare combines your marketing analytics tools in one place by VentureBeat"},{"external_url":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3093021a-e0ad-11e0-947a-00144feabdc0.html","title":"Sifting through technology start-ups by Financial Times"},{"external_url":"http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/show-reports/287823-new-tools-for-managing-online-marketing-at-demo-fall","title":"New Tools For Managing Online Marketing at Demo Fall by PC Magazine"}]}
