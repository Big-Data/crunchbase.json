Users will never miss out on any offer, promotion or anything thatâ€™s new in a business.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Aditya","last_name":"Shenai","permalink":"aditya-shenai","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
