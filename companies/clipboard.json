We think so too, which is why we built an easy and powerful tool to help you.</p>\n\n<p>All of this may sound simple, but we think it&#8217;s actually quite significant. We believe that someday soon everyone will be saving and organizing their online life in a way that is easy, fun and reflective of themselves. It is a world where everyone is highly engaged and active in saving their life experiences online.</p>\n\n<p>We are here for you and we are in this for the long haul. Our mission is to help you organize your online life.
