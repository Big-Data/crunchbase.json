Unlike the two major players in stock photo sales (Corbis and Getty), Fotolia&#8217;s images are mostly from semi-pro and amateur photographers, though the photos are of similar quality. Fotolia photographers earn 30%-60% of the sales revenue from their images.</p>\n\n<p>In an effort to compete with Corbis and Getty, Fotolia introduced a service called Infinite Collection in December 2007, offering buyers a selection of over 100,000 high-resolution photos that are from some of the most renowned photography collections at a low cost ($20-$100 per image) to use in their web sites.  Fotolia competes with major stock houses like <a href=\"http://www.corbis.com\" title=\"Corbis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Corbis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com\" title=\"Getty\" rel=\"nofollow\">Getty</a> as well as micro-stock houses like <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/istockphoto\" title=\"iStockPhoto\">iStockPhoto</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/shutterstock\" title=\"Shutterstock\">Shutterstock</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On June 17th Fotolia announced a partnership with <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pingg\" title=\"Pingg\">Pingg</a>, an online invitation and event managment website.  The partnership integrates Fotolia&#8217;s collection of images directly into the Pingg platform and  powers the pingg Plus+ application.  The API is integrated into the site allowing users to license images from the Fotolia database for a fee directly through the Pingg site.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0011/0243/110243v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/0243/110243v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,50],"assets/images/resized/0011/0243/110243v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Fotolia","permalink":"fotolia","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Thibaud","last_name":"Elziere","permalink":"thibaud-elziere","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3868/103868v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3868/103868v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[406,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3868/103868v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder
