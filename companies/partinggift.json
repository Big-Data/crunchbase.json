Their team of developers, designers and project, marketing and sales personnel is based in Hyannis, Massachusetts. </p>\n\n<p>PartingGift, LLC is pleased to announce their official launch, with the rollout of their first project for international client Dunkinâ€™ Brands. </p>\n\n<p>PartingGiftâ€™s engagement with Dunkinâ€™ is part of the quick-serve restaurant chainâ€™s desire to leverage Facebook and other social media beyond â€œLikesâ€ and links. On Your Mark! â€“ featured on Dunkinâ€™s Facebook page â€“ simulates the drive through experience from the â€œotherâ€ side of the window. Players are challenged to quickly and accurately make iced coffee orders for drive through customers, competing for a chance to win $10 Dunkinâ€™ gift cards. </p>\n\n<p>The beta test of the game with Dunkinâ€™s crew resulted in extremely high interaction times â€“ an average of about 60 minutes per player. According to PartingGift CEO/CTO Brad Crowell, â€œFor brands, PartingGift offers the unique combination of long-format engagement and an experience that is exquisitely personal.â€ On Your Mark! will run through August 31, 2011 and is the first in a series of coffee games PartingGift is developing to help Dunkinâ€™ educate consumers about new products and initiatives. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond delivering a strong marketing message and driving brand revenue through prizes and coupons, PartingGiftâ€™s piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance is their market research capability. By using clever gameplay and viral tools to help predict what consumers will buy tomorrow, â€œThe virtual focus group setting (otherwise known as social media) facilitates authentic consumer insights, in real time, says Crowell. â€œAnd if brands can predict the future, they can optimize for it.â€</p>\n\n<p>PartingGift runs its platform in the cloud via Microsoftâ€™s Windows Azure, providing their clients with maximum up time, stability, and data security. As a Microsoft BizSpark partner, PartingGift will be also featured in a video available this month via MicrosoftBizSpark&#8217;s Channel on YouTube.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0014/7847/147847v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0014/7847/147847v2-max-250x250.png"],[[361,151],"assets/images/resized/0014/7847/147847v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Crowell","permalink":"brad-crowell","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"PartingGift, LLC","address1":"540 Main Street","address2":"","zip_code":"02601","city":"Hyannis","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"520\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://media.partinggift.com/games/PGFacebookTabFramework.swf?gameid=16&gameuid=96d39572-863f-4834-9041-efa0d7136897\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"('wmode', \" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://media.partinggift.com/games/PGFacebookTabFramework.swf?gameid=16&gameuid=96d39572-863f-4834-9041-efa0d7136897\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"450\" height=\"520\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>On Your Mark!
