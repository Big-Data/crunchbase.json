Lotus is most commonly known for the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application, the first feature-heavy, user friendly, reliable and WYSIWYG-enabled product to become widely available in the early days of the IBM PC, when there was no Graphical User Interface. Such a useful tool certainly helped to spread the adoption of the PC, both for administrative and scientific applications. Much later, in conjunction with Ray Ozzie&#8217;s Iris Associates, Lotus also released a groupware and email system, Lotus Notes. IBM purchased the company in 1995 for $3.5 billion, primarily to acquire Lotus Notes and to establish a presence in the increasingly important client-server computing segment, which was rapidly making host-based products like IBM&#8217;s OfficeVision obsolete.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Development_Corporation\" title=\"Source: Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source: Wikipedia</a>, accessed 2/12/10. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Papows","permalink":"jeff-papows","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Architect","person":{"first_name":"Barry","last_name":"Spencer","permalink":"barry-spencer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0616/50616v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[224,234],"assets/images/resized/0005/0616/50616v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[224,234],"assets/images/resized/0005/0616/50616v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Sami","last_name":"Shalabi","permalink":"sami-shalabi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,122],"assets/images/resized/0005/7466/57466v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[95,122],"assets/images/resized/0005/7466/57466v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[95,122],"assets/images/resized/0005/7466/57466v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":3500000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Development_Corporation","source_description":"","acquired_year":1995,"acquired_month":null,"acquired_day":null,"acquiring_company":{"name":"IBM","permalink":"ibm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
