Oxygen Accelerator is designed to nurture groups or individuals and create workable companies that will produce marketable and innovative technology solutions of the future.  In addition to the vision to help develop real businesses, the impetus was to create a sustainable tech community outside of the hub of the capital, and to draw in more talent worldwide to cities of equal technological standing.</p>\n\n<p>The 13-week, full time boot camp will run from 1st September 2011 and will combine investment with intensive training and mentoring for 10 selected groups or individuals that applied through http://oxygenaccelerator.com and selected after careful assessment by a panel of judges.  The successful teams will then be situated in the heart of technological innovation at BSPA, which will help promote inspiration and provide access to state-of-the-art facilities â€“ all aiming to propel these burgeoning companies to success.  Furthermore, the nurturing and mentoring from like-minded successful entrepreneurs, business people and investors will help these business-minds of the future to be equipped with all the tools to take their business to the next level and beyond.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4655/134655v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/4655/134655v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/4655/134655v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder ","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Hales","permalink":"mark-hales","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Accelerator Manager","person":{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Jenner","permalink":"simon-jenner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/3464/103464v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0010/3464/103464v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[368,261],"assets/images/resized/0010/3464/103464v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Faraday Wharf","address2":"Holt Street ","zip_code":"B7 4BB","city":"Birmingham","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/3792/133792v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/3792/133792v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/3792/133792v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
