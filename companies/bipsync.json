In addition, portfolio managers currently lack the diagnostic capability to remedy these inefficiencies. BipSync addresses these issues by enabling investors to quickly grab information they come across while researching a particular company, industry or investment theme from a wide range of sources (incl. web, pdf, email) and store them in an intelligent manner which can be retrieved effortlessly, on any device. Research tasks such as routine spreadsheet analyses and production of investment memos are automated. Workflow tools help investors manage their pipeline of ideas and run diagnostics to identify performance-killing bottlenecks. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0021/3627/213627v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0021/3627/213627v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,157],"assets/images/resized/0021/3627/213627v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Donado","permalink":"danny-donado","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6309/216309v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/6309/216309v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/6309/216309v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Customer Development","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Cameron","permalink":"james-cameron-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0021/5997/215997v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0021/5997/215997v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0021/5997/215997v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Palo Alto","address2":"","zip_code":"94031","city":"","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/5999/215999v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0021/5999/215999v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0021/5999/215999v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
