Furthermore, the incapability of the traditional job industry to cater for start ups exacerbates this problem.\nJublia solves that by developing a series of job matching events to help the best techies and startups discover each other through focused face-to-face interaction enhanced by a real-time digital layer (online platform and mobile interaction tools). We want them to interact before judging them based on their CVs.\nMutual interests are indicated online and matched algorithmically prior to the event to formulate interaction schedules. Associated mobile tools provide real-time scheduling and allow reviews after each interaction. We leave participants with useful reviews-based profiles.\nWhat differentiates us is our emphasis on the power of choices and the value of face-to-face interactions. In effect, Jublia aims to transform recruitment.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0018/1194/181194v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0018/1194/181194v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0018/1194/181194v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
