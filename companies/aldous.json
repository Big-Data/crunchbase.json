This may be achieved in a single customer interaction and guarantees an order able to be provisioned.</p>\n\n<p>Aldous covers all channels, including the direct channel which allows high value customers to place orders through a self-service web interface - without any involvement from the technical sales force.</p>\n\n<p>Needs Analysis ensures that customers are presented with the best products and configuration to match their needs. Product configuration capability guarantees that for both simple and complex products, a â€œclean ticketâ€ is submitted to order management. The â€œclean ticketâ€ enables rework to be reduced to less than 5%. As many communication service providers have up to 55% rework, this represents a massive cost saving. Service delivery time is also drastically reduced leading to a lower cost of sale, an increase in revenue velocity and higher customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>Aldous natively presents users with up-sell and cross-sell recommendations as well as bundle detection or near bundle detection to maximize product and services exposure. This drives increased ARPU and customer retention.</p>\n\n<p>All order types are supported, with pre-built templates available for most products, including (but not limited to) Mobile Solutions, MPLS based IP-VPN, IP TV, PSTN and Broadband.</p>\n\n<p>Aldous enables use of the â€œas-soldâ€ representation of a customerâ€™s installed base in conjunction with contractual data and â€œas-builtâ€ information, if available, from the network inventory to produce valid MACD orders.</p>\n\n<p>Aldous is able to provide the functionality described above by utilizing a data driven J2EE application powered by a constraint based rules engine using eTOM processes and SID models.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0005/0664/50664v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0005/0664/50664v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[258,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/0664/50664v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Aldous OES","permalink":"aldous-oes","image":null},{"name":"Aldous OFMS","permalink":"aldous-ofms","image":null},{"name":"Aldous PLM","permalink":"aldous-pim","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0005/1047/51047v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0005/1047/51047v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[258,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/1047/51047v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Bates","permalink":"andrew-bates","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/6626/146626v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/6626/146626v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/6626/146626v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"EVP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Patrice","last_name":"Arnera","permalink":"patrice-arnera","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"United Kingdom - Windsor","address1":"59-60 Thames St","address2":"","zip_code":"SL4 1TX","city":"Windsor","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.485299,"longitude":-0.6077302},{"description":"New Zealand - Auckland","address1":"Aldous House","address2":"111 Wellesley Street West","zip_code":"1010 ","city":"Auckland","state_code":null,"country_code":"NZL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
