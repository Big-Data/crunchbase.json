These interviews are searchable by topic, expert, and question. </p>\n\n<p>The founders of Big Think originally envisioned the site as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com\" title=\"YouTube\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a> for intellectuals. Over time the site has also become a source of primary information for college students and corporate learning programs.
