There, the user can write a personal comment, up to 100 characters \nThe info provided and the username will appear at the “Live Ticker”, a location-aware, relative time text. All signed in members at a radius of 10 kilometers can see it and spot the exact location.\nAll traffic information, without comments, is integrated in the “top roads” section. That is, a second screen in BuddyTraffic’s interface. There, you will find a sum of all streets, jammed or open.\nUser input will also appear at the location aware “Text Feed”, where all nearby posts and updates are presented. The notable feature here is the “Ask Him” button, which allows instant messaging between members.\nUser input and traffic updates lead to virtual badges and real-life rewards.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0021/3278/213278v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0021/3278/213278v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,99],"assets/images/resized/0021/3278/213278v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / Lead UI-UX Designer","person":{"first_name":"Gert","last_name":"Tzafa","permalink":"gert-tzafa","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Takis","last_name":"Karalivanos","permalink":"takis-karalivanos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Yannis","last_name":"Psarras","permalink":"yannis-psarras","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / Marketing and PR","person":{"first_name":"Panagiotis","last_name":"Melissaropoulos","permalink":"panagiotis-melissaropoulos","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/46255274?title=1&amp;byline=1&amp;portrait=1\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/46255274\">BuddyTraffic</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user12656011\">BuddyTraffic</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>The idea behind BuddyTraffic</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0021/3272/213272v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,194],"assets/images/resized/0021/3272/213272v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,350],"assets/images/resized/0021/3272/213272v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0021/3273/213273v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,122],"assets/images/resized/0021/3273/213273v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,220],"assets/images/resized/0021/3273/213273v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0021/3274/213274v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0021/3274/213274v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0021/3274/213274v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0021/3275/213275v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0021/3275/213275v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,263],"assets/images/resized/0021/3275/213275v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0021/3276/213276v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0021/3276/213276v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0021/3276/213276v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0021/3277/213277v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0021/3277/213277v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0021/3277/213277v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
