Boupp creates a nationwide network of independent boutiques and aggregates their orders in order to negotiate more favorable contracts with brands.  The payoff for boutiques is better vendor discounts and better contract terms.  </p>\n\n<p>Boutiques benefit, but brands do too.  Instead of processing hundreds of purchase orders, they process one.  Brands fulfill orders faster, with more ease, and more profitability.  And they never lose visibility into individual account orders. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/3233/203233v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/3233/203233v2-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/3233/203233v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0020/3232/203232v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,118],"assets/images/resized/0020/3232/203232v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,213],"assets/images/resized/0020/3232/203232v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
