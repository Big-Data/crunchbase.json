SeeMail is personal, intimate, beautiful, fun, and easy to use.<br/>\nSeeMail appeals to all ages, has thousands of uses, and has a cool retro vibe with a mailbox icon, location postmarks, and vinyl record imagery.</p>\n\n<p>Inspiration</p>\n\n<p>In ancient times (before 2000) photos were created and shared as physical objects.  It was common practice to jot down a date or short note on the back of the photo.  &#8220;Jasper, Alberta 1973&#8221;.  That note became a part of the photo.  The note enhanced the photo and put it in context for the person viewing it.   When you shared that photo with someone  you shared the story too.  It was these photos that inspired SeeMail founder Ward Chandler to bring this experience to the digital photo sharing age.</p>\n\n<p>How it works</p>\n\n<p>SeeMail creates a unique style of mobile message inspired by the idea of sharing the story behind the photo.  SeeMail adds something special to your photos &#8230; your voice!™</p>\n\n<p>☆ Choose a new photo, or select from your library or Facebook albums\n☆ Record a SeeMail AudioT.ag™ - just tap the record button and record your voice or anything going on around you - its so cool! \n☆ Add a caption to your photo\n☆ Postmark your current location - powered by FourSquare\n☆ Share privately with your SeeMail friends\n☆ Share publicly with Facebook and Twitter\n☆ Play and share SeeMail on the web</p>\n\n<p>Team</p>\n\n<p>Founder and CEO Ward Chandler (www.linkedin.com/in/wardchandler) brings 25 years of experience, leadership, insight, vision &amp; public company office.
