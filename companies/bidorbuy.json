This payment service is called bobPay and includes payments made by credit card and EFT. Many smaller sellers are unable to qualify for credit card merchant accounts themselves and therefore opt to make use of the built in bidorbuy payment system. In addition, bidorbuy provides sellers with a variety of other tools to make it easy for them to manage their sales through the bidorbuy system.</p>\n\n<p>bidorbuy provides large sellers with customised tools to make bulk listing of products easier and can integrate directly with popular online shopping cart solutions. This together with the innovative online payment solutions offered makes bidorbuy.co.za a clear leader in the South African online buying and selling marketplace.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/6566/96566v2-max-150x150.png"],[[219,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/6566/96566v2-max-250x250.png"],[[219,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/6566/96566v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Higgins","permalink":"andy-higgins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jaco","last_name":"Jonker","permalink":"jaco-jonker","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Gerd","last_name":"Naschenweng","permalink":"gerd-naschenweng-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0017/7952/177952v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0017/7952/177952v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0017/7952/177952v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jaco","last_name":"Jonker","permalink":"jaco-jonker","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"eBay","permalink":"ebay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Taobao","permalink":"taobao","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1723/1723v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,81],"assets/images/resized/0000/1723/1723v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,81],"assets/images/resized/0000/1723/1723v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headoffice","address1":"Silverpoint Office Park","address2":"22 Ealing Crescent","zip_code":"2191","city":"Bryanston","state_code":null,"country_code":"ZAF","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"South African online marketplace, bidorbuy, has launched its Kenyan operation with over 18,000 products on offer.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":21,"source_url":"http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/111/87/52408.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"bidorbuy launches in Kenya","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"bidorbuy","permalink":"bidorbuy"}},{"description":"bidorbuy.co.za, an online auction based in South Africa, has acquired the Cape Town-based group-buying site UbuntuDeal.co.za, highlighting the group-buying craze in the e-commerce sector, worldwide.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":11,"source_url":"http://memeburn.com/2011/04/group-buying-site-ubuntudeal-is-bidorbuys-latest-acquisition","source_text":null,"source_description":"Group-buying craze: Bidorbuy snaps up UbuntuDeal","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"bidorbuy","permalink":"bidorbuy"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"288.75\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/bqTRy_Z1y3o&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/bqTRy_Z1y3o&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"288.75\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Advert</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/6565/96565v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0009/6565/96565v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,448],"assets/images/resized/0009/6565/96565v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.aboutus.org/bidorbuy.co.za","title":""},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidorbuy","title":"bidorbuy on Wikipedia"},{"external_url":"http://www.bidorbuy.co.ke","title":"bidorbuy Kenya"},{"external_url":"http://www.bidorbuy.co.ke","title":""},{"external_url":"http://blog.bidorbuy.co.za/","title":"bidorbuy blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/bidorbuy.co.za","title":"bidorbuy Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/bidorbuyvideos","title":"bidorbuy Youtube"}]}
