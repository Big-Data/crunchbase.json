For readers, fav.or.it allows users to &#8220;slice&#8221; their blog RSS feeds into relevant categories, tags, ranks, people, or dates.  Also, depending on whether the blog in question is using the site&#8217;s API, readers can add comments to the blog post directly from fav.or.it.  For publishers, in addition to integrating to allow commenting on their blog, the site will also track reader attention and be able to publish blog rankings by attentiveness measures.</p>\n\n<p>fav.or.it&#8217;s offering competes in some way with many different Web 2.0 services, from social news giant <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/digg\" title=\"Digg\">Digg</a> to commenting services like <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intensedebate\" title=\"Intense Debate\">Intense Debate</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cocomment\" title=\"CoComment\">CoComment</a> to feed readers like <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/feedburner\" title=\"FeedBurner\">FeedBurner</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0000/1774/1774v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/1774/1774v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/1774/1774v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"fav.or.it","permalink":"fav-or-it","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder, Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Halstead","permalink":"nick-halstead","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/9943/9943v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/9943/9943v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/9943/9943v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"Ranger","permalink":"julian-ranger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/7871/57871v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JulianRanger</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Digg","permalink":"digg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,158],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"coComment","permalink":"cocomment","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0001/5910/15910v2-max-150x150.png"],[[213,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/5910/15910v2-max-250x250.png"],[[213,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/5910/15910v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$712k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"Capital Report Index","raised_amount":712000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The FSE Group","permalink":"finance-south-east","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/9747/29747v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/9747/29747v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/9747/29747v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Reading Enterprise Hub, University of Reading","address2":"Earley Gate","zip_code":"RG66AU","city":"Reading","state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
