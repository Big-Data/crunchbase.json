As the logical extension of TwitterÂ®, the service operates in real time and gives users the capability of talking to one anotherâ€™s Twitter followers via telephone or mobile device through the touch of a button. Whereas Twitter can only provide a user with 140 characters to share ideas, Twalkin extends communication and conversation beyond this limitation, infusing these thoughts with a range of expression and connectivity, ultimately increasing the functionality of the already prolific Twitter communication platform. With Twalkin, each call or â€œTwalkâ€ allows users to chat with friends, conference with business colleagues, or broadcast to tens, hundreds, thousands, and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Twalkin is launching with an open source developerâ€™s API, allowing developers to integrate Twalkinâ€™s functionality and framework into current and future work, unlocking the real time conversation tool so it may become a component of an unlimited variety of applications. The API positions Twalkin to become part of the fabric of social networks as a conversation tool, offering a visceral, interactive, and real time extension to these platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Twalkin users are able to initiate and moderate conference calls with a visual interface on their web browser or mobile device. The goal is for users to create and join conferences on the fly at the touch of a single button. Twalkinâ€™s technology offers users the unique ability to initiate conferences between a handful of people or\nbroadcast to several thousand. The platform also allows for anonymous calls and private conferences.</p>\n\n<p>The initial feature set for Twalkin at launch includes:\nÂ· One touch conferencing\nÂ· Live broadcasting\nÂ· User moderation controls, determining who can speak\non a Twalk in real time\nÂ· Free iPhone app available from the iPhone app store\nÂ· Twalks accessible through any mobile phone or landline\nÂ· A website with easy to use features for account creation\nand maintenance\nÂ· Swift signâ€up process for Twitter users\nÂ· Open public Twalks listed by category, subject or\npopularity on home page, with access info\nÂ· Twalk scheduling\nÂ· Twalks announced via tweet, email or SMS text</p>\n\n<p>While in a conference (or â€œtwalkâ€), the dashboard allows a\nTwalkin moderator to control:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Call duration</li>\n<li>Caller Limit</li>\n<li>Private Access Credentials</li>\n<li>Selective Mute/Unmute</li>\n<li>Boot/Block Users</li>\n<li>Broadcast Mode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once the twalk ends, the conversation is stored in mp3\nformat to be accessed by participants at a later date.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/3808/63808v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0006/3808/63808v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[424,186],"assets/images/resized/0006/3808/63808v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Fischler","permalink":"anthony-fischler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, President","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Scriven","permalink":"thomas-scriven-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/3896/63896v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0006/3896/63896v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0006/3896/63896v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Gillette","permalink":"ryan-gillette","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Mauldin","permalink":"joshua-mauldin","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Publicist","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Jay Marose","permalink":"jay-marose","image":null}},{"title":"Lawyer, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, LLP","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Eddie Rodriguez","permalink":"eddie-rodriguez","image":null}},{"title":"IP Lawyer, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, LLP","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"James Cleary","permalink":"james-cleary","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.trendcentral.com/WebApps/App/SnapShots/Article.aspx?ArticleId=7710","title":"Trend Central"},{"external_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Twalkin-Announces-Launch-of-bw-2895641135.html?x=0&.v=1","title":"Yahoo!"}]}
