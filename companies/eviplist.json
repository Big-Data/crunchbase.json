Everything on eVIPlist.com is user-submitted. After you submit content, other people read your submission and â€œeVIPâ€ what they like best. If your content receives enough eVIPs, itâ€™s promoted to the top of it&#8217;s category. The new web 2.0 user powered content platform allows users to post news, pictures, events and videos.  Users are then able to interact with the posts by voting, commenting, saving, burying and/or forwarding the content to friends. eVIPlist fills a unique void in the social media arena through its niche content focus on African Americans. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/7221/17221v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/7221/17221v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/7221/17221v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"livesteez","permalink":"livesteez","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Global Grind","permalink":"globalgrind","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4477/4477v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/4477/4477v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/4477/4477v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Digg","permalink":"digg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,158],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ShoutWire","permalink":"shoutwire","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/4892/14892v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/4892/14892v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[289,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/4892/14892v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Reddit","permalink":"reddit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"4401-A Connecticut Ave.  NW","address2":"Suite 349","zip_code":"20008","city":"Washington","state_code":"DC","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.945762,"longitude":-77.063922}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/7419/47419v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/7419/47419v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0004/7419/47419v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
