At gramble, we are developing a truly cross platform social gaming experience where developers can utilize our value-adding tools and publish only quality games in a clutter-free ‘blue ocean’ environment. Our number 1 focus is mobile and tablet technology.</p>\n\n<p>Players will have a quality assured and customizable social gaming experience, incorporating a high degree of social connectivity, as well as having peace of mind that a percentage of all their monetization goes to charitable causes, as selected by each and everyone one of our players. Gramble’s foundation investor and a key strategic partner is Novamedia. For more than 20 years, Novamedia has operated the charity-focused Postcode Lotteries in Europe. Supported by ambassadors such as Bill Clinton, Rafael Nadal and Sir Richard Branson – and thanks to millions of players around the world, the Postcode Lotteries have raised more than US$5 billion to support charities – including a whopping US$700 million last year.</p>\n\n<p>Gramble’s goal is to create a mobile social gaming network that will host a suite of compelling and entertaining social games from developers across the world. Our players will socially connect and play games with their friends and family on the gramble platform that will be playable across many different devices – be it a smart phone, tablet, desktop, or even a TV.</p>\n\n<p>Gramble has big plans to attract outstanding developers – both big and small – to its social platform to create the number 1 mobile social gaming network in the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1178/171178v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[239,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1178/171178v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[431,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1178/171178v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder
