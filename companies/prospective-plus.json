Our application and SaaS platform allows employers to go beyond an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or simple resume submission and begin by searching by objective factors and move on to see more, meaningful information about the candidate. We provide a gateway between new graduates and the employers who recruit them. Prospective Plus helps recruiters find qualified candidates based on meaningful data and help both parties make the best decisions for themselves while reducing screening time and hiring with culture fit in mind - which allows for reduced turnover.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"Farber","permalink":"phoebe-farber-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
