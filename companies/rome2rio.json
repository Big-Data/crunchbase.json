The technology is showcased through the freely available travel search site www.rome2rio.com. </p>\n\n<p>The Rome2rio technology offers a novel approach to travel search that can accept any address, landmark, town, national park or other feature as the input origin and destination. Rome2rio searches a purpose-built repository of air, train, ferry, mass transit and bus routes, walking directions and driving directions to present several alternative travel plans between the origin and destination. Each itinerary may involve travelling on a combination of different transport modes.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-modal travel search solutions are scarce: the technology is challenging, and from a content perspective global surface transport data is highly fragmented. Rome2rioâ€™s solution is elegant, stable and fast, with search results typically delivered in half a second or less. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/9380/129380v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/9380/129380v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/9380/129380v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Interim CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rod","last_name":"Cuthbert","permalink":"rod-cuthbert","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Cameron","permalink":"michael-cameron","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,131],"assets/images/resized/0012/9383/129383v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[98,131],"assets/images/resized/0012/9383/129383v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[98,131],"assets/images/resized/0012/9383/129383v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Bernhard","last_name":"Tschirren","permalink":"bernhard-tschirren","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,131],"assets/images/resized/0012/9557/129557v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[98,131],"assets/images/resized/0012/9557/129557v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[98,131],"assets/images/resized/0012/9557/129557v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Software Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Ash","last_name":"Verdoorn","permalink":"ash-verdoorn","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development Manager","person":{"first_name":"Ed","last_name":"Hooper","permalink":"ed-hooper","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/8421/128421v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,135],"assets/images/resized/0012/8421/128421v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,135],"assets/images/resized/0012/8421/128421v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>No rights reserved</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$450k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.tnooz.com/2012/05/29/news/rome2rio-grabs-450000-investment-round-appoints-ex-viator-boss-as-interim-ceo/","source_description":"Rome2Rio grabs $450,000 investment round, appoints ex-Viator boss as interim CEO","raised_amount":450000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":28,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Guy","last_name":"King","permalink":"guy-king","image":{"available_sizes":[[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/5854/15854v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/5854/15854v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/5854/15854v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Guy King</p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Bevan","last_name":"Clark","permalink":"bevan-clark","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Melbourne","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Rome2rio raises $450,000 in seed funding, appoints interim-CEO","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":29,"source_url":"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/05/29/travel-search-firm-rome2rio-goes-b2b-raises-450k-and-appoints-interim-ceo/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Travel search firm Rome2Rio goes B2B, raises $450k and appoints interim CEO","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"rome2rio","permalink":"rome2rio"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZotBFarcUkE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Introduction &amp; Tour</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0012/9637/129637v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0012/9637/129637v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0012/9637/129637v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
