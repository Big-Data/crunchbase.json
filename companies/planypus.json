You called up maybe a couple people, maybe dropped some emails or sent some text messages. But the movie starts in an hour and you don&#8217;t want to spend it trying to organize your friends to go. All it takes is ten seconds on Planypus to let your friends know you&#8217;re going to the movies, and they can organize themselves to meet you there.</p>\n\n<p>Planypus works by notifying your friends in whatever way they prefer, be it email, sms, rss, or by integrating into your online homepages and calendaring tools, so everyone always knows what&#8217;s going on. You can set up your notification preferences and learn how to integrate Planypus with your calendar in your profile.
