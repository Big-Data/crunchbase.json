By providing both hardware and software components, viaCycle offers a &#8220;bike-sharing-in-a-box&#8221; solution: a combined system that frees bike-sharing operators from cumbersome kiosks and street-storage, increasing flexibility and reducing costs.</p>\n\n<p>Bicycle sharing systems are a developing solution for preserving urban mobility, but suffer from numerous issues that prevent widespread adoption, including high costs and vandalism rates.  Moreover, existing bike share systems require extensive stationary infrastructure, including bike racks and checkout kiosks that are difficult to install and limit rider freedom. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, viaCycle bicycles can lock up to traditional bike racks, and are checked in and out using text messages or smart phone applications. The lack of infrastructure reduces implementation and operating costs. Additionally, operators know where all their bikes are at all times and whom their checked out to, which reduces administrative workload and cuts down on theft.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0012/3482/123482v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0012/3482/123482v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,347],"assets/images/resized/0012/3482/123482v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Yuriy","last_name":"Romaniw","permalink":"yuriy-romaniw","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kyle","last_name":"Azevedo","permalink":"kyle-azevedo","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":" COO","person":{"first_name":"Koji","last_name":"Intlekofer","permalink":"koji-intlekofer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Sid","last_name":"Doshi","permalink":"siddharth-doshi","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"30308","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
