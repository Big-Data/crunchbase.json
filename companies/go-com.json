Disney expanded Go.com beyond the entertainment portal concept. In addition to its own content, the company used the site as a hub for other Disney-related sites, including ABC.com and Disney.com. Go.com also hosted personal web pages. In early 2000, with visits to the site dropping, Disney announced that the general portal would now focus more on entertainment. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0005/2564/52564v1-max-150x150.png"],[[202,94],"assets/images/resized/0005/2564/52564v1-max-250x250.png"],[[202,94],"assets/images/resized/0005/2564/52564v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Design Director","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Macadaan","permalink":"mike-macadaan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/2560/52560v12-max-150x150.png"],[[247,247],"assets/images/resized/0005/2560/52560v12-max-250x250.png"],[[247,247],"assets/images/resized/0005/2560/52560v12-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0005/2565/52565v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0005/2565/52565v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0005/2565/52565v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
