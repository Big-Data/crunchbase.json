It’s a subscription-based service streamed to any digital device connected to the Internet, including Smartphone’s, TV’s, tablets, and personal computers. </p>\n\n<p>Mobile MUM fills a void in the multi-billion dollar annual online marketplace for a safe and secure environment that parents can trust on the internet for children’s educational entertainment. At present, children’s content is sold as individual episodes, or, as an afterthought, by online providers such as Netflix which, to date, is only segmenting content for families, or, such as Nick Jr., only making selective shows available online.
