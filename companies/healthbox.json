Our focus is to find companies that have the potential to grow – either new companies already starting to serve the market, or entrepreneurs with creative solutions who need help formalizing their business models.</p>\n\n<p>Through a competitive application process, ten entrepreneurs/teams will be selected to participate in a three-month accelerator program in Chicago. During the course of the three months, each company will be expected to develop a work plan and make meaningful progress on key milestones by leveraging the program’s resources. Ultimately, each company will have the opportunity to form new partnerships, find beta customers and raise additional capital through the program’s network.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the three-month program, angel and venture investors from around the country will be invited to an event where each entrepreneurial team will give their pitch for funding. The day will also provide the opportunity for broader informal networking and learning from guest speakers.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Nina","last_name":"Nashif","permalink":"nina-nashif","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Phillips","permalink":"dan-phillips","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/blue-cross-blue-shield-massachusetts-140000670.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Geckocap","permalink":"geckocap","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0022/3822/223822v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,160],"assets/images/resized/0022/3822/223822v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,288],"assets/images/resized/0022/3822/223822v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sandbox Industries","address1":"213 N Racine Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"60607","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/healthbox-chicagos-new-health-focused-startup-accelerator-debuts-its-inaugural-batch/","title":"Healthbox: Chicago’s New Health-Focused Startup Accelerator Debuts Its Inaugural Batch"},{"external_url":"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-chicago-healthfocused-startup-chooses-10-firms-for-first-class-20111220,0,1978217.story","title":"Chicago health-focused startup chooses 10 firms for first class"}]}
