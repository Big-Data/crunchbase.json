Over the last six years, the power consumed by servers has more than doubled.</p>\n\n<p>SeaMicro, backed by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/draper-fisher-jurvetson\" title=\"Draper Fisher Jurvetson\">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/khosla-ventures\" title=\"Khosla Ventures\">Khosla Ventures</a>, is building solutions that will revolutionize the data center landscape.</p>\n\n<p>SeaMicro has identified the primary drivers underlying power inefficiencies in servers and has systematically rectified these shortcomings. The result is a small form factor server that uses one-quarter of the power and requires only one-sixth of the space used by traditional servers. SeaMicro servers are plug-and-play—they require no changes to software operating systems, applications, or management infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about SeaMicro, please contact us at info@seamicro.com </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0007/8835/78835v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/8835/78835v3-max-250x250.png"],[[306,64],"assets/images/resized/0007/8835/78835v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$35M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Draper via TC","raised_amount":15000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":24,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ)","permalink":"draper-fisher-jurvetson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://gigaom.com/cleantech/seamicro-raises-20m-for-low-power-servers/","source_description":"SeaMicro raises $20M for low power servers","raised_amount":20000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":7,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":334000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash_and_stock","source_url":"http://www.seamicro.com/node/242","source_description":"AMD Completes Acquisition of SeaMicro","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":3,"acquired_day":23,"acquiring_company":{"name":"AMD","permalink":"amd","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0017/3361/173361v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0017/3361/173361v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,263],"assets/images/resized/0017/3361/173361v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
