Whether to get some â€œrealâ€ work done, go to a meeting, or even on vacation, AwayFind makes sure that the urgent messages the user specifies still finds them.</p>\n\n<p>AwayFind does not require any installation or learning curve, and it supports all major email platforms including Google Apps/Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo Mail, and IMAP.</p>\n\n<p>The company has been featured by The New
