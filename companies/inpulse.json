It has downloadable watchfaces and internet-connected apps that you can view from your watch. </p>\n\n<p>Pebble connects to iPhone and Android smartphones using Bluetooth, alerting you with a silent vibration to incoming calls, emails and messages. </p>\n\n<p>Some apps that are being built are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cyclists can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. </li>\n<li>Runners get a similar set of data displayed on their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. </li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re a golfer, bring Pebble onto the course. inPulse is working with Freecaddie to create a great golf rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses world-wide. Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to the green right on your wrist.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0018/4138/184138v1-max-150x150.png"],[[178,65],"assets/images/resized/0018/4138/184138v1-max-250x250.png"],[[178,65],"assets/images/resized/0018/4138/184138v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
