Internet users can then  type keywords into the search box to find  result pages containing those links.</p>\n\n<p>The basic concept behind Aglepie is that any search result page is basically a piece of real estate. We provide our members with the posibility to own these search result pages.</p>\n\n<p>A result page also called a &#8220;PiePage&#8221; is created by a website owner. The name of the piepage is the same as the search query that was typed in by the user.\nSo when a user search for &#8220;aglepie&#8221; they will find the piepage named &#8220;aglepie&#8221;.\nOn joining a website owner will receive free piepages. They can use these to create (name) new piepages.</p>\n\n<p>The position of the website owner who created the piepage, will always be on top. So when users search for&#8221;aglepie&#8221; they will find the link of the website owner, in this case aglepie.com, on top. This link is called a &#8220;blue piead&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>The website owner can add text, but also images, videos, tweets etc. to their piead. This information can be updated any time the website owner wants.</p>\n\n<p>If other website owners want to place their link on a  piepage  they did not create,  they have to settle with a â€œwhite pieadâ€ on that page. The difference between the two, blue pieads are permanent and always stay on top of the page while white pieads move op a list according to their most recent update.</p>\n\n<p>If  the piepage name is a trademark of your company, you can turn that piepage into a trademark piepage. This means that you alone can place links on that piepage. You can further personalize your trademark piepages by adding a background image.</p>\n\n<p>Members who do not have a trademark, can turn a piepage that contains their website url, into a trademark piepage. For example, â€œaglepie.comâ€ can become a trademark piepage, but so can â€œaglepie.com/our-favorite-websites/â€. \nAs long as its one continues word with your domain name in it, you can turn it into a trademark piepage.</p>\n\n<p>There is great freedom when creating piepages and pieads, members are only limited by their creativity and a few rules to keep it all honest.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0009/0430/90430v2-max-150x150.png"],[[238,62],"assets/images/resized/0009/0430/90430v2-max-250x250.png"],[[238,62],"assets/images/resized/0009/0430/90430v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/3273/113273v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[173,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/3273/113273v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[311,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/3273/113273v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.toptut.com/2010/07/15/is-aglepie-search-engine-right-for-you/","title":"Is Aglepie Search Engine Right for You?"}]}
