Under the logo, â€œXtreme Greenâ€, these green powered products include extreme sports vehicles such as Jetboards, jet skis, ATVs, and snowmobiles as well as everyday products such as motorcycles, light trucks, police mobility vehicles, motor scooters, go carts, people movers, and golf cars.</p>\n\n<p>Designed with proprietary energy management systems and electric propulsion systems, each Xtreme Green product has all the power and ability of gas powered engines, but without the particulate pollution or noise pollution! At Xtreme Green, we believe that our products will become the new wave and standard in Xtreme sports and everyday electric powered living.</p>\n\n<p>The Company is currently completing design and will begin production of an electric powered Xtreme Green Jetboard in 2009. This electric board will further open the market for riders into environmentally protected lakes and rivers that do not allow gas engines.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0003/1749/31749v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0003/1749/31749v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0003/1749/31749v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Sanford","last_name":"Leavitt","permalink":"sanford-leavitt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Chief Officer of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Neil","last_name":"S.
