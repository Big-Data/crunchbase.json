Web-based businesses have largely democratized the planning and booking experiences around travel, but the actual &#8220;day-of&#8221; travel is a very large, untapped market - GateGuru is leading this charge.   GateGuru currently works on iOS and Android devices.  </p>\n\n<p>The Company which is led by former venture capitalist Dan Gellert, closed their initial round of financing in May 2011.  Investors in the round included Chamath Palihapitiya, Allen Morgan, Brad Harrison (BH Ventures), Tom Glocer, Matt Daimler (SeatGuru Founder), Thomas Lehrman and several other prominent angel investors.   </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/4228/114228v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/4228/114228v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/4228/114228v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$800k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/airport-info-app-gateguru-launches-on-android-raises-800k/","source_description":"Airport Info App GateGuru Launches On Android; Raises $800K","raised_amount":800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":29,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Allen","last_name":"Morgan","permalink":"allen-morgan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0258/10258v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[171,230],"assets/images/resized/0001/0258/10258v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[171,230],"assets/images/resized/0001/0258/10258v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Chamath","last_name":"Palihapitiya","permalink":"chamath-palihapitiya","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/0700/10700v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0001/0700/10700v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0001/0700/10700v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jalani Morgan on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jalanimorgan/\" title=\"flickr\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr</a></p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Glocer","permalink":"tom-glocer","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Lehrman","permalink":"thomas-lehrman-2","image":null}},{"company":{"name":"BHV","permalink":"brad-harrison-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0011/5424/115424v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/5424/115424v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[189,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/5424/115424v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Bradley","last_name":"C.
