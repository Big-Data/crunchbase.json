They can redeem their points for item and gift vouchers, cash and more with any business partner or with mplifyr.  mplifyr uses a universal points system and has global capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals are ranked on our Rankings Page according to the number of credits they earn from purchasing or doing positive acts. Individuals can compete with others globally on the platform and everyone can see this on the main Rankings page. They can gain status badges and even obtain a portion of our Pile O’ Cash every random rewards session.</p>\n\n<p>Businesses can use mplifyr to create an affordable, customizable and simple rewards program in minutes and can set up a variety of rewards, redemptions and deals. </p>\n\n<p>Each time a business purchases reward points from mplifyr to give to their customers who purchase or interact with them, a proportion of that purchase is attributed to the Pile O’ Cash and businesses are ranked based on the amount they contribute to the Pile O’ Cash. </p>\n\n<p>The top ranked businesses can obtain status levels that give them benefits and their ranking also gives them visibility outside of traditional marketing and helps to positively brand their business, as they support positive action from individuals by funding the Pile O&#8217; Cash.</p>\n\n<p>mplifyr includes unique and purposeful tools for organizations that no other program presently offers. Organizations can now offer reward points to those who volunteer, donate or attend their events.</p>\n\n<p>More tools include personalized feeds, deal/discount search capabilities, employee and exclusive clubs for sustaining loyalty, mobile capabilities, custom activities and so much more.</p>\n\n<p>mplifyr is launching mid 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,140],"assets/images/resized/0019/1359/191359v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[239,224],"assets/images/resized/0019/1359/191359v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[239,224],"assets/images/resized/0019/1359/191359v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Duchenne","permalink":"james-duchenne","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Brendon","last_name":"Barr","permalink":"brendon-barr","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"Luna","permalink":"veronika-moon","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Candice","last_name":"Pang","permalink":"candice-pang","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sydney Office","address1":"55 Phillip St.","address2":"Unit 12","zip_code":"2150","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0019/1357/191357v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,145],"assets/images/resized/0019/1357/191357v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,261],"assets/images/resized/0019/1357/191357v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0019/1358/191358v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,145],"assets/images/resized/0019/1358/191358v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,261],"assets/images/resized/0019/1358/191358v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0019/1360/191360v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,144],"assets/images/resized/0019/1360/191360v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,260],"assets/images/resized/0019/1360/191360v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0019/1361/191361v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,145],"assets/images/resized/0019/1361/191361v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,261],"assets/images/resized/0019/1361/191361v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://gamification.co/gbase/main/categories/social-good/mplifyr/","title":"Gamification Summit Submission"},{"external_url":"http://www.seiian.com/mplifyr-blog/","title":"mplifyr blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.gsummit.com/g-awards/gawards-best-use-of-gamification-in-a-consumer-facing-application/","title":"mplifyr Nominated for a Gamification Award for \"Best Use of Gamification in a Consumer Facing Application\""}]}
