Available at their website or through a browser extension for Internet Explorer and Firefox, it claims to &#8220;improve&#8221; search results provided by Bing, Google and Yahoo.  It pulls up results from further down the rankings and produces a re-ranked subset of results around each initial one.</p>\n\n<p>Here is their pitch:</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Rather than leaving users to manually filter through static sets of links, this innovative application uses real-time behavior signals to calculate â€œinstantaneous relevanciesâ€ within a result set in order to dynamically pull forward the most pertinent results while pushing back those less germane. The technology is similarly suited for targeting sponsored links, benefiting both users and advertisers.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0001/3895/13895v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/3895/13895v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[409,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/3895/13895v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Cramer","permalink":"mark-cramer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/9527/49527v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/9527/49527v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0004/9527/49527v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Architect","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Wertheim","permalink":"mike-wertheim","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Hardtke","permalink":"david-hardtke","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Collarity","permalink":"collarity","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/1708/11708v1-max-150x150.png"],[[156,63],"assets/images/resized/0001/1708/11708v1-max-250x250.png"],[[156,63],"assets/images/resized/0001/1708/11708v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$750k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/19/hijacking-search-surf-canyon-and-managedq-rethink-the-search-experience/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":31,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/09/search-startup-surf-canyon-raises-a-seed-round/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":8,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"Blatt","permalink":"rachel-blatt","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Brackett","permalink":"tom-brackett","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Hendrickson","permalink":"john-hendrickson","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Simpson","permalink":"michael-simpson","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Pawan","last_name":"Vora, PhD","permalink":"pawan-vora-phd","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Weil","permalink":"patrick-weil","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Syzygy Enterprises","permalink":"syzygy-enterprises","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Brackett","permalink":"tom-brackett","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.80294,"longitude":-122.266978}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style=\"width:320px;\"><div style=\"background-color:#dedede;width:320px;text-align:center;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:5px;margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-06-23-surf-canyon-ceo-cramer-on-paying-for-search\" target=\"_blank\">See this video on <span style=\"color:#38538e;font-weight: bold;\">Vator</span><span style=\"color:#50a756;font-weight: bold;\">.tv</span>&nbsp;&raquo;</a></div><embed src=\"http://www.vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=3270_Surf-Canyon-Int-2--08-10.flv&b=2&i=3270&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2008-06-23-surf-canyon-ceo-cramer-on-paying-for-search\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></div>","description":"<p>Vator.tv Interview</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
