You have up to 300 words to say something beautiful, funny, controversial, scary, informative, innovative, poetical or just plain interesting. Write whatever you want, but write it well.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Wurdzl.com is a brand new website (launched just last week) aimed at bringing quality writing to discerning readers. With just 300 words we believe you can say something amazing. Wurdzls are ranked by popularity in â€˜digestsâ€™ that can be enjoyed daily, weekly and monthly. You can show your love for a particular wurdzl by giving it a â€˜wurd-upâ€™. This is a bit like a Facebook â€˜likeâ€™, however, the wurd-ups of authors whose work has a greater number or wurd-ups carry more weight â€“ this is because we believe that people who write well recognise good writing when they see it. At wurdzl.com quality is king.</p>\n\n<p>As we&#8217;ve only just started up thereâ€™s not a lot of content up there. Weâ€™re on the scout for talented writers to post their work and rate others. We would be eternally grateful if you could feature our site on techcrunch.com and give us the leg-up that we need to get this thing moving.</p>\n\n<p>Wurdzl are based just outside of London UK.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>\n\n<p>Alex</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Loveless","permalink":"alex-loveless","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
