(NYSE: NSR) is a trusted, neutral provider of information and analysis to the Internet, telecommunications, entertainment, advertising and marketing industries throughout the world. Neustar applies its advanced, secure technologies in routing, addressing and authentication to its customers’ data to help them identify new revenue opportunities, network efficiencies, and cyber security and fraud protection measures.</p>\n\n<p>Neustar was originally founded in 1996 to meet the technical and operational challenges that arose when the U.S. Government mandated local number portability. Today, Neustar solves the world’s most complex global challenges through data insights and intelligence for the Internet, telecommunications, entertainment, advertising and marketing industries. Neustar has three defined business segments: Carrier Services, Enterprise Services and Information Services.</p>\n\n<p>Within the United States and Canada, Neustar operates the authoritative directories that manage virtually all telephone area codes and numbers, and enables the routing of calls among thousands of competing Communications Service Providers (CSPs). All telecommunications service providers (TSPs) that offer telecommunications services to the public at large must access the Neustar clearinghouse to properly route virtually all of their customers&#8217;s calls. Also, Neustar provides clearinghouse services to emerging CSPs, including Internet service providers (ISPs), mobile network operators, cable television operators, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Neustar offers internal and external managed DNS services that play a key role in directing and managing traffic on the Internet, manages the authoritative directories for the .us and .biz Internet domains, and acts as the worldwide &#8220;registry gateway&#8221; for China&#8217;s .cn and Taiwan&#8217;s .tw Internet domains outside of these two countries. Neustar also operates the authoritative directory for U.S. Common Short Codes, part of the short messaging service (SMS) relied upon by the U.S. wireless industry, and provides solutions used by mobile network operators worldwide to enable mobile instant messaging for their end users.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0006/5948/65948v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0006/5948/65948v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[285,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/5948/65948v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"F Bregman","permalink":"mark-f-bregman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"A Hook","permalink":"lisa-a-hook","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Vice President, Carrier Services","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"J.
