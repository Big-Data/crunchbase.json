Our technology is a desktop application and browser plugin (2MB) that enables users to download and cache hi-def media in computer idle time, then play back inside existing websites via PHP tags. In so doing we allow webmasters to easily &#8220;SuperSize&#8221; their pages  for subscribers who have our plugin. </p>\n\n<p>WHAT PROBLEMS DO WE SOLVE?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We overcome the on-demand barrier for high definition content delivery to social network and fan-based websites.</li>\n<li>Add HD page content to existing websites via one-line code tags without expensive rebuilding of site framework.</li>\n<li>Conserve bandwidth costs by &#8220;pushing&#8221; in-demand video downloads to users in off-peak times, avoiding streaming video headaches.</li>\n<li>Save on repeat downloads of webpage graphics by allowing users to keep their favorite large video files and web page contents on their desktops long term, avoiding the need to keep re-downloading repeatedly. This is especially true for Social Network websites that have a high volume of repeat daily user downloads.  </li>\n<li>Have subscribers experience instantaneous web page load times of Hi-Def content for the first time ever! </li>\n<li>Publishers can charge extra fees to subscribers for high definition files that they can keep.</li>\n<li>Enable websites to exploit new ad revenues with a new HD pipeline to users by delivering powerful desktop apps, etc. in a secure channel they own.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>WHY IS IT REVOLUTIONARY?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We are the first company ever to provide a non-streaming solution to high definition content delivery that runs invisibly alongside low-def content inside the same website, guaranteeing smooth, high quality playback of large rich media assets for fan bases.</li>\n<li>The SuperSizeWeb browser enhancement enables web publishers to create Hi-Def duplicates of their websites - without \nrebuilding the site. Publishers can maintain a low-rez and a hi-rez version of the same site easily.</li>\n<li>Our desktop application contains the combined features of Web Servers, Download Managers and Browser rich media plugins in a tiny 2MB package.</li>\n<li>Website subscribers can experience ZERO load times for impressive full screen hi-def web experiences.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>THE BUSINESS MODEL:</p>\n\n<p>Many websites are struggling to make the transition to a High Definition web. For a fraction of a website rebuild (or high-end video \nstreaming tech implementation), Social Network and repeat-user websites can deliver hi-def experiences to their daily visitors and \nsubscribers.\nWe license our platform to companies for $250 per month, plus a $499 setup fee.\nA topical selling point is that we can save web publishers streaming, hosting, bandwidth, and website upgrade costs - which they can then re-invest in high definition aspects of their website&#8217;s future growth.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/0488/20488v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/0488/20488v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,209],"assets/images/resized/0002/0488/20488v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Mongie","permalink":"mark-mongie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Cedric","last_name":"Griss","permalink":"cedric-griss","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Nelson","permalink":"brad-nelson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$80k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":80000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":10,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"3098 Executive Parkway","address2":"","zip_code":"84043","city":"Lehi","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.427361,"longitude":-111.896722}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
