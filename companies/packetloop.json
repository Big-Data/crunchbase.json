Instead of operating on a copy of a copy of security event information Packetloop maintains full fidelity - minute-by-minute analysis over years and years of network traffic, using full packet captures.</p>\n\n<p>Packetloop analyses every packet, conversation, protocol and file for threats and deviations from normal traffic, scaling to terabytes of data,  Packetloop offers in-depth traffic analysis and powerful visualizations providing you with clear intelligence for your
