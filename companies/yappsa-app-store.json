In most cases you loose access to your apps and you will have to purchase them again or be locked in to one device platform. Yappsa solves this problem allowing users to download or access free apps, purchase or subscribe to an app then use that one app on all your devices. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"B","last_name":"Kalia","permalink":"b-kalia-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Personal Funds","raised_amount":2000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.pleasefund.us/projects/yappsa-your-apps-anywhere","title":"Video of Project"}]}
