The co-founders parted ways in March 2011 due to different visions for the future of the company. Shortly thereafter, Jeremie took over as CEO and the company closed a $8M Series A Round; he focused on redefining the company’s positioning and recruiting top talent.</p>\n\n<p>The Team?\nOur team operates at the crossroads of Engineering, Music, &amp; Business. We are located in Geneva (HQ), NY, SF and Paris.</p>\n\n<p>The Goal?\nOur first offering focuses on Promotion &amp; Management of music online. \nWhy? Because you can&#8217;t generate revenues on content that you&#8217;ve never promoted! \nMid term objective: Offer better solutions for artists/labels to generate revenues with their content through easy yet efficient solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The Target Audience?\nPrimarily aimed at solving the needs of independent artists of all sizes &amp; small to middle class labels + managers, publicists and other key music professionals.</p>\n\n<p>The Differentiators?\n• Centralize – Manage multiple artists with a single log in. All of your releases/projects are accessible on a single dashboard.\n• Collaborate – By enabling multiple users to manage a single artist’s promotion, easily share tools with the full artist team. No more sharing passwords and switching accounts.\n• Customize – Control how your music is being presented. Each track or album uploaded comes with a slick public or private promotional page and embeddable HTML5 players, with user‐friendly customization options, including commerce links. It’s about your branding, not ours.\n• Publish – Save time. Simply drag and drop multiple tracks to upload music to Official.fm, YouTube and Soundcloud in one go. No more spending hours uploading the same songs to multiple services.\n• Share – Once you decide to share, you can do so on any website or device. Fans are one click away from listening to and spreading your music.\n• Stats – Utilize Advanced statistics to know where, who, how and when. Collect e-mail addresses for each download and export them as .csv files.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/5387/25387v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0002/5387/25387v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,130],"assets/images/resized/0002/5387/25387v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jeremie","last_name":"Abihssira","permalink":"jeremie-abihssira","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CPO","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Herskowitz","permalink":"jason-herskowitz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[49,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/9399/19399v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[49,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/9399/19399v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[49,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/9399/19399v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a
