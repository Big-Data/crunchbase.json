Anyone from an individual to a company or school can create and deliver courses using our tools. Anyone with access to the Web via a computer or mobile device can sign up and take courses.</p>\n\n<p>SpacedEd is powered by a proprietary technology (patent pending) developed at Harvard Medical School that has been proven to significantly increase long-term retention and provide an addictive learning experience. </p>\n\n<p>The SpacedEd approach is predicated on a small set of core principles:\nâ€¢ Short Repeated Bursts: Because it uses a regular schedule and an adaptive algorithm, learning can be delivered in small amounts that can take as little as 1-3 minutes a day.\nâ€¢ Push Learning: The learning comes to you on a regular schedule. You donâ€™t have to remember to do it or set aside large chunks of time.\nâ€¢ Adaptive: The â€œsecret sauceâ€ is a proprietary algorithm that adapts the daily content based on past performance automatically to drive long-term retention while requiring less time.\nâ€¢ Immediate Feedback: Once a question is answered, detailed educational feedback is provided. Users are also given performance data (their course progress and performance relative to peers) which feeds their addiction to the courses.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0005/9179/59179v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0005/9179/59179v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,167],"assets/images/resized/0005/9179/59179v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Duncan","last_name":"Lennox","permalink":"duncan-lennox","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8506/128506v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/8506/128506v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/8506/128506v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Barry","last_name":"Paul","permalink":"barry-paul","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2009/07/22/Harvard-Online-Learning-Technology-Licensed-by-Spaced-Education.aspx","title":"Harvard Online Learning Technology Licensed by Spaced Education"},{"external_url":"http://www.bersin.com/Blog/post/The-Future-(and-History)-of-Learning2c-in-3-Minutes-a-Day.aspx","title":"The Future (and History) of Learning, in 3 Minutes a Day"},{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2009/12/harvard-medicine-elearning-sys.php","title":"Harvard Medical School's Learning Technology Must Be Smart...Right?"},{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2009/12/harvard-medicine-elearning-sys.php","title":"Harvard Medical School's Learning Technology Must Be Smart...Right?"}]}
