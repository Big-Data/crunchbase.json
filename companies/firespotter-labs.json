Of course we&#8217;ve got all the fancy papers and rolling office chairs to make it seem like a company, but at the end of the day we&#8217;re just a room full of crazy people dying to make an impact on people&#8217;s lives. None of us go to &#8220;work&#8221; anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Then what do we do here at the lab? We make things people like. Simple. If people don&#8217;t like what we make we throw it in the ocean and have a good laugh. Then we make something else. We like to build, we love to launch, and if possible we really love to repeat the process. We be nimble. We be quick. And we&#8217;re excited see what sticks.</p>\n\n<p>In our spare time we like to look for massive markets with antiquated and inundated technology. When we find them, we throw in disruptive depth-charges in the form of mobile applications. Between that fancy gadget you carry and our crazy ideas, things are about to become a lot more epic. There&#8217;s a super computer in your pocket and we&#8217;re happy to see it.</p>\n\n<p>Before we get ahead of ourselves, maybe you should write us and say hello. That or come visit the lab and get crushed at ping pong or HALO. Our corporate headquarters has an indoor biking network of dazzling complexity. You should come check it out. Either way it would be more fun than another paragraph.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0013/3274/133274v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0013/3274/133274v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,128],"assets/images/resized/0013/3274/133274v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Software
