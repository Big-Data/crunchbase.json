Lookout&#8217;s unique cross-platform, cloud-connected applications are designed to be lightweight and efficient while delivering the best protection possible. Our Mobile Threat Network scans applications worldwide, allowing us to find and stop threats before they ever become a risk to you so you can rest assured that you&#8217;re protected from the threats that can get between you and your phone, automatically. All in a friendly, easy to use app. Lookout products are available on the Android and iOS phones and tablets.</p>\n\n<p>Lookout was founded by John Hering, James Burgess and Kevin Mahaffey, three mobile security researchers who met at the University of Southern California. The trio&#8217;s early security research led them to conclude that threats to mobile users would grow rapidly and that in order to protect users, a new approach to security will be required. Based on their research, the three founders formed a new kind of security company focused on smartphone protection.</p>\n\n<p>Today Lookout is a rapidly growing company based in San Francisco, California. Lookout is funded by leading investors including Khosla Ventures, Trilogy Equity Partners, Accel Partners and Index Ventures, as well as prominent angel investors such as Joseph Ansanelli, Chris Sacca, Kevin Hartz and Philip Paul.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0007/0887/70887v6-max-150x150.png"],[[238,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/0887/70887v6-max-250x250.png"],[[238,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/0887/70887v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Hering","permalink":"john-hering","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/2513/122513v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[151,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/2513/122513v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,330],"assets/images/resized/0012/2513/122513v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Mahaffey","permalink":"kevin-mahaffey","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP
