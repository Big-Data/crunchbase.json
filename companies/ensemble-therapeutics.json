With their uniquely expansive macrocyclic structure, Ensemblins are a new class of drugs in the emerging therapeutic space between small molecules and biologics. Ensemblins are orally-active therapeutics with unique properties for binding to human disease targets such as Protein:Protein Interaction (PPI) targets, including targets with extended binding domains that are currently only accessible with costly, injectable biologic drugs or currently undruggable intra-cellular targets.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0021/8602/218602v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0021/8602/218602v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[302,74],"assets/images/resized/0021/8602/218602v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"D.
