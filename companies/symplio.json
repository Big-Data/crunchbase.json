One of the main drivers of this vision is the challenge of experimenting the Internet, especially social networks, beyond computing platforms, seamlessly integrated into everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>Internet-connected products exhibit a duality: they are at the same time an object and a set of services. The portion of the product belonging to the physical world, the object, provides direct access to the users&#8217; context and their environment (e.g. wearable sensors). The other portion of the product, the service, empowers users with new ways to use and get value from the object, through Internet-based applications and mash-ups (e.g. data analysis and recommendations).</p>\n\n<p>Symplio strategy is strongly based on user-communities for product co-design, extensions, customizations and for creating additional services, resulting in an open collaboration model.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0013/9398/139398v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0013/9398/139398v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0013/9398/139398v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Rymble, your social Internet object","permalink":"rymble-your-social-internet-object","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Inaki","last_name":"Vazquez","permalink":"inaki-vazquez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technical Director","person":{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Santos","permalink":"roberto-santos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Internet Platform Developer","person":{"first_name":"Alvaro","last_name":"Martin","permalink":"alvaro-martin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"Acosta","permalink":"karina-acosta","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Embedded Platform Developer","person":{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"Goiricelaya","permalink":"juan-goiricelaya","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"DeustoKabi-U.Deusto","address2":"Avda. de las Universidades, 24","zip_code":"48007","city":"Bilbao","state_code":null,"country_code":"ESP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launch of first product concept: Rymble","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":21,"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8589404.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"Symplio Presents Rymble: A Product That Brings Internet Social Networks to the Real World","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Symplio","permalink":"symplio"}},{"description":"Rymble awarded the best Internet of Things Consumer Product of 2011","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":19,"source_url":"http://www.symplio.com/2011/12/rymble-was-chosen-as-the-best-internet-of-things-consumer-product-of-2011/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Rymble was selected as the best Internet of Things \"”Consumer Product\" in 2011.","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Symplio","permalink":"symplio"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tWAryzdOKfU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Rymble by Symplio</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.rymble.com","title":"Rymble, first product by Symplio"}]}
