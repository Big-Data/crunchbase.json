Have you seen promotional deals that focus on impulse buys such as tanning salon, sailboat rides or expensive steakhouse?</p>\n\n<p>RollbackSale (RBS) was formed primarily to benefit consumers and address the market for non-impulse buys for goods and services used frequently. RollbackSale&#8217;s slogan &#8220;Power to the People&#8221; is our mantra to empower consumers to create deals, set prices tied to a minimum commitment, vote on existing promotions and strengthen brand loyalty. Time frames that last up to a year provide value to consumers and strengthen brand loyalty.</p>\n\n<p>RollbackSale is not limited to vendor promotions and may include products and services that consumers are prepared to commit based on a discounted price. Leveraging economies of scale coupled with a more favorable value serve as incentives for consumers to join the cause and make their vote count.  </p>\n\n<p>Consumers vote, manage, track and create deals as well join communities with like minded people. As the number of votes becomes viral, RBS negotiates with manufacturers to honor or come close to the deal. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0011/2372/112372v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[204,100],"assets/images/resized/0011/2372/112372v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[204,100],"assets/images/resized/0011/2372/112372v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder % CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dencie","last_name":"Mascarenas","permalink":"dencie-mascarenas","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Nishank","last_name":"Khanna","permalink":"nishank-khanna","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0392/120392v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,158],"assets/images/resized/0012/0392/120392v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,158],"assets/images/resized/0012/0392/120392v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/eCommerce/rollbacksale-com-where-consumers-set-their-own-prices","title":"RollbackSale.com - Where Consumers Set Their Own Prices"}]}
