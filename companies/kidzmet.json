So, you&#8217;re left to either (a) write off the money you spent on the series of classes or (b) drag your child kicking and screaming to the remaining lessons week after week as her initial interest in the subject dwindles.</p>\n\n<p>But as 21st century parents, the burden is on US to provide well-rounded lives to our children&#8211;especially now that we need to fill the gaps in public school curricula that have been &#8220;left behind&#8221; by state budget cuts. </p>\n\n<p>But between juggling busy careers and hectic family schedules, it&#8217;s tough to find the time to sift through hundreds of local enrichment activities and find the right fit for your family. </p>\n\n<p>Kidzmet profiles will include teacher bios, program and location information that even non-tech-savvy teachers can easily edit.</p>\n\n<p>Revenues will be driven initially by teachers who pay an annual fee to be assessed and recommended to families with children that appear to be compatible with them.</p>\n\n<p>More on the Founder&#8217;s vision for the company here: http://kidzmet.com/content_pages/view/a-cookbook-for-learning</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/0898/90898v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/0898/90898v2-max-250x250.png"],[[281,88],"assets/images/resized/0009/0898/90898v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jen","last_name":"Lilienstein","permalink":"jen-lilienstein","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Santa Barbara","address1":"PO Box 1478","address2":"","zip_code":"93067","city":"Summerland","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0012/8133/128133v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,211],"assets/images/resized/0012/8133/128133v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,380],"assets/images/resized/0012/8133/128133v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/8134/128134v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0012/8134/128134v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0012/8134/128134v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0012/8306/128306v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,211],"assets/images/resized/0012/8306/128306v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,380],"assets/images/resized/0012/8306/128306v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/8307/128307v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0012/8307/128307v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0012/8307/128307v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/8308/128308v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0012/8308/128308v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0012/8308/128308v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/8309/128309v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0012/8309/128309v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0012/8309/128309v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/8310/128310v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0012/8310/128310v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0012/8310/128310v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thesuburbanjungle.blogspot.com/2011/04/kidzmet-helping-kids-discover-right.html","title":"â€œItâ€™s like having a close friend recommend a great piano teacher or swimming coachâ€"},{"external_url":"http://blog.bigiqkids.com/kidzmet-com-provides-a-service-that-is-long-overdue-for-todays-busy-parents/","title":"â€œA service that is long overdue for todayâ€™s busy parentsâ€"},{"external_url":"http://thewahmommyspot.info/2011/03/help-kids-discover-who-theyre-meant-to-become/","title":"â€œI canâ€™t believe how exact this profile was!â€"},{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704198004575310561617944540.html","title":"WSJ"},{"external_url":"http://www.lovemikana.com/?q=Kidzmet","title":"Love Mikana"},{"external_url":"http://www.startupnation.com/leading-moms-in-business/2010-winners","title":"Selected as one of StartUp Nation's Leading Moms in Business"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Search/kidzmet-com-tutors-for-your-children","title":"Killer Startups"},{"external_url":"http://freakyfrugalite.com/kidzmet-banishing-cookie-cutter-tutoring/","title":"â€œKidzmet : Banishing Cookie Cutter Tutoringâ€"},{"external_url":"http://confessionsofanover-workedmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/connect-students-with-teachers-tutors.html","title":"â€œA fantastic service that will definitely save you time & moneyâ€"},{"external_url":"http://startuptunes.com/2011/03/11/kidzmet-find-perfect-teachers-tutors-and-coaches-for-your-kids/","title":""}]}
