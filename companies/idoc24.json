The result has been the development of a mobile medical information service. The user can ask a dermatologist (skin doctor) about any visual medical concern, such as a rash, spots, lesions etc.  A response is given within 24 hours any day of the week in the device that the query was sent, with information of what it could be and how one could treat the problem with over the counter lotions. Today the service is live in Europe through the Apple app store. In Sweden you can also use MMS and a web form. Results so far show that about 70% receive self-care information, and about 30% are advised to see a physician face-to-face, which can prevent &#8220;patients delay&#8221;. Results so far indicate that iDoc24 give a high percentage of correct medical information compared to a family doctor.</p>\n\n<p>The service is accessible through all European Apple app stores.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"BÃ¶rve","permalink":"alexander-brve","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Henrik","last_name":"Agrell","permalink":"henrik-agrell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"HÃ¥kansson","permalink":"peter-hkansson","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Nils","last_name":"MasgÃ¥rd","permalink":"nils-masgrd","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"NHSDirect","permalink":"nhsdirect","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"1177.se","permalink":"1177-se","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Growhouse","address1":"Isafjordsgatan 39B","address2":"","zip_code":"16440","city":"Kista","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/04ThvOTAtLc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/2849/112849v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/2849/112849v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[440,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/2849/112849v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.stockholminnovation.com","title":"Incubator"}]}
