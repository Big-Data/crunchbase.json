The company provides Domain Name portfolio holders with an alternative to domain parking for the very best names in their portfolio. This is done through a combination of website development and monetizing sub-domains (or â€œMarketing Namesâ€) off of the generic website. Examples of marketing names include: Tours.Oahu.com, Luxury.Villa.com, or California.Beef.com.  Leasing sub-domains off a premium domain name will substantially increase the traffic, search engine value (SEO), and inherent value to the overall siteâ€”resulting in sustainable income for Left of the Dot&#8217;s clients.</p>\n\n<p>Not only does the company focus on the client&#8217;s well-being, the results of Left of the Dotâ€™s many projects also benefit the end-consumer. The end-result of LOTD&#8217;s projects results in the development of online industry go-to destinations, an aggregation of quality content, and opportunities for SMEs to get online, get found and conduct business online.</p>\n\n<p>Left of the Dot Media Inc. was established in 2010 and was awarded funding at T.R.A.F.F.I.C.
