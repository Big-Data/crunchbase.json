Dapsâ€™em, and theyâ€™ll know youâ€™re grateful. And not only will they know, but their friends too, as showing off with your daps is a click away. Relationships are based on reciprocity - equal give and take between the two sides. Dapsâ€™em gives you a way to track your deeds, and see what others have done for you. And as youâ€™re collecting daps from others, youâ€™re essentially building up your own street-cred.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0012/9615/129615v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,235],"assets/images/resized/0012/9615/129615v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,423],"assets/images/resized/0012/9615/129615v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4eNEu4GsM8U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Daps&#8217;em  Demo</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/eu/2011/04/05/give-your-friends-a-virtual-fist-bump-with-dapsem-invites/","title":"The Next Web post"},{"external_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2011/04/05/dapsem-is-whuffie-in-an-app-and-it-might-just-work/","title":"TechCrunch post"}]}
