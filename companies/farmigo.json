Purchasing produce directly from the grower is disrupting the traditional supermarket channel by providing fresher, healthier and tastier food. Farmigoâ€™s Internet system enhances this direct grower-to-consumer channel by adding convenience, affordability and accessibility for all households. </p>\n\n<p>Farmigo solves the limitations of both the Farmerâ€™s Market and CSA model by using the advancements of the Internet. On the consumer side, Farmigo provides an online marketplace for consumers to find &amp; join a convenient pick-up location as well as learn about the food and the growers. Consumers are also able to form new buying groups at any convenient location (i.e. office, school, church, and neighborhood). Farms on the Farmigo network gain supply and demand transparency by using the web based system that handles all aspects of order tracking, inventory, packing, distribution, and payment.</p>\n\n<p>Farmigoâ€™s mission is for locally grown healthy, fresh, organic food to be readily accessible to all consumers thereby promoting eco friendly agricultural methods that are environmentally sustainable.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0009/5591/95591v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0009/5591/95591v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,210],"assets/images/resized/0009/5591/95591v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Benzi","last_name":"Ronen","permalink":"benzi-ronen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5443/95443v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[184,221],"assets/images/resized/0009/5443/95443v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[184,221],"assets/images/resized/0009/5443/95443v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Yossi","last_name":"Pik","permalink":"yossi-pik","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6441/96441v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,219],"assets/images/resized/0009/6441/96441v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[166,219],"assets/images/resized/0009/6441/96441v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Hadi","last_name":"Partovi","permalink":"hadi-partovi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/2944/12944v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/2944/12944v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,258],"assets/images/resized/0001/2944/12944v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"R&D Center","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Tel-Aviv","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?deepLinkEmbedCode=BwZm1zMjo6jY6-R80KURMyI7KP12RMXG&height=360&video_pcode=11amo6qGw2oucN78pR-BYbDpCESk&embedCode=BwZm1zMjo6jY6-R80KURMyI7KP12RMXG&width=640\"></script>","description":"<p>Techcrunch Disrupt Finalist</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cy7ig2OsdIY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/2058/132058v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0013/2058/132058v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0013/2058/132058v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
