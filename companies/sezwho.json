This is accomplished through a universal profile widget which provides links to a user&#8217;s contributions across the web.  When a reader views a particular piece of content that they find interesting, the next question they naturally ask is &#8220;who is this person and what else have they contributed?&#8221;  Using the SezWho plugin they can click through to other contributions made by this user whether they&#8217;re blog posts, blog comments, forum contributions, pictures, videos, etc.  The end result is a people based content discovery mechanism for viewers and increased page views for hosting sites. \nSezWho also provides a rating and reputation module which allows viewers to rate content, whereby contributors develop portable, context specific reputations based upon community feedback.  Content can then be filtered and tracked based upon ratings.</p>\n\n<p>SezWho&#8217;s competitors include <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intensedebate\" title=\"Intense Debate\">Intense
