Since developers can spend less time on manual maintenance tasks, software production becomes more cost efficient and products hit the market at faster rates.</p>\n\n<p>As the ever-changing software world continues to develop, software projects are becoming bigger and more complex, homegrown management systems are no longer adequate to support these builds and tests.  Electric Cloud provides companies a simple solution to achieve a scalable, optimal software production environment across an organization.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0004/6402/46402v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0004/6402/46402v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[253,118],"assets/images/resized/0004/6402/46402v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"ElectricCommander","permalink":"electriccommander","image":null},{"name":"ElectricAccelerator","permalink":"electricaccelerator","image":null},{"name":"ElectricInsight","permalink":"electricinsight","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Maciag","permalink":"mike-maciag","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Anders","last_name":"Wallgren","permalink":"anders-wallgren","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chairman of the Board ","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Ousterhout","permalink":"john-ousterhout","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"vice president of business development","person":{"first_name":"Prathap","last_name":"Dendi","permalink":"prathap-dendi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Long","permalink":"ken-long","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BuildForge","permalink":"buildforge","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$9M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.electric-cloud.com/news/2007-0117.php","source_description":"Electric Cloud Secures $9 Million","raised_amount":9000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mayfield Fund","permalink":"mayfield-fund","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/0850/850v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/0850/850v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[217,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/0850/850v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"U.S. Venture Partners","permalink":"u-s-venture-partners-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-150x150.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-250x250.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Rembrandt Venture Partners","permalink":"rembrant-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/9350/29350v5-max-150x150.png"],[[191,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/9350/29350v5-max-250x250.png"],[[191,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/9350/29350v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"RRE Ventures","permalink":"rre-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0002/3486/23486v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/3486/23486v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/3486/23486v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters ","address1":"676 W.
