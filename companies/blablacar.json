It has created a new, affordable and sustainable way to travel, currently used by more than 400,000 passengers every month. BlaBlaCar’s 2.4m-member community offers thousands of destinations across Europe every day. Backed by Accel Partners and ISAI, it operates in nine countries across Europe, and is based in Paris with offices in London, Madrid, Milan and Warsaw.</p>\n\n<p>The site provides a range of features to create a secure, trust-based community and easy connections between drivers and passengers. For instance, members specify how chatty they are on the scale “Bla”, “Blabla” and “Blablabla”, hence the name
