The vision behind Twinity is to forge a close connection between the real and the virtual world. Twinity is building realistic replicas of the worldâ€™s most vibrant cities in 3D, starting with Berlin, with Singapore and London set to follow soon. Twinity members can create a personal avatar, explore real cities virtually, move into a 3D home, chat with friends, work, get creative, or just have fun together. </p>\n\n<p>Twinity also offers businesses new ways of engaging with real people in real virtual cities. Through virtual shops and branded presences, in-world ad campaigns, product placements, and sponsored events, Twinity lets you enter into a direct and emotional, digital dialog with your target group. Twinity is currently in public Beta. Founded in July 2006 and financed by leading venture capital firms, Metaversum has offices in Berlin, Kiev, and Singapore.
