We also are currently regional semifinalists for the Cleantech Open accelerator.</p>\n\n<p>Our three sales channels are direct to owners, through service providers, and as a tool for utilities to provide to their customers.</p>\n\n<p>Craig&#8217;s interests in energy efficiency started in 2006.  After living in China working as an investor and breathing dirty air for 2 years, he decided to focus his career on energy efficiency, renewable energy and making the planet a better place</p>\n\n<p>Since then he received an MBA from Wharton, managed billions of dollars in stimulus funds for the US dept of Energy, and developed commercial building strategies for Johnson Controls, the worlds largest energy efficiency company.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0020/1743/201743v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0020/1743/201743v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,121],"assets/images/resized/0020/1743/201743v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Isakow","permalink":"craig-isakow","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"FirstFuel Software","permalink":"firstfuel-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0017/5658/175658v1-max-150x150.png"],[[228,37],"assets/images/resized/0017/5658/175658v1-max-250x250.png"],[[228,37],"assets/images/resized/0017/5658/175658v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Retroficiency","permalink":"retroficiency","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0012/5645/125645v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0012/5645/125645v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,121],"assets/images/resized/0012/5645/125645v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Johnson Controls","permalink":"johnson-controls-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/6339/56339v1-max-150x150.png"],[[140,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/6339/56339v1-max-250x250.png"],[[140,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/6339/56339v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"WegoWise","permalink":"wegowise","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0019/3479/193479v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0019/3479/193479v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,127],"assets/images/resized/0019/3479/193479v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Serious Energy","permalink":"serious-materials","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/4145/54145v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,69],"assets/images/resized/0005/4145/54145v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[191,69],"assets/images/resized/0005/4145/54145v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$16k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://energy.gov/articles/updated-apps-energy-winners-announced-today","source_description":"Apps for Energy Winners Announced Today!","raised_amount":16000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":22,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"DC Office","address1":"920 U St NW","address2":"","zip_code":"20010","city":"Washington","state_code":"DC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/1239/201239v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/1239/201239v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/1239/201239v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.environmentalleader.com/2012/05/23/winning-app-helps-commercial-buildings-get-energy-star-benchmark/","title":"Environmental Leader - Winning App Helps Commercial Buildings Get Energy Star Benchmark"},{"external_url":"http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/05/why-the-private-sector-likes-white-houses-green-button.php","title":"Why The Private Sector Likes White House’s ‘Green Button’"},{"external_url":"http://inthecapital.com/2012/05/02/dcs-energy-efficiency-startup-melon-joins-white-house-green-button-initiative/","title":"DC’s Energy Efficiency Startup Melon Joins White House ‘Green Button’ Initiative"},{"external_url":"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/green-button-gains-more-believers/","title":"Green Button Gains More Followers"}]}
