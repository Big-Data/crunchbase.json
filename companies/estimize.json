By crowdsourcing estimates and analysis from a diverse set of individuals across the financial landscape, and open sourcing access to the data, Estimize provides a more accurate and representative view of market expectations for the most important fundamental data points. </p>\n\n<p>More Representative Data Sets: While many sell side analysts are paid for corporate access, not accurate and honest analysis, buy side and independent analysts, traders, and investors are free to share a more honest view of their expectations. This produces a more accurate consensus estimate. For earnings releases with 20+ estimates, the Estimize consensus is more accurate than Wall Street 77% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency: Estimize provides transparency to the historically dark institution of whisper numbers by making the history and accuracy of your estimates public. While we do believe in pseudonymity, allowing community members to withhold their identity and affiliation if they so choose, track records are important to building trust within a community. We believe that the accuracy of your analysis is more important than the name on your door.</p>\n\n<p>Community: Since launching into public beta on December 7th, 2011, the Estimize community has grown to over 6,000 members, including members of every major hedge fund, asset management firm, and investment bank. The platform is used by pro and aspiring analysts to create a verifiable track record of estimates and analysis. Estimize consensus estimates and analysts have been cited on several major financial media platforms including TheStreet, Investors Business Daily, Business Week, and Barrons. </p>\n\n<p>B2B Data Company: As the majority of trading becomes quant based, more and more firms are searching for alpha producing data sets. Social finance, including Twitter, StockTwits, Facebook, Wordpress, Estimize, and others will be crucial to providing this alpha as the edge in other data sets has been arbitraged away. We provide a commercial API which allows analysts and traders to incorporate Estimize data directly into their models. Weâ€™ve also formed a partnership with Datasift, allowing anyone to acquire Estimize data in the cloud for sentiment analysis and other purposes. </p>\n\n<p>Leigh Drogen Founder and CEO | Leigh@estimize.com | 914-582-1295 | @LDrogen </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0013/8753/138753v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0013/8753/138753v8-max-250x250.png"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0013/8753/138753v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Leigh","last_name":"Drogen","permalink":"leigh-drogen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Jording","permalink":"matthew-jording","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":31,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Ross","permalink":"rob-ross","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Sullivan","permalink":"todd-sullivan-4","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Bigger","permalink":"michael-bigger","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Carlson","permalink":"jacob-carlson","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/estimize-series-a/","source_description":"Stock Market Prediction Startup Estimize Raises $1.2M Series A","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":11,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Contour Venture Partners","permalink":"contour-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/3464/23464v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[204,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/3464/23464v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[204,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/3464/23464v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Longworth Venture Partners","permalink":"longworth-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7962/17962v1-max-150x150.png"],[[199,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/7962/17962v1-max-250x250.png"],[[199,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/7962/17962v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"WeWork Labs","address1":"175 Varick Street 4th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"10003","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/37624342\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Estimize Introduction</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
