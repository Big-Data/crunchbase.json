We have made the device irrelevant. Are ready for a phone upgrade, lose your device or somehow break it the digital you is safe right where you left it on SnapCrowd.</p>\n\n<p>Here are just a few ways our technology is so disruptive in this space: </p>\n\n<p>Advanced Workflow – 85% of the heavy lifting is done at the data center not by the mobile device.  This will allow our app to work seamlessly from the top end to even the lower end mobile headsets.</p>\n\n<p>Sub User Functionality – This unique feature allows a family or small business to share one cloud account with the main account user(admin)  to assign permissions for each sub. The permissions range from sharing, deleting, uploading, editing and viewing.</p>\n\n<p>Consistent User Experience – We pride ourselves on maintaining a user experience that carries over from OS to OS. From the workflow to the UI our platform puts the users digital files first, at their fingertips ready to come to life – most families will have more than one device and the UI should be consistent.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0018/7721/187721v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0018/7721/187721v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0018/7721/187721v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"McBride","permalink":"john-mcbride","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/7639/177639v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/7639/177639v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[231,266],"assets/images/resized/0017/7639/177639v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"SnapCrowd, Inc","address1":"SnapCrowd, Inc‎ 3424 Robinhood Road","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Winston-Salem","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"248\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cQkvJODaucg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>SnapCrowd Promo Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[78,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/9278/189278v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/9278/189278v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[234,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/9278/189278v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
