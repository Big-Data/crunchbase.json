It offers solutions for thin-film and in-line product wafer measurements based on advanced X-ray reflectivity, X-ray fluorescence, and high resolution X-ray diffractometry technologies. Its X-ray technology enables accurate and precise characterization of films, including single and multi-layer stacks, high k and low k materials, metals and dielectrics, amorphous, poly-crystal, and single crystal films. The companyâ€™s products are used in barrier and seed layers; interconnect metals; strain metrology; hi-k and metal gate; UBM, RDL, and bumps; thin film microstructure; silicides; GMR, MRAM, and HDD; crystalline defect inspection; and front end and back end of line applications. It offers its products for semiconductor manufacturers in the United States and internationally. </p>\n\n<p>Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Inc. was founded in 1982 and is based in Austin, Texas with manufacturing facilities in Migdal Ha&#8217;Emek, Israel; and Durham, the United Kingdom, as well as a research and development center in Migdal Ha&#8217;Emek, Israel. It has sales and customer support offices in Austin, Texas, as well as in Asia and Europe.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0007/7946/77946v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,100],"assets/images/resized/0007/7946/77946v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,100],"assets/images/resized/0007/7946/77946v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$11M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-145029677.html","source_description":"Intel Capital Invests $11 Million in Jordan Valley Semiconductors Limited","raised_amount":11000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Intel Capital","permalink":"intel-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[50,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/3507/13507v6-max-150x150.png"],[[50,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/3507/13507v6-max-250x250.png"],[[50,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/3507/13507v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"8601 Cross Park Drive","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"78754-4578","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0007/7947/77947v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0007/7947/77947v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,352],"assets/images/resized/0007/7947/77947v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
