To optimize deliverability and reach, businesses must connect to multiple mobile carriers, install and operate their own infrastructure, build data analytics and use decades old protocols. Additionally, many third-party SMS solutions require contract and price negotiations, as well as significant up-front costs.</p>\n\n<p>Nexmo eliminates the need to connect to carriers or complex third party protocols through our simple RESTful API. With a scalable infrastructure, we let you push SMS in high volume to over 5 billion users across 200 countries. To increase SMS deliverability and minimize latency, Nexmo uses a direct sourcing model eliminating hops in the chain. That translates to low transaction cost - at wholesale prices - for you.\nWith Nexmo, there is no long-term commitment, minimum spend or negotiation required - just plain and simple pay-as-you-go!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0015/9818/159818v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0015/9818/159818v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0015/9818/159818v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Wholesale SMS API","permalink":"wholesale-sms-api","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Jamous","permalink":"tony-jamous","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Nadalin","permalink":"eric-nadalin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development Director","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Economon","permalink":"alex-economon","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Customer Loyalty","person":{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"CorazÃ³n","permalink":"alberto-corazn","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Architect","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Cook","permalink":"paul-cook-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director Carriers Relations","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Vigar","permalink":"david-vigar","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"Galvan","permalink":"teresa-galvan","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"UK Office","address1":"850 Kestrel","address2":"2 St George Wharf","zip_code":"SW82AZ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"US HQ","address1":"2711 Centerville Road","address2":"","zip_code":"19808","city":"Wilmington","state_code":"DE","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0015/0711/150711v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0015/0711/150711v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,238],"assets/images/resized/0015/0711/150711v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
