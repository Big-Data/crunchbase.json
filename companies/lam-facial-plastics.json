The goal of every surgical endeavor is to achieve the best result without the perceptible stigma of having had surgery. When a prospective patient is seeking aesthetic consultation, he or she should diligently review the surgeonâ€™s before-and-after results to determine whether that goal is met. Speaking with other patients who have been satisfied with the surgeonâ€™s results can also provide useful information about the recovery period and their satisfaction with the care provided and ultimately the aesthetic outcome. Understanding the surgeonâ€™s philosophy and surgical technique must also be a preliminary step toward establishing trust and determining whether surgical goals are mutual. Accordingly, Dr. Lam has set forth the following goals for every patient encounter and surgical enterprise:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To provide the best aesthetic and/or functional outcome.</li>\n<li>To achieve only a natural, non-operated appearing surgical result.</li>\n<li>To tailor every surgical endeavor to the patientâ€™s anatomy and desires.</li>\n<li>To achieve the fastest, least painful recovery possible.</li>\n<li>To use the latest, most advanced, but proven techniques to arrive at these goals.</li>\n<li>To offer the patient different options that conform to his or her aesthetic wishes, budgetary constraints, and time commitment to recovery.</li>\n<li>To educate the patient about these options in order to promote fruitful dialogue that allows the patient to make an intelligent decision as to his or her own care.</li>\n<li>To assist the patient in reliable and suitable methods to ensure longevity of the surgical result.</li>\n<li>To handle any question, problem, or concern promptly and fully.\n<ol>\n<li>To extend the best care that can be provided to the patient during every phase from the preoperative, operative, to postoperative setting.</li>\n<li>Not to stop until all of these goals are met.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner / M.D.","person":{"first_name":"Dr. Sam","last_name":"Lam","permalink":"dr-sam-lam","image":{"available_sizes":[[[78,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8412/98412v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[131,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8412/98412v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[236,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/8412/98412v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Lam Facial Plastics","address1":"6101 Chapel Hill Blvd ","address2":"Ste.101","zip_code":"75093","city":"Plano","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
