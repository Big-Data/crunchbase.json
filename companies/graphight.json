Then through a set of APIs, Rexter monitors the user&#8217;s relationship-building activities across multiple calendars, inboxes, social networks, and smart phone platforms.  </p>\n\n<p>While Rexter is monitoring the user&#8217;s networking efforts, its engine is analyzing the activities so it can score the relative relationship value of them.  By knowing about the user&#8217;s network and monitoring their relationship building activities, Rexter is able to produce a personalized recommendation of the most effective use of time spent networking.  </p>\n\n<p>The recommendations are then presented to the user in the manner he/she chose (email notifications, direct logins to Rexter) so that they have a daily list of relevant people to contact in order to best stoke their professional network.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0013/9183/139183v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0013/9183/139183v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,161],"assets/images/resized/0013/9183/139183v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Wilson","permalink":"andy-wilson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5498/155498v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5498/155498v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/5498/155498v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Bouganim","permalink":"daniel-bouganim","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"Sagar","permalink":"nancy-sagar-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Lee","permalink":"jay-lee-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operations Manager","person":{"first_name":"Katie","last_name":"Cameron","permalink":"katie-cameron","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0021/7818/217818v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0021/7818/217818v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0021/7818/217818v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Product","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Slade","permalink":"john-slade-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9212/139212v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/9212/139212v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/9212/139212v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"Sagar","permalink":"nancy-sagar","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Gil","last_name":"Elbaz","permalink":"gil-elbaz-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Jarl","last_name":"Mohn","permalink":"jarl-mohn-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Ted","last_name":"Meisel","permalink":"ted-meisel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0007/3905/73905v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0007/3905/73905v2-max-250x250.png"],[[406,120],"assets/images/resized/0007/3905/73905v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Elevation Partners</p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Tapin","permalink":"todd-tapin","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Momentum Venture Management ","permalink":"momentum-venture-management","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/6001/36001v1-max-150x150.png"],[[233,92],"assets/images/resized/0003/6001/36001v1-max-250x250.png"],[[233,92],"assets/images/resized/0003/6001/36001v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Moriarty","permalink":"sean-moriarty","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/3252/73252v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,239],"assets/images/resized/0007/3252/73252v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,239],"assets/images/resized/0007/3252/73252v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://2008.sxsw.com/music/conference/panels_schedule/?action=bio&amp;id=65202\" title=\"SXSW\" rel=\"nofollow\">SXSW</a></p>"}}}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":400000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Kamran","last_name":"Pourzanjani","permalink":"kamran-pourzanjani","image":null}},{"company":{"name":"Siemer Ventures","permalink":"siemer-ventures","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"2400 N.
