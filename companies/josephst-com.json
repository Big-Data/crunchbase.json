It has been created with the casual web user in mind that isn&#8217;t into joining the &#8216;Google era&#8217; and would much rather find than search in an enjoyable environment. </p>\n\n<p>Users can search for what they are looking for and instead of traditional text as a search return, they will find buildings (called storefronts) containing logos as well as a direct link to what they are looking for on the storefront itself. </p>\n\n<p>For less than 31Â¢ a day, customers (businesses) receive a storefront with their own logo as well as a direct link to their site viewable by either opening a new window or via the mini-browser of the site. The benefit to the customer comes in the form of upcoming regional and national radio and television advertising as well as sponsored events. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever a user is able to find the site, it increases the chances of them not only finding the site of the businesses featured, but experiencing a truly intuitive and elegant way of doing so. </p>\n\n<p>In order to rent a storefront, businesses can visit the site and take a look at the terms of use, media kit, how to use, and join the site by clicking on the rent a storefront link located on the bottom of the homepage. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/7400/27400v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/7400/27400v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/7400/27400v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"JosephSt Directory","permalink":"josephst-directory","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Gonzalez","permalink":"joseph-gonzalez","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"rebecca-smith","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/7329/27329v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0002/7329/27329v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0002/7329/27329v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/blog/walking-down-joseph-street-part-i/","title":"Killerstartups Article 1"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/blog/walking-down-joseph-street-part-ii/","title":"Killerstartups Article 2"}]}
