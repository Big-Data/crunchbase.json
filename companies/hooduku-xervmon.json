Thus, even as cloud adoption is inevitable in business, Xervmon can play a crucial role in ensuring that you manage the budget to do it right. </p>\n\n<p>From this ability springs the following features:\n• It provides businesses spend trends across multiple service providers\n• It presents cost saving opportunities, predictive analyses and cost/usage information\n• It uses proprietary applets CloudSpend™ and  SpendTrend™ to run analysis on IT spend data\n• It consolidates and integrates IT spend data in easily exportable formats using Big Data techniques\n• It integrates seamlessly with existing dashboard software like      SharePoint and Alfresco\nAll this makes reconciliation of actual spend with budget considerably easier. Therefore, with Xervmon running, the marriage between budget and spend is no longer on the rocks; the state of the union is stronger than ever before.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0020/7899/207899v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0020/7899/207899v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0020/7899/207899v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Babu","last_name":"Jayaram","permalink":"babu-jayaram","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Sudhi","last_name":"Sheshachala","permalink":"sudhi-sheshachala","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Strategy Officer","person":{"first_name":"Shesh","last_name":"Vasudevamurthy","permalink":"shesh-vasudevamurthy","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"kiran","last_name":"Kulkarni","permalink":"kiran-kulkarni","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Nandakumar","last_name":"Chowdappa","permalink":"nandakumar-chowdappa","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corp.
