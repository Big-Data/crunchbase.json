Added to this, our self-healing algorithm allows dynamic database movement within and across clouds. It automatically updates data on any failed node before allowing it back into a cluster, reducing administrative overhead.</p>\n\n<p>GenieDB was specifically designed to enhance the benefits and overcome the challenges of scaling web applications in any environment. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0006/9771/69771v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0006/9771/69771v2-max-250x250.png"],[[265,84],"assets/images/resized/0006/9771/69771v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dr","last_name":"Jack Kreindler","permalink":"dr-jack-kreindler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Cedric","last_name":"Sellin","permalink":"cedric-sellin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[94,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/9893/19893v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[94,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/9893/19893v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[94,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/9893/19893v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://dncapital.com/inv_team.cfm\" title=\"DN Capital\" rel=\"nofollow\">DN Capital</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Rainey","permalink":"john-rainey","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Alaric","last_name":"Snell-Pym","permalink":"alaric-snell-pym","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8537/98537v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8537/98537v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,280],"assets/images/resized/0009/8537/98537v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"Â£250k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"BWCI Trust","permalink":"bwci-trust","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"Unit 3 - 4 Orchard Mews","address2":"42 Orchard Road","zip_code":"N6 5TR","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
