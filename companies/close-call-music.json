Firstly working with Abbey Road Live, an EMI Music company, Close Call is developing a wireless network and mobile website to provide m-commerce to the Abbey Road Live brand.  Abbey Road Live currently provides Live CDs and downloads (via USBs or their own website) within minutes of the live event finishing.  </p>\n\n<p>Close Call&#8217;s system will allow consumers to purchase the live performance of the event from within the venue, real-time live track updates, sample tracks and integration into social networking. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Close Call has a vision to produce a new, visual graphic interface, media player to cross multiple hardware platforms and help the consumer consolidate their digital media catalogue.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
