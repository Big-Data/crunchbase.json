Our users get personalized recommendations for a range of formal and informal education opportunities, from pre-schools to grad schools, from local tutors to study abroad programs, from fine arts to fitness, and more &#8211; all while leveraging our users&#8217; social graphs.</p>\n\n<p>By collecting the best available data about education providers and creating sophisticated, engaging social search and recommendation engines to help users make sense of it all, Noodle has created a virtuous circle of participation by consumers of educational services, providers of educational services, and suppliers of educational information.</p>\n\n<p>Over 170,000 learning institutions are featured on Noodle with more being added every day.</p>\n\n<p>Check us
