Tgethr allows people to write to one email address instead of a group, increase email security, image thumbnail support, CC: and BCC: a group, among other things. </p>\n\n<p>Tgethr is a subsidiary of <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/inkling\" title=\"Inkling\">Inkling</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tgethr provides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Provides a single email address for your group: groupname@tgethr.com.  Anyone in the group can email that address and the whole group gets a copy and can reply from their email clients or on the web.  (Admit it, often we are too lazy to type in the 5 or so email addresses of our immediate family to share even mundane news they would actually love to hear about. I know I am.) </p></li>\n<li><p>Super simple for group members.  They donâ€™t have to worry about yet another account on yet another web application.  People can continue to use their email clients without ever signing up online.  </p></li>\n<li><p>A web interface + archive of the discussion (without all the repetition). Everyone gets SSL. </p></li>\n<li><p>Email encryption!  The groupâ€™s messages can be encrypted both ways, and we centrally store the group members public certificates to make the email encryption setup much easier for the group.</p></li>\n<li><p>Links to centrally stored files so the same file attachment isnâ€™t sitting in umpteen inboxes.</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone interface.  iPhone doesnâ€™t support encrypted email but we made it easy to get both encrypted and unencrypted mail from your phone.</p></li>\n<li><p>Super simple CRM.  BCC or forward messages to/from non-group members (vendors, clients, etc.) and have those discussions shared and searchable by the rest of your group.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/8892/48892v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/8892/48892v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/8892/48892v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":null,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/8894/48894v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0004/8894/48894v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,377],"assets/images/resized/0004/8894/48894v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
