Much like the music industry before it and accustom to being in the driverâ€™s seat for decades, these organizations are struggling with how to change their approach to users while maintaining revenues.  Drund exists to relieve this pressure.   </p>\n\n<p>By sitting directly in-between these parties with its user-centric and agnostic platform, Drund allows users to control the experience while giving telcos, cable and content providers a scalable revenue model through a customizable â€œstore front.â€  The additional incremental revenue across hundreds of thousands of users will fuel network improvements and avoid net neutrality hurdles since the user is ultimately in control of their applications, advertising exposure and content consumption on their terms.</p>\n\n<p>Drundâ€™s application controls, data management and video distribution technologies allows consumers to access their content and services on any device without the need to network or sync personal settings. Developers can take advantage of Drundâ€™s open API to shorten cycles and simplify development challenges so applications can be created once and used across any consumer device or platform.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/4320/124320v4-max-150x150.png"],[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/4320/124320v4-max-250x250.png"],[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/4320/124320v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Graphic Designer","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Andrew","permalink":"stephen-andrew","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Developer","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Helmick","permalink":"mike-helmick","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Developer","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Krpicak","permalink":"kevin-krpicak","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Robenolt","permalink":"matt-robenolt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Yi","permalink":"lee-yi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Nayef","last_name":"Zarrour","permalink":"nayef-zarrour","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Lead Developer","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Serra","permalink":"nick-serra","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Shank","permalink":"josh-shank","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Developer","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Magana","permalink":"adam-magana","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Graphic Designer","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Hallas","permalink":"robert-hallas","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Public Relations","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"SHIFT Communications","permalink":"shift-communications","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"945 Boardman Canfield Road","address2":"Suite 3","zip_code":"44512","city":"Boardman","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/4318/124318v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0012/4318/124318v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,377],"assets/images/resized/0012/4318/124318v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0012/4319/124319v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0012/4319/124319v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0012/4319/124319v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5316/125316v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5316/125316v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[344,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/5316/125316v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://media.www.thejambar.com/media/storage/paper324/news/2010/11/16/Drund/your-Life.Simplified-3959361.shtml","title":"Your Life, Simplified"},{"external_url":"http://blogs.forbes.com/michaelhumphrey/2011/02/22/hulu-meet-twitter-drund-tries-to-take-your-desktop-to-the-cloud/","title":"Hulu, Meet Twitter: Drund Tries to Take Your Desktop to the Cloud"},{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2011/03/01/drund/","title":"Drund Gives Devs & Users All-in-One Tool for Connected Devices"}]}
