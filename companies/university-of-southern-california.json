USC enrolls more international students than any other U.S. university and offers extensive opportunities for internships and study abroad. With a strong tradition of integrating liberal and professional education, USC fosters a vibrant culture of public service and encourages students to cross academic as well as geographic boundaries in their pursuit of knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>Established: 1880 </p>\n\n<p>Los Angeles was little more than a frontier town in 1880 when USC first opened its doors to 53 students and 10 teachers. Today it is a world-class research university, the oldest private research university in the West. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/6122/66122v1-max-150x150.png"],[[73,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/6122/66122v1-max-250x250.png"],[[73,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/6122/66122v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Part-Time Faculty Member","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Nazar","permalink":"adam-nazar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Professor & Academic Director of the Marshall School of Business Global EMBA","person":{"first_name":"Baizhu","last_name":"Chen","permalink":"baizhu-chen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4605/134605v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/4605/134605v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/4605/134605v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Programmer Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Rocher","permalink":"scott-rocher","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1598/51598v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[205,205],"assets/images/resized/0005/1598/51598v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[205,205],"assets/images/resized/0005/1598/51598v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":26,"company":{"name":"Where My Dogs At","permalink":"where-my-dogs-at","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7564/197564v2-max-150x150.png"],[[239,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7564/197564v2-max-250x250.png"],[[430,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/7564/197564v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"University Park Campus","address2":"","zip_code":"90089","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/goRrgczKagI%2Em4v\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"240\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2010/03/the-business-of-television-is-going-to-explode-in-growth-over-the-next-several-years-thanks-to-online-video-thats-the-conclu.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a> </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0006/6123/66123v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0006/6123/66123v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,334],"assets/images/resized/0006/6123/66123v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://usccareers.usc.edu/","title":"Faculty and Teaching Jobs"}]}
