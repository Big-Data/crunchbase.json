Metwit APIs allow developers to create geolocalized applications capable of receiving and publishing diffused, real time environmental data with a strong social connotation.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0022/1692/221692v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,126],"assets/images/resized/0022/1692/221692v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,227],"assets/images/resized/0022/1692/221692v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Ruini","permalink":"michele-ruini-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"wunderground","permalink":"wunderground","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$25k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://thenextweb.com/me/2012/01/29/meet-the-first-three-startups-from-the-middle-east-incubator-seedstartups-pilot-program/","source_description":"Meet the first three startups from the Middle East incubator ‘SeedStartup’s’ pilot program","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":30,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Seedstartup","permalink":"seedstartup","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Company address","address1":"471 FINCHLEY ROAD","address2":"","zip_code":"NW3 6HS ","city":"LONDON","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0022/1066/221066v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0022/1066/221066v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0022/1066/221066v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://betakit.com/2012/10/20/apps-taking-a-crowdsourced-approach-to-reporting-the-weather","title":"Betakit on Crowdsourced weather"}]}
