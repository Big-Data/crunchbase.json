This young team put their efforts into a unique project: to launch an online backup platform.</p>\n\n<p>The result has become more than just a virtual storage space for files. Yuntaa is an efficient, user friendly and democratic website. Users not only get access to personalised webspace, they can also manage and share their files online with other Internet users. In the meantime, Yuntaa members now form a tight-knit Internet community.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Yuntaa is following new developments closely. New tools are offered regularly. We are currently working hard on a business version, Yuntaa.biz. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1138/21138v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/1138/21138v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[282,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/1138/21138v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and founder","person":{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Lambrechts","permalink":"jan-lambrechts","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Barrett","permalink":"andy-barrett","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Nadia","last_name":"Lambrechts","permalink":"nadia-lambrechts","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Luc","last_name":"Devos","permalink":"luc-devos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Vanhoyweghen","permalink":"jan-vanhoyweghen","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Mosso","permalink":"mosso","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/1019/21019v1-max-150x150.png"],[[179,59],"assets/images/resized/0002/1019/21019v1-max-250x250.png"],[[179,59],"assets/images/resized/0002/1019/21019v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"drop.io","permalink":"drop-io","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/2401/2401v1-max-150x150.png"],[[126,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/2401/2401v1-max-250x250.png"],[[126,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/2401/2401v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Box","permalink":"box","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0000/3484/3484v3-max-150x150.png"],[[197,116],"assets/images/resized/0000/3484/3484v3-max-250x250.png"],[[197,116],"assets/images/resized/0000/3484/3484v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.digimedia.be/digipf.asp?Id=5503","source_description":"VC-fonds Arkafund pompt 1 miljoen euro in Belgische Web 2.0 start-up","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Arkafund","permalink":"arkafund","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Yuntaa Brussels","address1":"Gossetlaan 30","address2":"","zip_code":"1702 ","city":"Groot-Bijgaarden","state_code":null,"country_code":"BEL","latitude":50.8726449,"longitude":4.276811}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
