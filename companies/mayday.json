With this reliance on user feedback, companies are losing revenue to competitors without even realising. Our cloud-based solution enables us to become the customers&#8217; voice. By flagging up errors as they occur, we empower companies to be proactive, allowing them to fix issues before they impact the entire user base - and before users even have chance to complain. </p>\n\n<p>Our aim is to have a huge impact on how companies approach software development\\testing, how they identify which areas of their site to improve and how they target the errors that are costing them money. </p>\n\n<p>More information can be found at http://www.maydayhq.com/</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0014/6133/146133v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0014/6133/146133v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0014/6133/146133v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2011/07/29/mayday-alerts-about-problems-across-all-browsers-and-tells-you-why-springboard/","title":"Mayday alerts about problems across all browsers and tells you why [Springboard]"}]}
