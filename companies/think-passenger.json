Customers/\r\n\r\n*LOS ANGELES, November 24, 2008 â€”* Passenger\r\n, the technology leader in on-demand\r\nCustomer Collaboration, today announced record-breaking sales results\r\nfor its fiscal third quarter ending on Tuesday, Sept. 30. Passenger\r\nachieved bookings growth of 217 percent over its second fiscal quarter,\r\nand year over year growth of 692 percent, surpassing company forecasts.\r\nMany of the most iconic brands in the world use Passengerâ€™s intuitive\r\nsoftware-as-a-service platform and professional services to infuse the\r\nvoice of the customer\r\ninto their businesses.\r\n\r\nNew Passenger customers are global leaders in their respective\r\ncategories, including:\r\n\r\n* One of the top two online broadcast networks in the world\r\n* A multi-billion dollar shipping and logistics services company\r\n* A top automotive manufacturer\r\n* A global leader in the beverage industry\r\n* An American cable TV network\r\n* A luxury lifestyle brand\r\n\r\nIn addition, Passenger renewed accounts with several large brands in the\r\nautomotive, retail, media and entertainment industries. Customer\r\nretention for the quarter and all previous quarters since the Company\r\nwas founded in 2005 remains 100 percent. Passenger attributes its high\r\ncustomer retention and revenue growth during the softening economy to\r\nthe fact that brands value direct access and dialog with customers to\r\nshape products, marketing programs and advertising campaigns. This\r\ninsight enables Passengerâ€™s clients to spend less on the planning and\r\nexecution of costly marketing initiatives and in designing new products.\r\n\r\n\"We saw strong customer traction in Q3, winning new accounts and\r\nexpanding existing ones with some of the worldâ€™s top consumer, media and\r\nfashion brands,\" said Justin Cooper, co-founder and chief innovation +\r\nmarketing officer, Passenger. \"We attribute Passengerâ€™s continued\r\nsuccess to the real business value these brands are realizing from our\r\nunique blend of collaboration technology and community management\r\nservices. â€˜Communityâ€™ is a broadly interpreted term in the industry, but\r\nPassengerâ€™s proven approach is explicitly geared towards helping our\r\nclients co-innovate with their customers in the areas of marketing,\r\nbranding and product development.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to record-breaking customer momentum, Passenger expanded its\r\nmanagement team with the appointment of Samantha Skey to senior vice\r\npresident of business development and general manager of the eastern\r\nregion. Samantha joined Passenger from Alloy Media + Marketing, one of\r\nthe country's largest providers of nontraditional media programs, where\r\nshe served as executive vice president, strategic marketing. To carry on\r\nthis momentum, Passenger will be announcing other senior level\r\nappointments in the near future, aimed at capitalizing on growth\r\nopportunities within the channel and internationally.","source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Passenger","permalink":"think-passenger"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0005/9244/59244v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0005/9244/59244v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,239],"assets/images/resized/0005/9244/59244v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0007/9434/79434v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,190],"assets/images/resized/0007/9434/79434v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,343],"assets/images/resized/0007/9434/79434v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0015/8758/158758v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0015/8758/158758v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,308],"assets/images/resized/0015/8758/158758v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0015/8759/158759v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0015/8759/158759v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,308],"assets/images/resized/0015/8759/158759v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0015/8760/158760v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0015/8760/158760v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,394],"assets/images/resized/0015/8760/158760v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.jackmyers.com/commentary/media-business-report/12558121.html","title":"Brands in a Socially Networked World: \"Passenger\" Outline Rules for Navigation"}]}
