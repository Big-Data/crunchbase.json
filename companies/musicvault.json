In addition to both digital and physical media and new &amp; secondary tickets, musicVault brings together material ranging from lyrics to sheet music, books to posters and famously even Amy Winehouse wigs - where possible. </p>\n\n<p>A key feature of musicVault is its range of recommended material which sets it apart from others in the market, who at the time tended to concentrate simply on music, video and new tickets.</p>\n\n<p>James Thomson founded the company after having the original idea and in September 2008 brought together a team including Marc Moderegger - an Australian Project Manager working in Canary Wharf, Eric Wright a U.S Software Engineer and the Non-Exec Board Advisors including Dr Jeremy Silver, Grant Calton and Nathan Graves. </p>\n\n<p>They had the initial intention of creating a stand alone desktop application which users would download from recording artists albums and DVDâ€™s, until they realised the required funding was unobtainable without a proof of concept. The iTunes plugin is actually the fourth app conceived by James, after 2 desktop and a mobile version along similar lines and although initially the plugin was meant to simply be that proof of concept which could be built with no funding - the team quickly realised the concept allowed for much greater development.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,140],"assets/images/resized/0012/2587/122587v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,140],"assets/images/resized/0012/2587/122587v2-max-250x250.png"],[[140,140],"assets/images/resized/0012/2587/122587v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder CEO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Thomson","permalink":"james-thomson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0012/2722/122722v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,230],"assets/images/resized/0012/2722/122722v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,415],"assets/images/resized/0012/2722/122722v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Moderegger","permalink":"marc-moderegger","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Non-Executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Grant","last_name":"Calton","permalink":"grant-calton","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Technology","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Wright","permalink":"eric-wright","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Non-Executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"Graves","permalink":"nathan-graves","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Non-Executive Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Silver","permalink":"jeremy-silver","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Thomson","permalink":"james-thomson-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Creative Director","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Thomson","permalink":"robert-thomson-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Aylmer House","address2":"Eastney Street, Greenwich","zip_code":"SE10 9NU","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0012/2586/122586v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0012/2586/122586v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,272],"assets/images/resized/0012/2586/122586v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
