Insights are displayed graphically through powerful, easy-to-use dashboards thereby democratizing decision-making across the enterprise and into the extended enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>Built from the ground up for a data-rich economy and to reduce the economic and technology risk associated with deploying a traditional business intelligence solution, Guavus Big Data analytics  solutions include a complete platform integrated with a suite of decisioning applications.
