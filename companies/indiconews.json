The aim of the site is to create a greater sense of identity within the news process where the audience is no longer passive but part of an ongoing conversation. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.indiconews.com\" title=\"Indiconews.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indiconews.com</a> does this by not only enabling users to upload reports/comments/eyewitness updates according to location and category as text, multi-images and video, but also via a range of innovative features, including:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.indiconews.com/assignment/view_all_assignments\" title=\"Assignments:\" rel=\"nofollow\">Assignments:</a>: Indiconews.com users set assignments according to what they define as newsworthy. Other members can then take up the assignment, providing a range of views and news perspectives associated with the topic. This creates an immediate, yet deeper &#8216;discussion&#8217;, challenging one-dimensional news or issue reportage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.indiconews.com\" title=\"Tip-off\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tip-off</a>: A more focused assignment feature, &#8220;Tip-off&#8221; allows the local user to assign specific members within their locality to report anything from a music festival to a political rally. This helps build hyper-local news while drawing on civic media reporters local knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.indiconews.com/interview/search_interviewee\" title=\"&#8220;Interview Me&#8221;\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;Interview Me&#8221;</a>: A feature that matches reporter&#8217;s interview needs with registered indiconews &#8216;experts&#8217;. It is a mutually beneficial system - reporters get relevant information, from source, while the &#8216;interviewed&#8217; get coverage in the news. Authenticity of interviewee&#8217;s expertise is based on supporting information provided by the &#8216;expert&#8217; from which the reporter can evaluate their relevance for their news feature.</p>\n\n<p>Since rolling out public Beta V2 in March 09, Indiconews.com has been added to <a href=\"http://civic.mit.edu/projects/community/indiconewscom\" title=\"MIT&#8217;s Center for Future Civic Media\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIT&#8217;s Center for Future Civic Media</a> network of civic media innovators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Standards in Civic Media Series</strong>\nIndiconews.com have also launched their <a href=\"http://www.indiconews.com/article/view/113\" title=\"&#8220;Standards in Civic Media&#8221;\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;Standards in Civic Media&#8221;</a> series. </p>\n\n<p>This is an ongoing project that will examine the need, if any, for a &#8216;code of conduct&#8217; for civic media sites. </p>\n\n<p>They plan to draw on the insight, opinions and expertise of industry insiders, academics, journalists and of course the community of civic media users. </p>\n\n<p>It is hoped that the collaborative piece of work (competitors and partners alike are encouraged to engage with it) will eventually find a home of it&#8217;s own, independent of Indiconews.com - most likely as a wiki-style resource. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever the findings, indiconews.com hope the &#8220;Standards in Civic Media&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.indiconews.com/article/view/113\" title=\"&#8220;Standards in Civic Media&#8221;\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;Standards in Civic Media&#8221;</a> series will produce some very interesting contributions which will shape civic media&#8217;s future during its development.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0004/2423/42423v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,99],"assets/images/resized/0004/2423/42423v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,178],"assets/images/resized/0004/2423/42423v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"indiconews.com","permalink":"indiconews-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Hodgson","permalink":"elizabeth-hodgson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Canterbury","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.2772689,"longitude":1.0805173}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/2422/42422v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0004/2422/42422v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,352],"assets/images/resized/0004/2422/42422v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://civic.mit.edu/projects/community/indiconewscom","title":"MIT Center for Future Civic Media"}]}
