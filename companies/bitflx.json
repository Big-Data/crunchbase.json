And all the while, augmenting the capabilities of the user&#8217;s current social networks (like Facebook) to extend the reach of their content to their larger groups of friends.</p>\n\n<p>BitFlx is focused on the neighborhood and communities to create better and more interesting connections.  Videos can be used to document events and activities from any location. Businesses can interact with BitFlx users through localized video content (commercial sites are given a special mention in the BitFlx interface). Organizations can crowd-source content, asking members for contributions that can be tagged according to time and place. Local users can leverage the &#8220;digital bulletin&#8221; board to alert neighbors, post garage sales, and share what they see.</p>\n\n<p>And while there are applications for â€œcitizen journalistsâ€ which allow users to broadcast live from an iPhone, these apps donâ€™t concentrate much on the social aspect of real-time broadcasts.  BitFlx provides a real time access to content thats relevant and current, creating a &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; approach to sharing and connecting with content with the community around them, wherever they may find themselves.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/8601/148601v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0014/8601/148601v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,114],"assets/images/resized/0014/8601/148601v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO - Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"Andreatta","permalink":"sebastian-andreatta-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO - Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Geschwind","permalink":"gary-geschwind","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/8599/148599v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/8599/148599v2-max-250x250.png"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/8599/148599v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/8600/148600v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/8600/148600v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/8600/148600v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
