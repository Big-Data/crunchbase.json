Main Street Stark plans to launch a dozen new operations in the first half of 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Main Street Stark will have both a physical presence in the community as well as a virtual storefront on the internet. Mentors from Stark County as well as the rest of the USA will nurture individuals wanting to partner with seasoned business veterans from the private sector. According to Jeff &#8216;SKI&#8217; Kinsey, Entrepreneur in Residence, â€œLocal job creation is a natural side effect of small business formation â€˜done right and done wellâ€™ under the tutelage of like minded individuals.â€</p>\n\n<p>The Main Street Stark web site includes a wealth of startup business articles and links, including an â€œapplyâ€ button to start a dialog. Local and national contributors have been sought out to add value to the site. Other services are planned after the first of the year. â€œSupport and enthusiasm among the local business community has been outstanding,â€ says Kinsey, adding, â€œPaying it forward, or paying oneâ€™s civic rent, is a tradition long observed in Stark County. I am pleased to play a small role in taking it to the next level.â€</p>\n\n<p>During his career &#8216;SKI&#8217; has helped businesses generate millions of dollars in revenue over the internet. After more than ten years of IT/IS consulting, he went back to school to hone his expertise in the areas of process improvement methodologies such as Demingâ€™s Total Quality Management (TQM) and Constraints Management Model (CMM). He is also the author of Purple Curve Effect (Throughput Press, copyright 2004), has owned or created more than ten small business, owned a national franchise, and played a major role in three separate leveraged buy-outs (LBOs). However, Kinsey is quick to point out that his career path actually started with 90 days of intense mentoring in San Diego, CA with the ultimate incubator: the United States Marine Corps.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/4567/114567v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0011/4567/114567v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0011/4567/114567v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Entrepreneur in Residence","person":{"first_name":"Jeff SKI","last_name":"Kinsey","permalink":"jeff-kinsey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-150x150.png"],[[210,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-250x250.png"],[[262,311],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Jeff &#8216;SKI&#8217; Kinsey / <a href=\"http://mainststark.com\" title=\"Main Street Stark\" rel=\"nofollow\">Main Street Stark</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://mainststark.blogspot.com/2010/11/accelerated-virtual-biz-development-in.html","source_description":"Main Street Stark Biz Incubator Launched","raised_amount":1000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Jeff SKI","last_name":"Kinsey","permalink":"jeff-kinsey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-150x150.png"],[[210,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-250x250.png"],[[262,311],"assets/images/resized/0007/5176/75176v15-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Jeff &#8216;SKI&#8217; Kinsey / <a href=\"http://mainststark.com\" title=\"Main Street Stark\" rel=\"nofollow\">Main Street Stark</a></p>"}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Mailing Address","address1":"1240 Lincoln Way","address2":"Suite 134","zip_code":"44646","city":"Massillon","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Office/Workspaces","address1":"4268 Erie Avenue SW","address2":"Suite B","zip_code":"44662","city":"Massillon","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0011/4566/114566v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0011/4566/114566v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,379],"assets/images/resized/0011/4566/114566v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0012/1911/121911v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0012/1911/121911v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0012/1911/121911v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mainststark.com/community","title":"Sponsored Events"},{"external_url":"http://mainststark.com/apply/","title":"Entrepreneurs: Open a Dialog"}]}
