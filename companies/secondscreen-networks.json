SecondScreen sells and serves digital ads, synchronized in real time with TV spots, enabling marketers to complement their TV buys and more directly engage the viewing audience.</p>\n\n<p>&#8216;Second screen&#8217; usage on laptops, tablets and smartphones has been increasing dramatically among TV viewers.  And such usage is exploding especially around major “water cooler” events, which drive significant amounts of online conversation.  During programming and in particular during commercial breaks, viewer attention and activity is moving to the growing array of &#8216;social TV&#8217; websites and applications.</p>\n\n<p>SecondScreen Networks is creating the first ad platform for the two screen future of TV.  Our proprietary technology allows advertising experiences on handheld &#8216;Second Screen&#8217; devices to match TV ads in real time.  For example, when a 30 second Kraft spot appears on your TV screen during a show, a complementary, and interactive Kraft digital ad can appear on the tablet in your lap.  Such synchronized ads provide a highly effective and measurable channel for TV advertisers to complement their existing TV spots. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/3509/213509v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/3509/213509v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/3509/213509v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Sync Ads","permalink":"sync-ads","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Seth","last_name":"Tapper","permalink":"seth-tapper","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Marketing & Business Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Markowitz","permalink":"david-markowitz-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"NY","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/32665426?badge=0\" width=\"430\" height=\"242\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0021/5824/215824v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0021/5824/215824v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,318],"assets/images/resized/0021/5824/215824v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/meet-big-tech-trends-changing-marketing/237043/","title":"Meet the Five Big Tech Trends Changing Marketing - And 15 Startups That Will Get You to the Future"},{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10000872396390443589304577633664201676608-lMyQjAxMTAyMDEwMTAxODE3Wj.html?mod=wsj_valetleft_email","title":"MTV Aims for MultiTasker: PepsiCo, Verizon and Kraft Test Ads That Simultaneously Hit Different Platforms"}]}
