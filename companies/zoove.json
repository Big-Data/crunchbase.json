Instantly, they can be pushed that brandâ€™s mobile app, Web page, coupon, videos or more, directly to their mobile phones â€“ without the need to use bar code readers or disjointed text message short codes. </p>\n\n<p>StarStar Numbers are branded vanity mobile numbers designed to be promoted as part of any marketing campaign, such as: billboards, print or online ads, TV and radio commercials, consumer packaged goods and more. </p>\n\n<p>Zoove launched its national StarStar Number directory earlier in the Sprint of 2011 with vanity numbers serving several major brands such as <strong>SUZUKI (</strong>789854) for Suzuki and <strong>FLOWERS (</strong>3569377) for 1-800-FLOWERS.COM. A more comprehensive list of StarStar Numbers used in public campaigns is provided on the companyâ€™s website at www.zoove.com.  </p>\n\n<p>Brands or advertisers seeking to create or use a StarStar Number must register with Zoove, which provides the exclusive registry across wireless carriers. Zoove has exclusive technical integrations across carriers&#8217; networks that enable networks to recognize and process StarStar Numbers properly. Zoove also provides content review and oversight on behalf of wireless carriers to ensure that brands&#8217; marketing campaigns adhere to carrier guidelines and policies. Brands pay Zoove for their StarStar Number. Fees vary based on the length and scarcity of the number. Brands also receive access to Zoove&#8217;s cloud-based content management system. This simple Web-based console enables brands to plan and schedule their StarStar Number campaigns, by uploading, managing, and publishing their multimedia content to callers - along with real-time reports and analytics.</p>\n\n<p>Additional information about Zoove or StarStar Numbers can be found at www.zoove.com, or to reach a sales associate call (877) 283-5495 or simply call <strong>ZOOVE
