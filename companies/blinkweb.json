It allows users to create all the major website types such as a blog, a content style website, or a salesletter style website. Blinkweb comes equipped with many website templates that users can select from. Blinkweb believes that itâ€™s very important that Blinkweb created websites donâ€™t look â€œfactory manufacturedâ€. Because of this, coupled with a large selection of editing capabilities, allow users to create websites that look both unique and professionalâ€¦ all the while, requiring no html or technical skills.</p>\n\n<p>Blinkweb was designed from the ground up, for those people that either donâ€™t know html and all the other techie nonsense typically needed to create a website, or those that donâ€™t want to mess with the hassle of using complicated html editors like Dreamweaver or FrontPage, as well as bulky FTP software programs. Itâ€™s created for the average, everyday person that wants a website to either earn an online income, or simply keep in touch with friends and family.</p>\n\n<p>Users can choose from the 3 main types of websites found on the internet. These include blogs, content websites, and salesletter style websites. A blog is simply a web log allowing visitors to comment on various posts you would make to your blog. A content website is your â€œtypicalâ€ website you might find on the internet. Content websites might contain articles on a specific topic, or might sell some sort of product. A salesletter style website is often the website of choice in the â€œinternet marketingâ€ community. These are the long, scrolling websites typically used to sell a digitally downloadable product.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/2237/22237v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0002/2237/22237v1-max-250x250.png"],[[320,119],"assets/images/resized/0002/2237/22237v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Callen","permalink":"brad-callen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Callen","permalink":"matthew-callen","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":" Yola ","permalink":"yola","image":{"available_sizes":[[[76,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9965/99965v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[76,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9965/99965v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[76,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9965/99965v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Jimdo","permalink":"jimdo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4312/4312v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/4312/4312v1-max-250x250.png"],[[270,98],"assets/images/resized/0000/4312/4312v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Squidoo","permalink":"squidoo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/2698/2698v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/2698/2698v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/2698/2698v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sampa","permalink":"sampa","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0000/4336/4336v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,77],"assets/images/resized/0000/4336/4336v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,77],"assets/images/resized/0000/4336/4336v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Doodlekit","permalink":"doodlekit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/2407/2407v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[183,115],"assets/images/resized/0000/2407/2407v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[183,115],"assets/images/resized/0000/2407/2407v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":" Yola ","permalink":"yola","image":{"available_sizes":[[[76,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9965/99965v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[76,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9965/99965v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[76,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/9965/99965v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Webnode","permalink":"webnode","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0000/3223/3223v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0000/3223/3223v5-max-250x250.png"],[[283,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/3223/3223v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MyDND","permalink":"liveaps","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/1559/11559v4-max-150x150.png"],[[167,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/1559/11559v4-max-250x250.png"],[[167,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/1559/11559v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Fraktal","permalink":"fraktal","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/2113/22113v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/2113/22113v2-max-250x250.png"],[[255,92],"assets/images/resized/0002/2113/22113v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"uber platform","permalink":"uber-platform","image":{"available_sizes":[[[72,69],"assets/images/resized/0000/2428/2428v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[72,69],"assets/images/resized/0000/2428/2428v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[72,69],"assets/images/resized/0000/2428/2428v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Blinkweb Corporate Office","address1":"2159 Glebe Street","address2":"","zip_code":"46032","city":"Carmel","state_code":"IN","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.973067,"longitude":-86.198436}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
