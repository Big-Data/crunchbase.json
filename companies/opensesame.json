Content hosted on OpenSesame&#8217;s patent-pending platform will work on any Learning Management System (LMS).</p>\n\n<p>The marketplace enables content developers of all sizes to reach new buyers without investing in additional sales and marketing resources. </p>\n\n<p>OpenSesame launched in November 2010. In March 2011, OpenSesame won the 2011 Angel Oregon Competition sponsored by the Oregon Entrepreneurs Network. OpenSesame is based in Portland, Oregon.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/8905/108905v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/8905/108905v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0010/8905/108905v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Don","last_name":"Spear","permalink":"don-spear","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sr. Vice President & General Manager","person":{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Blank","permalink":"joshua-blank","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/8214/108214v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[241,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/8214/108214v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,310],"assets/images/resized/0010/8214/108214v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Business & Community Development","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Turnbull","permalink":"tom-turnbull","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/8963/78963v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,236],"assets/images/resized/0007/8963/78963v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,236],"assets/images/resized/0007/8963/78963v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/10/opensesame-raises-2m-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"OpenSesame Raises $2M in Funding","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Harmony Investments","permalink":"harmony-investments","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"OpenSesame Wins Oregon Entrepreneurs Network's 2011 Angel Oregon Investment Award, with $185,000 equity investment.
