IQ&#8217;s goal is to help their clients increase their effectiveness, productivity, and value by improving their overall applications development &amp; management process.</p>\n\n<p>They call themselves Insight Quality because they believe in using the insights gleaned from their years in the QA and software testing industry, while working for some of the biggest companies in the world. Theyâ€™ve been in the trenches and seen firsthand what can go wrong when things arenâ€™t done intelligently or flexibly.</p>\n\n<p>Led by founder Virginia Reynolds, IQ separates themselves from the rest by a philosophy they call &#8220;Smart Flexibility.&#8221;  IQ believes in a Quality Assurance process that is intelligent and flexible. They look under the hood of their clientsâ€™ systems and processes to see where they can make quality improvements.  Itâ€™s really one of the fundamental theories behind IQ&#8217;s business.</p>\n\n<p>They believe that their insight guides them to steer a clear path through complex process, system, and data relationships, allowing them to resolve challenging issues with efficient solutions. IQ bends the rules without compromising quality.  IQ knows when to yield, where to be pliable, and how to adjust readily to changing conditions.</p>\n\n<p>How and where does IQ apply this philosophy?  Well, it drives just about everything IQ does. Here a few examples:</p>\n\n<p>In requirements management: IQ believes in having an initial game plan at the start of a project while also having the insight to realize that changes should be expected along the way. Some folks are scared of change.  IQ&#8217;s approach is different. IQ recognizes (and welcomes) change and have built a process that allows for intelligent adjustments.</p>\n\n<p>In QA process definition: IQ knows that every organization is different, so not every methodology or life cycle works for every company.  IQ intelligently breaks the rules by very selectively applying only processes and templates that will have a beneficial impact on your teams rather than trying to implement a full methodology that would be better suited for, say, designing rockets.</p>\n\n<p>In test strategy: In an ideal world, IQ would have enough time, money and resources to test every possible scenario and data combination.  Since this is typically not the case, IQ applies their â€œSmart Flexibilityâ€ approach when creating a test strategy.  IQ identifies, designs, and executes their test suite using a risk-based approach, where they are intelligent about what they prioritize and test first, verses what can be tested later.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0014/2803/142803v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0014/2803/142803v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,197],"assets/images/resized/0014/2803/142803v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"Reynolds","permalink":"virginia-reynolds","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Web Design/Marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Pixel Soul Creative","permalink":"pixel-soul-creative","image":null}},{"title":"Messaging/Strategy","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Corporate Renegade","permalink":"corporate-renegade","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New York Office","address1":"244 Madison Ave","address2":"Suite 390","zip_code":"10016","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0014/2804/142804v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0014/2804/142804v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0014/2804/142804v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
