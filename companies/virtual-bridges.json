The companyâ€™s network of more than 40 partners extends its presence worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprise and mid-sized customers currently include K-20 educational systems, manufacturers, and oil and gas companies.</p>\n\n<p>Company History</p>\n\n<p>VERDE Suite</p>\n\n<p>Virtual Enterprise Remote Desktop Environment (VERDEâ„¢) is the companyâ€™s flagship product suite, comprised of:\nâ€¢ VERDE VDI Client \nâ€¢ VERDE CloudBranchâ„¢ Server\nâ€¢ VERDE SMARTâ„¢<br/>\nâ€¢ VERDE LEAFâ„¢</p>\n\n<p>VERDE VDI client authenticates users and provides access to user desktops session running on VERDE servers.  VERDE VDI client can run on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, netbooks and PDAs.  Users can launch more than one virtual desktop session simultaneously by running multiple client sessions and multiple monitors.</p>\n\n<p>VERDE CloudBranch Server connects to the central VERDE cluster and gold image repository to replicate the gold master images and subsequent updates. Desktop images are managed in the data center.  At the same time, the virtual desktop sessions are served locally from the VERDE CloudBranch Server.  This configuration provides LAN-level performance for users.  </p>\n\n<p>VERDE Self-managed Automatic Replication Technology (SMART) provides offline virtual desktop sessions launched from a PC, allowing users access to virtual desktops when disconnected from the network.</p>\n\n<p>VERDE Live Environment Access Format (LEAF) allows users to carry their virtual desktops on a portable drive for disconnected use.  Users connect the drive to any VT-enabled PC to securely launch their virtual desktops.</p>\n\n<p>VERDE SMART and VERDE LEAF technologies use the same centralized gold image.  If the userâ€™s gold master is updated on the central server, the same updates are reflected in the userâ€™s SMART and LEAF environments when connected to the central server.</p>\n\n<p>VERDE SMART and VERDE LEAF include bi-directional data synchronization for user documents to the central VERDE server.  Users can switch between VDI and disconnected use while maintaining the same desktop experience which can facilitate disaster recovery.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/0310/30310v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/0310/30310v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/0310/30310v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Win4Lin","permalink":"win4lin","image":null},{"name":"VERDE","permalink":"verde","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Marketing/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Perlman","permalink":"dan-perlman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Curtin","permalink":"jim-curtin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Leo","last_name":"Reiter","permalink":"leo-reiter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Jikku","last_name":"Venkat","permalink":"jikku-venkat","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Francese","permalink":"tom-francese","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Business Development, APAC","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Jim Clark","permalink":"dr-jim-clark","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Product Management","person":{"first_name":"Srini","last_name":"Gurrapu","permalink":"srini-gurrapu-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Sales","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Fidler","permalink":"brad-fidler","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"VMware","permalink":"vmware","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/9593/19593v2-max-150x150.png"],[[122,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/9593/19593v2-max-250x250.png"],[[122,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/9593/19593v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Citrix Systems","permalink":"citrix-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,49],"assets/images/resized/0005/5765/55765v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[103,49],"assets/images/resized/0005/5765/55765v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[103,49],"assets/images/resized/0005/5765/55765v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.texastechpulse.com/virtual_bridges_gets_new_funding/s-0026321.html","source_description":"Virtual Bridges Gets New Funding","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Austin Ventures","permalink":"austin-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/0806/10806v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/0806/10806v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/0806/10806v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Austin Office","address1":"6300 Bridge Point Parkway","address2":"Building 1; Suite 350","zip_code":"78730","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":30.27995,"longitude":-97.807274}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0007/4429/74429v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0007/4429/74429v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0007/4429/74429v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
