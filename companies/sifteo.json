Sifteo makes Sifteo cubes, an interactive game system designed for hands-on fun and Intelligent Play. They also make a growing number of games exclusive to Sifteo cubes.</p>\n\n<p>Sifteo cubes is a next generation game system consisting of physical blocks with full-color graphics that sense each other and their motion. The system offers an entirely new kind of interface that allows computer interactions to be more physical in nature: a truly hands-on computer the size and shape of a building block for maximum manipulability. Gestural detection technology makes interactive play with Sifteo cubes more intuitive, and allows players to use their hands to shake, flip, tilt, press, and neighbor Sifteo cubes to control the action.</p>\n\n<p>Sifteo began when co-founders Dave Merrill and Jeevan Kalanithi teamed up as graduate students at the MIT Media Lab. They wanted to re-think human-computer interaction by designing new, physical interfaces. One afternoon they sat around a table in the lab’s kitchen and imagined sorting through a pile of digital data as if it were a pile of LEGOs. The idea for Sifteo cubes was born.</p>\n\n<p>A few generations of prototypes later, Dave was invited to share their work by giving a presentation on the main stage at the TED conference in 2009 - and the talk went viral. This public enthusiasm galvanized the pair to found Sifteo Inc., and four months later Dave and Jeevan were at work in San Francisco building a company. </p>\n\n<p>Sifteo games are based upon the concept of Intelligent Play, combining classic play patterns and social aspects of games like chess and dominoes with the richness of interactive game technology. The Sifteo game library includes challenging games for adults, fun learning puzzles for kids, and games people can play together. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0012/5547/125547v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0012/5547/125547v2-max-250x250.png"],[[282,80],"assets/images/resized/0012/5547/125547v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jeevan","last_name":"Kalanithi","permalink":"jeevan-kalanithi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0013/7829/137829v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,248],"assets/images/resized/0013/7829/137829v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[439,437],"assets/images/resized/0013/7829/137829v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President / Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Merrill","permalink":"david-merrill","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Henricks","permalink":"alan-henricks","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Tami","last_name":"Bhaumik","permalink":"tami-bhaumik","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0002/1248/21248v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0002/1248/21248v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0002/1248/21248v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Gurevich","permalink":"alex-gurevich-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0611/150611v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/0611/150611v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/0611/150611v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"“bunnie” Huang","permalink":"andrew-bunnie-huang","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Fleming Wood","permalink":"simon-fleming-wood-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.chubbybrain.com/blog/sifteo-investors-complete-a-series-b-round-of-funding/","source_description":"","raised_amount":9000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Foundry Group","permalink":"foundry-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[164,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[164,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"True Ventures","permalink":"true-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0001/1176/11176v3-max-150x150.png"],[[191,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/1176/11176v3-max-250x250.png"],[[191,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/1176/11176v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"True Ventures","permalink":"true-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0001/1176/11176v3-max-150x150.png"],[[191,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/1176/11176v3-max-250x250.png"],[[191,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/1176/11176v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"National Science Foundation","permalink":"national-science-foundation","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Debut at CES;
