As with CMSs for static content, Yooba puts full creative power over Flash, right down to the object level - but without the need for programming skills - into the hands of editors and others responsible for site content origination and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application, there are no licensing issues with Yooba and users are always working with the latest version. The SaaS structure also gives full scalability on pricing, to suit anyone from individual professionals to enterprise companies.</p>\n\n<p>Once content is created, Yooba makes the efficient management of the Flash elements straightforward, which simplifies the scheduling and publication of created and edited material. This is carried out through Yoobaâ€™s graphical admin dashboard, which gives users total control of Flash objects within a website at a glance, making it easy to update and change them as frequently as information and sales campaigns require.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/7685/47685v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/7685/47685v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/7685/47685v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Yooba HQ","address1":"Box 3205","address2":"","zip_code":"103 64","city":"Stockholm","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":59.6121259,"longitude":17.8947672},{"description":"Yooba UK","address1":"St. James House","address2":"13 Kensington Square","zip_code":"W8 5HD","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5065001,"longitude":-0.1393362}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0004/7684/47684v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0004/7684/47684v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/7684/47684v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/7686/47686v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/7686/47686v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0004/7686/47686v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/7687/47687v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/7687/47687v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0004/7687/47687v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/7688/47688v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0004/7688/47688v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0004/7688/47688v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
