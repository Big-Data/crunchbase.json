Even more if it was achieved together with artists from out of your personal life.\nUnderstanding everyoneâ€™s differences and experiences necessarily increases maturity of project and involved artists. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0008/0731/80731v2-max-150x150.png"],[[231,230],"assets/images/resized/0008/0731/80731v2-max-250x250.png"],[[231,230],"assets/images/resized/0008/0731/80731v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"338\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10212293&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10212293&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Share the stage by oozer.com</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
