The result is relevant and engaging emails that dramatically lift email performance and drive greater customer experience and satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>ActivePath began as PostalGuard in 2007 with the goal of providing financial institutions a way to securely communicate with their customers via email. PostalGuard enabled bank customers to view bank statements, transfer funds between accounts, chat with personal financial advisors, and more – all without leaving their email. </p>\n\n<p>The more we learned about our customers&#8217; communications and marketing needs, the more we began to realize that there are bigger challenges. It is a problem shared by all web sites and marketers, regardless of the nature of their business. So we expanded our offering to solve for these challenges. </p>\n\n<p>We developed ActiveMail to boost customer engagement and improve email success rates. ActiveMail offers full web functionality, so email marketers can finally offer their customers a rich and interactive experience from within the messages they send. They’ll be able to watch videos, navigate menus, read live updates, share, comment, make purchases, fill out forms, chat with customer service, rate products, interact with rich ad formats and more…inside the email itself. Marketers can use our Inbox Icons to present their brands&#8217; symbols next to their newsletters or emails, thereby raising above the usual inbox clutter. There are more great features offered. Visit us at: www.activepath.com to learn more and to get in touch with us.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0011/4879/114879v4-max-150x150.png"],[[226,35],"assets/images/resized/0011/4879/114879v4-max-250x250.png"],[[226,35],"assets/images/resized/0011/4879/114879v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"ActiveMail","permalink":"activemail","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0018/7219/187219v5-max-150x150.png"],[[226,35],"assets/images/resized/0018/7219/187219v5-max-250x250.png"],[[226,35],"assets/images/resized/0018/7219/187219v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Aryeh","last_name":"Mergi","permalink":"aryeh-mergi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ram","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"ram-cohen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Management","person":{"first_name":"Micky","last_name":"Oland","permalink":"micky-oland","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Sagi","last_name":"Katz","permalink":"sagi-katz-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7627/197627v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7627/197627v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/7627/197627v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"S.
