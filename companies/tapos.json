Benjamin Monnig saw the Courier as a revolutionary idea and knew it still had a place in the current tablet market, although Microsoft had killed the project soon after the announcement of Apple’s iPad.  “The iPad is an amazing machine, but it lacks the Courier multitasking and content creation” – B.  Monnig.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of conception, neither Monnig nor Drake had the time or money to get Taposé off the ground.  Considering multiple funding options, they turned to the Kickstarter community to help make Taposé a reality.  March 23rd, Taposé was made public and 60 days later they had raised enough to begin work on June 1st, 2011.</p>\n\n<p>As the months went by, the development team grew slowly and got a big lift with the presence of lead design coordinator Jason Campbell.  Campbell provided a much needed face lift to Taposé and implanted the necessary user interface.  The result is a beautiful and intelligent design which can be described as a mix between Apple and Microsoft with a unique twist thrown in.</p>\n\n<p>On December 13, 2011, Taposé was launched on the Apple appstore.  Taposé made it from idea to reality in less five months with a small team and minimal resources.  “We were driven by the Kickstarter following and support, and the knowledge that Taposé could be a game changer” – B. Monnig.</p>\n\n<p>Check out out the Features page for all the current Taposé functionality, and the Forum page to ask questions or join in on community discussion.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0014/9922/149922v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0014/9922/149922v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0014/9922/149922v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Monnig","permalink":"benjamin-monnig-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Ricky","last_name":"Drake","permalink":"ricky-drake-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$75k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Private Investors","raised_amount":75000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":22,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
