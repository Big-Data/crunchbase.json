This is the #1 thing that families around the world want. If there is one common, universal desire of all people throughout the world, it is to give their children a better chance at life than they had.</p>\n\n<p>When you make a loan on Vittana, you&#8217;re really doing two things. Yes, you&#8217;re enabling a student to get a degree and get a job for an immediate, giant step toward a better life. But you&#8217;re also doing something even bigger: you&#8217;re proving to the world that education matters and student loans work for one student, one loan, one job at a time. Vittana works in the background to facilitate the loans you make directly to students but also works at the forefront of a global movement to bring student loans to young people throughout the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0007/1617/71617v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/1617/71617v2-max-250x250.png"],[[166,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/1617/71617v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder
