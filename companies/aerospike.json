Their goal was ambitious: to build the first data storage and management system with the ability to handle real-time big data at both blazing speed and infinite scale.</p>\n\n<p>Aerospike offers the only real-time NoSQL database and key-value store that delivers predictable high performance for mission-critical, Web-scale applications. Aerospike’s flash-optimized, shared-nothing architecture scales linearly, consistently processing over 200k transactions per second per node with sub-millisecond latency. With automatic fail-over, replication, and cross data center synchronization, the Aerospike database reliably stores billions of objects and terabytes of data—while providing 100% uptime and a 10x improvement in TCO over other NoSQL databases. Customers accelerating their business with Aerospike include adMarketplace, eXelate, Sony’s So-net, and The Trade Desk.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0020/8478/208478v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0020/8478/208478v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[332,70],"assets/images/resized/0020/8478/208478v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Observer","person":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"Yarmon","permalink":"joel-yarmon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,148],"assets/images/resized/0019/8873/198873v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,148],"assets/images/resized/0019/8873/198873v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,148],"assets/images/resized/0019/8873/198873v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.drapervc.com/team/\" title=\"Draper Associates Team Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">Draper Associates Team Page</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/08/aerospike-closes-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Aerospike Closes Series B Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":27,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"New Enterprise Associates","permalink":"new-enterprise-associates","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/5083/15083v3-max-150x150.png"],[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/5083/15083v3-max-250x250.png"],[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/5083/15083v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Alsop Louie Partners","permalink":"alsop-louie-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0001/0797/10797v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/0797/10797v2-max-250x250.png"],[[391,85],"assets/images/resized/0001/0797/10797v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Draper Associates","permalink":"draper-associates-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7951/197951v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0019/7951/197951v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0019/7951/197951v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20120828005396/en/database/big-data/NoSQL","source_description":"Aerospike Acquires AlchemyDB NewSQL Database to Build on Predictable Speed and Web-Scale Data Management of Aerospike Real-Time NoSQL Database","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":8,"acquired_day":28,"company":{"name":"AlchemyDB","permalink":"alchemydb","image":null}}],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2525 E Charleston Road","address2":"","zip_code":"94043","city":"Mountain View","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0020/8479/208479v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0020/8479/208479v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,351],"assets/images/resized/0020/8479/208479v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0022/3617/223617v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,207],"assets/images/resized/0022/3617/223617v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,373],"assets/images/resized/0022/3617/223617v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
