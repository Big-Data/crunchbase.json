It also provides robust back-office solutions, integrated to its mobile wallets, by partnering with top-notch technological companies.</p>\n\n<p>Its wallets can be accessed, in a fully secure fashion, from the different available mobile channels (apps, USSD, mobile web, SMS, etc.), as well as online, and possess a wide variety of transactional features, including in-store payments, P2P transfers, international remittances, bill payments, mobile coupons, loyalty programs, airtime top-ups, online purchases, etc. The wallets are associated to a store value account which can be linked to credit cards and bank accounts or loaded via cash-ins in agent networks (in case of unbanked users).</p>\n\n<p>Although CodaMation covers every mobile channel, it is deeply specialized in cross-platform, downloadable applications. After years of heavy R&amp;D investment, it has developed a WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) mobile transactional framework which enables its wallets to run smoothly in every handset, smartphone or feature phone, despite of OS, brand, screen size, etc., assuring maximum security levels. This framework gives CodaMation the opportunity to provide non-smartphone users – typical of developing countries – with compelling UXs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0016/6922/166922v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0016/6922/166922v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,196],"assets/images/resized/0016/6922/166922v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Federico","last_name":"Nano","permalink":"federico-nano","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Technology","person":{"first_name":"Matias","last_name":"Jaritonoff","permalink":"matias-jaritonoff","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Product & Innovation","person":{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"Baeza Vigil","permalink":"rafael-baeza-vigil","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Business Strategy","person":{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"Bouzas","permalink":"francisco-bouzas","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Sales","person":{"first_name":"Federico","last_name":"Nager","permalink":"federico-nager","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Administration & Finance","person":{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"Balbuena","permalink":"maria-balbuena","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Operations","person":{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"Zajic","permalink":"guillermo-zajic","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Fundamo (Proprietary)","permalink":"fundamo-proprietary","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0008/1234/81234v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[185,70],"assets/images/resized/0008/1234/81234v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[185,70],"assets/images/resized/0008/1234/81234v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"YellowPepper","permalink":"yellowpepper","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0010/7609/107609v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0010/7609/107609v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,134],"assets/images/resized/0010/7609/107609v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kony Solutions","permalink":"kony-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/4005/104005v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/4005/104005v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/4005/104005v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Utiba","permalink":"utiba","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"mFoundry","permalink":"mfoundry","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/3299/33299v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0003/3299/33299v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[432,144],"assets/images/resized/0003/3299/33299v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MoreMagic Solutions","permalink":"moremagic-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/5641/105641v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0010/5641/105641v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0010/5641/105641v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$6.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":6500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Grupo Roggio","permalink":"grupo-roggio","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Company HQ","address1":"Humboldt 2495 5th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"C1425FUG","city":"Buenos Aires","state_code":null,"country_code":"ARG","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Mexico Office","address1":"Alfonso Napoles Gandara 50 4th Floor","address2":"Col.
