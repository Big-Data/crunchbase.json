Capazoo comes with the obligatory set of social networking functions, including blogging, photo and video uploads, and profile pages. </p>\n\n<p>But after that, Capazoo differs in its offer to compensate its users for the time spent on the site. Members can tip other members using &#8220;Zoops,&#8221; Capzoo&#8217;s points program that can be redeemed for cash. Members also receive Zoops for inviting friends and posting content. Capazoo also has retail partners that offer discounts for users. </p>\n\n<p>Capazoo has reportedly raised over $25 million in private capital, without the aid of venture capital funding. Major investors include NFL, NHL and NBA personalities. National Lampoon, the satirical magazine publisher, also took a minor stake in the firm.</p>\n\n<p>Similar sites / competitors include <a href=\"http://www.cre8buzz.com/\" title=\"cre8buzz\" rel=\"nofollow\">cre8buzz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mylifebrand.com/\" title=\"MyLifeBrand.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MyLifeBrand.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.talentdatabase.com/\" title=\"TalentDatabase.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">TalentDatabase.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.clipstar.com/\" title=\"Clipstar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clipstar</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/2959/2959v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/2959/2959v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/2959/2959v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Capazoo","permalink":"capazoo","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder and President","person":{"first_name":"Grant","last_name":"Carter","permalink":"grant-carter","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":56.130366,"longitude":-106.346771}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
