Two weeks after the promised delivery, he finds out that somebody signed for him on the delivery voucher, and he never receives the TV hes been charged for.</li>\n<li>Mrs. Allen finds one day that she has been charged for over $1.000 from an overseas webmerchant she did not even know.</li>\n<li>Miss Moore discovers that a car has been bought under her name, with a bank account and a loan both opened under her name. She is being urged to pay for something that has been bought fraudulently using her identity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In a nutshell : the internet (4% of the payment market) is the source of 49% of payment fraud. And payment fraud is even lower than ID theft.</p>\n\n<p>To solve those issues, Cards Off offers a unique solution to buy online without ever using or transmitting personal information across the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Developed with a different approach, Cards Off offers a true one-click solution for consumers with a real cost-effective business model to the web merchants, as well as a totally secured function for the banks.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the process rupture, and how it is different :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Secure transaction end-to-end, secure payment being only a part of the full process,</li>\n<li>Never use a debit/credit card to pay online (no storage of personal / banking details or database that could be accessed online),</li>\n<li>Never transfer real world information (name, address, bank account number, debit/credit card numbers),</li>\n<li>No more theft / bad faith : the two-factor authentication (One-time Password + RFID chip) guarantees the physical delivery of goods.</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/4706/24706v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/4706/24706v1-max-250x250.png"],[[271,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/4706/24706v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":13,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"48, rue de Miromesnil","address2":"","zip_code":"75008","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":48.874602,"longitude":2.315812}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0007/6028/76028v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0007/6028/76028v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,316],"assets/images/resized/0007/6028/76028v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
