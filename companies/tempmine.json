The company believes that they&#8217;ve found a way to make the temps, employers, and agencies happier with a single solution. </p>\n\n<p>Temp workers create a profile on TempMine that is automatically updated as placements occur, providing more transparency and traceability to the process.  Employers can search directly for temps across the inventory of multiple agencies, finding the right fit.</p>\n\n<p>Agencies retain control over placements of their best temps. The temp agency only gets involved after the employer finds the exact temp they want. There is no cost to employers or temps to use TempMine, but they do take a 1% commission from the agencies. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0005/9496/59496v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0005/9496/59496v1-max-250x250.png"],[[298,97],"assets/images/resized/0005/9496/59496v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$18k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/10/techstars-debuts-nine-startups-in-boston/","source_description":"TechStars Debuts Nine Startups In Boston","raised_amount":18000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":11,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"TechStars","permalink":"techstars","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-150x150.png"],[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-250x250.png"],[[134,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/4033/4033v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
