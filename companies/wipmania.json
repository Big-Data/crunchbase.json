It allows identification of real geographic location of an IP address.</p>\n\n<p>WorldIP often displays different results from similar services, because it is based on data from core routers worldwide, and not just on whois data. There are 1.9 million of routers, the entire Internet including 5 million networks, 45 monitoring points worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>If real-time geolocation information is needed, the service is available in the form of API.</p>\n\n<p>Trace and Ping from WIPmania&#8217;s points around the world are useful to test the load on the network or availability of the server all over the world, to choose the &#8220;right&#8221; hoster, to define why and where the server is down, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There is also WorldIP add-on for Firefox based on WorldIP database, that displays up-to-date information about data center and real physical location of a web server.</p>\n\n<p>WorldIP can be used for geo targeting in e-commerce, combat with the fraud, spam and so on, protection of servers against various types of attacks on geographical indication.</p>\n\n<p>There are more specific information about all of this and other tools on WIPmania.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0007/6344/76344v2-max-150x150.png"],[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0007/6344/76344v2-max-250x250.png"],[[64,64],"assets/images/resized/0007/6344/76344v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"IP2Location","permalink":"ip2location","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1428/31428v2-max-150x150.png"],[[160,94],"assets/images/resized/0003/1428/31428v2-max-250x250.png"],[[160,94],"assets/images/resized/0003/1428/31428v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0007/6343/76343v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0007/6343/76343v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0007/6343/76343v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/wipmania-com-find-an-ip-anywhere","title":"WipMania.com - Find An IP Anywhere"},{"external_url":"http://www.zdnet.de/software_programme_loesungen_fuer_unternehmen_firefox_add_ons_fuer_bessere_bedienung_und_mehr_sicherheit_story-20000001-41524640-3.htm","title":"Firefox: Add-ons fÃ¼r bessere Bedienung und mehr Sicherheit"},{"external_url":"http://www.xakep.ru/post/45044/default.asp","title":"WIPmania.com â€“ Ð±ÐµÑÐ¿Ð»Ð°Ñ‚Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð³ÐµÐ¾Ð»Ð¾ÐºÐ°Ñ†Ð¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð±Ð°Ð·Ð° Ð´Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ñ… IP-Ð°Ð´Ñ€ÐµÑÐ¾Ð²"}]}
