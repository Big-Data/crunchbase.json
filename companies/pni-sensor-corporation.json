Our patented Magneto-Inductive (MI) reference sensors, systems and sensor suites provide accurate and reliable information for a wide range of applications, including robotics, surveying, navigation, and oceanography and consumer products.</p>\n\n<p>Our ready-to-integrate sensors and sensor systems enable companies to design sensors into their products without making a large investment in in-house sensor expertise. By combining best-in-class sensors with advanced software engines (including auto-calibration and measurement algorithms that can be adapted to the specific needs of an application), PNI&#8217;s products eliminate the time-consuming — and often unexpected — algorithm development and calibration work that significantly increase development costs and time to market.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & Founder","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"Hsu","permalink":"george-hsu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Becky","last_name":"Oh","permalink":"becky-oh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Taylor","permalink":"andrew-taylor","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"133 Aviation Blvd","address2":"","zip_code":"95407","city":"Santa Rosa","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.eetimes.com/design/smart-energy-design/4402420/Nintendo-Wii-U-GamePad-boasts-world-s-finest-motion-control","title":"Nintendo Wii U GamePad boasts world's finest motion control"},{"external_url":"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20121125/business/121129817","title":"Santa Rosa company brings back manufacturing jobs"},{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2012/11/27/forget-six-axis-gamepad-nine-axis/","title":"Forget the Sixaxis — the Wii U’s GamePad has nine-axis control Read more at http://venturebeat.com/2012/11/27/forget-six-axis-gamepad-nine-axis/#JP14mmXLhLGh2X15.99 "}]}
