AP is neither privately owned nor government-funded; instead, as a not-for-profit news cooperative owned by its American newspaper and broadcast members, it can maintain its single-minded focus on newsgathering and its commitment to the highest standards of objective, accurate journalism.</p>\n\n<p>Today, AP employs the latest technology to collect and distribute content. It is in the process of overhauling its video and photography content: transitioning to high-definition, expanding its coverage and building a new, flexible, powerful infrastructure. AP has the industry’s most sophisticated digital photo network; a 24-hour continuously updated online, multimedia news service; a state-of-the-art television news service; and one of the largest radio networks in the U.S. Its commercial digital photo archive is one of the world&#8217;s largest collections of historical and contemporary imagery. AP Mobile, the AP’s award-winning news app, has been downloaded over 12 million times since its launch in 2008, and AP has a strong social media presence, building new connections between AP and its members, customers and consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Pulitzer Prize was established, in 1917, AP has received 50 Pulitzers, including 30 photo Pulitzers.</p>\n\n<p>AP, which is headquartered in New York, has over 3,700 employees—two-thirds of them journalists and editors—in more than 300 locations worldwide, including every statehouse in the U.S.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7175/17175v3-max-150x150.png"],[[215,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7175/17175v3-max-250x250.png"],[[311,360],"assets/images/resized/0001/7175/17175v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President
