Kelkoo was bought by <a href=\"/company/yahoo\" title=\"Yahoo!\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yahoo!</a> in 2004 for $670 million. In 2007, Yahoo! began to hint at a possible sale, and in 2008 Jamplant, a UK-based private equity firm, purchased Kelkoo for an undisclosed sum.</p>\n\n<p>The company provides comparisons on over 2 million products including those by technology brands such as <a href=\"/company/apple\" title=\"Apple\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"/company/sony\" title=\"Sony\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sony</a> as well as non-tech brands such as Black &amp; Decker and Aston Martin.
