The company, founded by Dr. Kenji Shimada, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, is based on the patented BubbleMeshïƒ” technology, a product of more than 18 years of advanced research in the field of 3D digital modeling. BubbleMeshïƒ” enables the automated generation of high quality meshes for non-linear, multi-physics, and large-scale engineering analysis, which until now have been developed using costly manual labor. This automation dramatically increases the speed and quality of the engineering design process, for applications ranging from automobile crash simulation to complex fluid dynamic (CFD) and electromagnetic (EM) analysis.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[74,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/6989/96989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[74,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/6989/96989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[74,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/6989/96989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Kerns","permalink":"kevin-kerns","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Architect","person":{"first_name":"Uday","last_name":"Subbarayan","permalink":"uday-subbarayan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/3494/83494v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/3494/83494v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/3494/83494v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"https://www.ciespace.com/news","source_description":"Ciespace Corporation Secures $4 Million Series A Funding â€“ Names Kevin Kerns as Chief Executive","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"ARCH Venture Partners","permalink":"arch-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-150x150.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-250x250.png"],[[131,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/6165/36165v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The University of Tokyo Edge Capital","permalink":"the-university-of-tokyo-edge-capital","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"311 S.
