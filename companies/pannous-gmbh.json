Instead of typing in keywords and manually browsing through one or more web pages, technology is ready to accept spoken requests (through telephones or on a desk) and deliver the service that the user has in mind. Pannous was one of the first companies to bring this kind of new interaction to the mobile platform (Jeannie for android). Chatting robot agents that directly turn spoken commands into action are a leap in user experience. Artificial Intelligence does not yet mean that computers understand the data which they are handling but it does mean that they are capable of gathering all the data that is useful for the current context and act on it appropriately.</p>\n\n<p>The list of examples is only limited by imagination but includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>gathering of background information (news, schedules, facts, &#8230;)</li>\n<li>controlling devices through speech</li>\n<li>simplifying complicated tasks (booking of restaurants, tickets and so on)</li>\n<li>accelerating communication</li>\n</ul>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Karsten","last_name":"Fluegge","permalink":"karsten-flgge","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Siri, Inc","permalink":"siri-inc","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Siri","permalink":"siri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0002/6643/26643v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,181],"assets/images/resized/0002/6643/26643v5-max-250x250.png"],[[278,202],"assets/images/resized/0002/6643/26643v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Vlingo","permalink":"vlingo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4444/4444v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0000/4444/4444v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0000/4444/4444v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"German Headquarters","address1":"Hagenkampsweg 10","address2":"","zip_code":"25474","city":"Hasloh","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://jetwick.com","title":"Jetwick Twitter Search"},{"external_url":"http://www.voice-actions.com/","title":"Voice Actions / Virtual Assistant Jeannie"}]}
