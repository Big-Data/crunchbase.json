It allows buyers and suppliers to make and receive payments without credit cards, whilst still providing buyers with the consumer protection benefits that credit cards promise to offer.  In doing so, it simultaneously protects legitimate suppliers from fraudulent transactions.\nUTruePay says it is useful in any circumstances where a buyer of a good requires protection from supplier default, and does not want to, or is unable to pay by credit card. Such circumstances:\nA supplier is reluctant to accept a credit card as the fees paid may be prohibitively expensive for him/her.\nA supplier may be unwilling to accept a credit card for fear of being the victim of credit card fraud. \nA buyer may be looking to negotiate an improvement in price by not purchasing with a credit card.\nA buyer does not want to submit credit card details to a third party.\nUTruePay currently provides itâ€™s service to companies and individuals making payments INTO registered companies and partnerships within the UK. The service is in the process of being launched in the United States and Europe where companies in these regions can also be paid.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/7735/57735v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,73],"assets/images/resized/0005/7735/57735v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[208,73],"assets/images/resized/0005/7735/57735v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"PayPal","permalink":"paypal","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3943/3943v8-max-150x150.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/3943/3943v8-max-250x250.png"],[[200,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/3943/3943v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Listed Office","address1":"26 York Street","address2":"","zip_code":"W1U 6PZ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5205774,"longitude":-0.1587693}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"435\" height=\"270\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sVWaSv2OlmU&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sVWaSv2OlmU&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"435\" height=\"270\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0005/7734/57734v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,175],"assets/images/resized/0005/7734/57734v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,316],"assets/images/resized/0005/7734/57734v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0006/3774/63774v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,190],"assets/images/resized/0006/3774/63774v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,342],"assets/images/resized/0006/3774/63774v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
