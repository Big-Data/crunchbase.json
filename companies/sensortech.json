This technology uses advanced composites of conductive polymers as force sensors for precise measurement of pressure, force, torque, and vibration. </p>\n\n<p>Our patent pending technology was discovered while developing a methodology for measuring the contact pressure area of an artificial knee joint consisting of a hard metallic component articulating against a polymer bearing. It was discovered that the electrical properties of the polymer bearing could be altered without affecting its mechanical properties allowing for precise measurements of contact pressure distribution or force. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0006/7191/67191v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/7191/67191v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[346,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/7191/67191v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CTO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Clark","permalink":"andrew-clark-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/3528/63528v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/3528/63528v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[321,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/3528/63528v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.nextstart.org/thepeople\" title=\"NextStart\" rel=\"nofollow\">NextStart</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0006/7192/67192v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0006/7192/67192v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,265],"assets/images/resized/0006/7192/67192v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
