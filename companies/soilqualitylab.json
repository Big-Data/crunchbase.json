The current focus of SoilQualityLab involves its investigation of the critical-to-quality process parameters necessary to optimize the surface chemistry of engineered biochar and activated carbon nanoparticles.  The intent of this work is to understand what is necessary add significant value to the biochar [sequestered carbon] byproduct  produced along with bio-oil the renewable energy pyrolysis projects conducted by the non-profit PyrolyticEdge [for developing nations] and the for-profit startup AdvancedPyrolytics [for large-scale biomass-to-liquid renewable energy and custom bioproducts, e.g. plastic resin].   </p>\n\n<p>Although the pyrolysis platform has not received the favorable political sponsorship of corn ethanol or soy biodiesel, the energy yield [per unit of energy input] through the pyrolytic conversion of biomass is significantly higher than with grain-based or cellulosic ethanol.  If soil quality can be improved [to increase crop yields and reduce nutrient loss/pollution], it is expected that sequestering carbon for decades or centuries with engineered biochar will receive a significant amount favorable interest from investors.  Thus, SoilQualityLab&#8217;s proprietary research and agronomic  knowledge of the critical-to-quality process parameters for producing this biochar would become a valuable asset [as a data API] and a potential source of additional revenue and client connections&#8230; however, surface chemistry of biochar is only one subject of SoilQualityLab&#8217;s research program.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/1957/61957v2-max-150x150.png"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/1957/61957v2-max-250x250.png"],[[297,299],"assets/images/resized/0006/1957/61957v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Bruns","permalink":"mark-bruns","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Research Farm and Lab","address1":"3823 160th Street","address2":"","zip_code":"51237","city":"George","state_code":"IA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
