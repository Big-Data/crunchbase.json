At Friendburst you can customize profiles, groups, and blogs. </p>\n\n<p>Friendburst was founded in November of 2010 with the simple concept, give members what they want. At Friendburst you can customize your experience. Profile Layouts may be customized with CSS and HTML FOR example.  Videos and pictures may be embedded in profile, bulletins, forums and blogs. </p>\n\n<p>Friendburst is a full featured social network with blogs, groups, forums, and much more. They also offer over 600 pre-made profile layouts to choose from for those that want to get members profiles up and going fast without having to learn CSS or HTML. </p>\n\n<p>2011 saw a lot of changes in Friendburst based on member feedback. Added were such things as blog subscriptions, enhanced privacy features, friends bulletins, and the ability to customize Groups and Blogs with CSS. Premade layouts in 2011 went from 0 to over 600. </p>\n\n<p>Also in 2011 Friendburst created 2 videos. One is the Friendburst Manifesto which explains in detail the Friendburst philosophy of giving members what they want and not removing features from its members which in the opinion of the founder is what many of the social networks are doing, ignoring the needs of its members and taking features away. Here is the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_19i8bO9qNs </p>\n\n<p>The second video created, is a short promo video to give people a feel of Friendburst in less then 1 minute: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EryxuM8JIlY</p>\n\n<p>In November 2011 Friendburst introduced a new music section that allows musicians and bands a free music page where they can upload their music, videos and news. Members who follow these music pages are automatically notified when new information is added. The Friendburst music player may be embedded on profiles and also websites outside of Friendburst. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0018/5754/185754v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/5754/185754v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/5754/185754v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"MySpace","permalink":"myspace","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Friendster","permalink":"friendster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0000/4486/4486v64-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4486/4486v64-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4486/4486v64-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Socializr","permalink":"socializr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/1675/1675v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0000/1675/1675v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[256,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/1675/1675v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Bebo","permalink":"bebo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/3070/3070v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,74],"assets/images/resized/0000/3070/3070v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,74],"assets/images/resized/0000/3070/3070v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Atlanta Mailing Address","address1":"5 Concouse Parkway","address2":"","zip_code":"30328","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Friendburst Founded","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8577860.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"Friendburst Press Release","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Friendburst","permalink":"friendburst"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"360\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/EryxuM8JIlY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/EryxuM8JIlY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Friendburst Promo Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0018/5113/185113v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0018/5113/185113v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,266],"assets/images/resized/0018/5113/185113v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8577860.htm","title":"Friendburst Press Release"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/friendburst","title":"Friendburst YouTube Channel"},{"external_url":"http://www.blogtalkradio.com/joko/2010/11/28/the-myspace-3-point-oh-no-exodus-of-2010","title":"Blog Talk Radio Interview"}]}
