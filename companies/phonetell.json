PhoneTell is free to its Users. </p>\n\n<p>Users need only type or speak the name of the contact they&#8217;re trying to reach and PhoneTell&#8217;s proprietary and patent-pending CallRank(tm) algorithms search not only scours native phone contacts, but the User&#8217;s linked social accounts such as LinkedIn and Facebook and over 300M public and private business and personal listings&#8230;including thousands of &#8220;secret&#8221; customer service numbers assembled and hand-verified by PhoneTell to assure that human being answers the call and not an IVR system!  Search returns are User-experience informed; noting frequency, location, number of times successfully called by the User and his peers and are presented with one click to call simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, PhoneTell&#8217;s Call Assistant services ensure the User always knows who&#8217;s calling via instant reverse Caller ID, even if the caller isn&#8217;t in the User&#8217;s contact file&#8230;and even alerts Users to inbound calls from telemarketers.  Users can elect to return these calls when busy in a meeting or in a movie with a one-click custom SMS message that automatically lets the caller know the the call has been received and acknowledged.  It&#8217;s as simple as turning on the PhoneTell Do Not Disturb feature and just turning the phone upside down.  PhoneTell even puts a reminder to return the call on the User&#8217;s calendar.  What could be more useful?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, PhoneTell represents a major opportunity for marketers and businesses to place a highly targeted promotional message in the hands of a User who is looking for a product or service (via contextual search), physically close to the merchant (via geo-location) and ready to buy (during business hours).  This allows merchants to deliver a time-sensitive promotional message, perhaps redeemable in-store within a given time window, with zero waste, thus taking mobile lead-generation to its most useful and valuable level.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0008/7988/87988v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/7988/87988v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,145],"assets/images/resized/0008/7988/87988v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"PhoneTell for All Android","permalink":"phonetell-android","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"901 Marshall Street","address2":"Second Floor","zip_code":"94063","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Founded","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"PhoneTell","permalink":"phonetell"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/8824/88824v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/8824/88824v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/8824/88824v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7380/97380v8-max-150x150.png"],[[169,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/7380/97380v8-max-250x250.png"],[[305,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/7380/97380v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8815/98815v2-max-150x150.png"],[[169,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8815/98815v2-max-250x250.png"],[[305,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/8815/98815v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8817/98817v2-max-150x150.png"],[[170,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8817/98817v2-max-250x250.png"],[[306,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/8817/98817v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.phonetell.com","title":"Company website"}]}
