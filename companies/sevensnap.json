SevenSnap makes online-shopping mobile, entertaining and exciting.</p>\n\n<p>Every 60 minutes, SevenSnap offers in so-called â€žSnap Roomsâ€œ attractive consumer electronics gadgets, travel and leisure products. A SevenSnap member can enter the Snap Room and watch the price drop. Once the desired price is reached, itâ€™s time to snap - buying the item with the click of a button.</p>\n\n<p>â€œThe great thing about SevenSnap is that the price of a product can drop by up to $ 100,- per minute. Incredible attractive prices can be achieved. It is possible that a premium product, costing $ 1.000,- or more can go for only a few hundred USD.â€ explains Tobias Hieb, founder and CEO of SevenSnap.</p>\n\n<p>The price drop is financed by selling time credits. Each â€žSevenSnapperâ€œ needs time credits to be able to enter the Snap Room. Once in the room, the snapper can watch the falling price by the second and buy it any time for the amount currently shown. The more snappers are in the room, the quicker the price drops.</p>\n\n<p>â€œItâ€™s truly spectactular to watch the price drop fast, knowing that you can â€žsnapâ€œ at any given moment.â€ says Tobias Hieb. However, he cautions that snappers shouldnâ€™t wait too long. â€œIf you keep watching the price drop for too long, it is quite possible that another member decides to snap it before you have a chance. But that is exactly what makes SevenSnap so exciting and entertaining.â€</p>\n\n<p>Since transparency is very important in entertainment shopping, the Snap Room has its own live ticker showing who is in the room and at which price the product was last snapped.</p>\n\n<p>Tobias Hieb and his team are particularly proud of creating a SevenSnap application for the iPhone OS platform. â€œA product like SevenSnap simply has to be useable on mobile devices. Whether on a train, at the pool or waiting for a flight at the airport, SevenSnappers can always get a good deal.â€ Hieb says.</p>\n\n<p>Starting on August 23, 2009 the company presents SevenSnap on its website www.SevenSnap.com and allows a sneak peak into the Snap Room. Very soon the application will be available at the App Store and can be downloaded free of charge.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/4911/54911v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/4911/54911v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/4911/54911v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tobias","last_name":"Hieb","permalink":"tobias-hieb-hieb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/4910/54910v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/4910/54910v4-max-250x250.png"],[[260,260],"assets/images/resized/0005/4910/54910v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Frontend Designer","person":{"first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"KrÃ¶ber","permalink":"stefan-krber","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Cloud Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Rackspace","permalink":"rackspace","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/4598/14598v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,103],"assets/images/resized/0001/4598/14598v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,103],"assets/images/resized/0001/4598/14598v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://de.sevensnap.com/blog/pressemitteilung-jeff-coe-und-bjorn-von-siemens-investieren-in-sevensnap","source_description":"Jeff Coe & BjÃ¶rn von Siemens investing at SevenSnap","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarter","address1":"Grete-Henry-StraÃŸe 7","address2":"","zip_code":"37085","city":"GÃ¶ttingen","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":51.519824,"longitude":9.9775149}],"milestones":[{"description":"SevenSnap was submitted at the App Store Austria, Germany & Switzerland.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":11,"source_url":"http://de.sevensnap.com/blog/sevensnap-wurde-in-den-app-store-eingereicht","source_text":null,"source_description":"SevenSnap was submitted at the App Store","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"SevenSnap Entertainment GmbH","permalink":"sevensnap"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0005/4912/54912v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,218],"assets/images/resized/0005/4912/54912v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,394],"assets/images/resized/0005/4912/54912v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0005/7386/57386v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,239],"assets/images/resized/0005/7386/57386v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,431],"assets/images/resized/0005/7386/57386v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sevensnap.com","title":"SevenSnap Website"}]}
