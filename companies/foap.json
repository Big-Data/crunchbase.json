Snap or upload a photo via our iPhone App and if it gets approved it will be published at www.foap.com for editorial/commercial sale for companies which are looking for marketing material. Each photo can be sold unlimited amount of times, and we split the revenue with on a 50/50 basis. The current price is $10 per photo that is licensed. </p>\n\n<p>The goal is to build a image database that has a constant massive inflow of photos since we know that photo buying companies are looking for more variation. Also, we want to build a database consisting of more natural and local photos, and avoid feeding the market with something that it&#8217;s already overwhelmed of: that is typical arranged stock modeling photos.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7116/197116v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0019/7116/197116v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0019/7116/197116v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"kr3.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://oresundstartups.com/foab-receives-3-5m-sek-from-korea/","source_description":"FOAP RECEIVES 3.5M SEK FROM KOREA","raised_amount":3500000,"raised_currency_code":"SEK","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Jade Global Investments","permalink":"jade-global-investments","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
