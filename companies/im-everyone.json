Each post has typography, images, and video attached.</li>\n<li>Posts are pushed to the top of the site via interaction (views, comments, and likes).</li>\n<li>The site runs in realtime - new content is pushed to all users in the &#8216;Live&#8217; area immediately</li>\n<li>Conversations between strangers. Each participant is assigned a unique, temporary avatar to allow people to identify the poster and commenters in different replies.</li>\n<li>Extensive curation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Socially, the site appeals to a wider, more mature and more female audience than most of the sites competitors, with around a 70/30 women/men split and most posters in the 25-35 group.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0011/3391/113391v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0011/3391/113391v2-max-250x250.png"],[[387,117],"assets/images/resized/0011/3391/113391v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"MacCana","permalink":"mike-maccana","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0011/5132/115132v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,223],"assets/images/resized/0011/5132/115132v3-max-250x250.png"],[[400,357],"assets/images/resized/0011/5132/115132v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Unit 3, ","address2":"7A Plough Yard ","zip_code":"EC2A 3LP","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launch","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":27,"source_url":"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1940089","source_text":null,"source_description":"I'm Everyone, a live, anonymous image/video site","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"I'm Everyone","permalink":"im-everyone"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/17679593\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/17679593\">I'm Everyone - live photo-confessions project.</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user5449257\">Mike MacCana</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>App Overview</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"288.75\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UArB8pldBNI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UArB8pldBNI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"288.75\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0011/3390/113390v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0011/3390/113390v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0011/3390/113390v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0011/5008/115008v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0011/5008/115008v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,275],"assets/images/resized/0011/5008/115008v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techfluff.tv/2010/12/19/think-it-all-happens-in-silicon-valley-youre-wrong-series-techfluff-talks-to-imeveryone/","title":"Think it all happens in Silicon Valley?
