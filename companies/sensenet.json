In October 2008, the company launched Sense/Net 6.0, the only enterprise-grade open-source portal builder available on .NET.</p>\n\n<p>Sense/Net was founded in Hungary in 1995 with a vision to create friendly and accessible website-building tools for businesses. It also wanted to combine open-source technology with the .NET platform, in a movement that Sense/Net calls &#8216;hybrid open source&#8217; â€“ providing an alternative to proprietary tools without abandoning .NET.</p>\n\n<p>Sense/Net has dominated the Hungarian market for over 15 years, with clients including E.ON, Hungary&#8217;s National Bank and the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office. Its technology was also used to manage video content for the website of Hungaryâ€™s first reality show &#8216;The Bar&#8217;, as well as the Hungarian series of &#8216;Big Brother&#8217;.</p>\n\n<p>Still based in Budapest, Sense/Net&#8217;s revenues now exceed â‚¬1 million and its staff has grown to over 40 people. The company is divided into two business units: one to deliver services to clients; and one to manufacture its solutions and supply them to resellers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/6834/26834v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/6834/26834v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,186],"assets/images/resized/0002/6834/26834v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SenseNet 6.0","permalink":"sensenet-6-0","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder / Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Tamas","last_name":"Biro","permalink":"tamas-biro-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder / CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sandor","last_name":"Kiss","permalink":"sandor-kiss-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Pfaff","permalink":"robert-pfaff-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dane","last_name":"Atkinson","permalink":"dane-atkinson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7117/77117v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,220],"assets/images/resized/0007/7117/77117v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,220],"assets/images/resized/0007/7117/77117v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Peter Aron","last_name":"Zentai","permalink":"aron-peter-zentai-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Sales Director","person":{"first_name":"Gabor","last_name":"Szaniel","permalink":"gabor-szaniel-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Alfresco","permalink":"alfresco","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/2913/22913v1-max-150x150.png"],[[173,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/2913/22913v1-max-250x250.png"],[[173,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/2913/22913v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sense/Net","address1":"H-1117 Budapest","address2":"Infopark sétány 1","zip_code":"","city":"Infopark \"I\" building","state_code":null,"country_code":"HUN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
