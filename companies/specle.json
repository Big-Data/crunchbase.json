They can then pay to use Specle&#8217;s services to upload, validate, then deliver advertising directly to the publisher - in some cases, directly into the flat plan of the publication.</p>\n\n<p>Specle is known to provide simple, elegant, yet sophisticated technology for creative customers. The systems are designed to work both for one-time advertisers, all the way through to large advertising brands delivering hundreds of ads a day. It is a highly customer focused business and the team works closely with businesses to come up with targeted solutions, and provides unparalleled levels of support to both and large customers.</p>\n\n<p>Specle has recently launched into the tablet (e.g. iPad) publishing market, and is leading specification development for the next generation of tablet
