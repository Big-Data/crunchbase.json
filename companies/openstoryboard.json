Through open collaboration on fiction projects it produces prime community sourced stories, uncovers and promotes hidden writing talents. </p>\n\n<p>HOW DOES IT WORK?\nA creative writer, high-profile figure or yourself start the first chapter of a new story. While chapter by chapter are being published, everyone can join in and branch off to take the story into a new direction. The result is a â€˜treeâ€™ of stories from one beginning towards multiple endings touching on various genres and styles. Besides this intriguing collaborative approach authors can also launch a classic story, which they structure and carry through all on their own â€“ from the beginning till the end.</p>\n\n<p>Readers around the world can enjoy the freedom to choose where the story continues. While they review and rate what they have read, successful stories and talented writers emerge and can be commercialized through print, on screen, or any other form of media.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT DOES IT OFFER?\nAny user can join reading. Writers start as Freshman, advance via Graduate and Master to Director. On their way they first start to convince the community with a certain quantity and quality of their writing, before a panel votes who takes the final step to Director: Online talent can be scouted for the traditional, offline world.</p>\n\n<p>Stories are published chapter by chapter: They evolve from unpublished via published and rated to prime content. Prime content is available in online stores as professionally edited ebook, while all content is ready for every license taker and use in other media. Ratings and demography provide the distinction to all other unproven work.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0011/4683/114683v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[198,170],"assets/images/resized/0011/4683/114683v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[198,170],"assets/images/resized/0011/4683/114683v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0011/4681/114681v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,175],"assets/images/resized/0011/4681/114681v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,315],"assets/images/resized/0011/4681/114681v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0011/4682/114682v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,174],"assets/images/resized/0011/4682/114682v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,314],"assets/images/resized/0011/4682/114682v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
