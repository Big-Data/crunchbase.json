We believe that bullet points and resume-based career search platforms fail to support college students transitioning from collegiate life to professional career.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional resumes and career networking platforms inadequately depict the achievements of college students with little to no professional work experiences. To serve this vital segment, Seelioâ€™s dynamic multimedia platform offers a visual approach for students to display their college experiences and illuminate their unique personalities. Presented with a comprehensive view into the background and accomplishments of students, employers can select better candidates in less time than previously possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/0034/200034v5-max-150x150.png"],[[239,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/0034/200034v5-max-250x250.png"],[[430,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/0034/200034v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"Lee","permalink":"moses-lee","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Jsa","permalink":"david-jsa","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CDO","person":{"first_name":"Jerry","last_name":"Wang","permalink":"jerry-wang","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7581/97581v2-max-150x150.png"],[[124,170],"assets/images/resized/0009/7581/97581v2-max-250x250.png"],[[124,170],"assets/images/resized/0009/7581/97581v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$200k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Fry","permalink":"david-fry","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Rudy","last_name":"Pataro","permalink":"rudy-pataro","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Spark Ann Arbor","permalink":"spark-ann-arbor","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"505 E.
