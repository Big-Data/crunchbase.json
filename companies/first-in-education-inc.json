We are dedicated to redelivering value to learning by motivating creativity through passions of North Carolinaâ€™s citizens.</p>\n\n<p>It is First In Educationâ€™s belief, desire, and pursuance that by providing an outlet that allows communities to exchange ideas and services it will consequently result in the rebranding of how North Carolinaâ€™s youth will envision education. Our purpose is to be the catalyst that promotes creativity through passions, thus giving new respect and value back to learning.</p>\n\n<p>Our service will cater to K-12th grade educators and students in the private, public, charter and home school market. Using a video based platform teachers and students can express their passion and be matched with professionals with similar passions. First In Educationâ€™s team will evaluate every passion project as they are posted on the website and use a high quality interactive database that will match professionals in order to fund local teacher initiatives and large-scale statewide projects or find value added volunteer opportunities and tutoring services for students. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of the marketplace is to ease the learning barrier caused by under funding and under resourcefulness. By putting the tools directly into the hands of the public this grassroots approach promises to restructure a broken system for students to learn, thus reshaping teacherâ€™s time, and redefining how donations are given. Furthermore, this revolutionary approach to connecting donors with education incentives will realign how community participation evolves over the coming decade.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0016/4132/164132v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0016/4132/164132v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0016/4132/164132v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Lattimer","permalink":"chris-lattimer","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"Fields","permalink":"joe-fields","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Fields","permalink":"bill-fields-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
