The team is deeply founded in their roots stemming from their founder, John Tershowski. John and his wife, Margaret built their business for over 30 years, conducting the business with honesty and integrity.</p>\n\n<p>Margaret Tershowski</p>\n\n<p>Margaret Tershowski has been a licensed broker associate for over 30 years. She originally began her Real Estate career in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1974. While obtaining her broker associate license, she met John Tershowski. The two had a similar passion for Real Estate, and a strong desire to help other families find houses they could call home. Margaret received her broker’s license in 1976, and shortly after her and John were married.</p>\n\n<p>Later the couple then moved to Tampa, Florida in 1977 where they made their home. Utilizing her experience of working in a Title Agency for 5 years, Margaret joined her husband to form their partnership in the Tampa Real Estate industry, the original Team Tershowski. She is still dedicated to the mission of serving homebuyers and homesellers with integrity and honesty and enjoys passing on her knowledge to her daughter, Kaia with whom she has formed the new generation of Team Tershowski.</p>\n\n<p>Kaia Tershowski</p>\n\n<p>Kaia Tershowski graduated from the University of Florida with her Bachelors’ in Science in Advertising and Business Administration in 2010, and received her Masters’ in Science in Business Management in May 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Kaia developed her real estate experience in the Carrollwood area, where she helped Team Tershowski consult clients on buying and selling houses while home from college.
