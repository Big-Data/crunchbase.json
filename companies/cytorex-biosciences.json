CytoregÂ® can cross the blood brain barrier due to its very low molecular weight.</p>\n\n<p>Clinical Trials ara expected to start late 2010 or early 2011 subject to funding.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/5500/55500v4-max-150x150.png"],[[211,236],"assets/images/resized/0005/5500/55500v4-max-250x250.png"],[[211,236],"assets/images/resized/0005/5500/55500v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & CEO","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Martucci","permalink":"david-martucci","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director & COO","person":{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"M.
