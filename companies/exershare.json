Although many people consider being fit purely physical, they are wrong.  Being physically fit is very important but it is difficult to do so without becoming mentally fit. </p>\n\n<p>â€œFor the first time ever, overweight people outnumber average people in America. Doesn&#8217;t that make overweight the average then? Last month you were fat, now you&#8217;re average - hey, let&#8217;s get a pizza!â€ â€“ Jay Leno</p>\n\n<p>Although people find humor in the unhealthy lifestyles people often lead, poor nutrition, overeating , eating disorders, and stress have become a very big problem when  it comes to weight and health.  Obesity rates have been reaching epidemic proportions in the US.  Eight out of ten people over the age of 25 is overweight.     Because of this horrifying statistic, there have been more and more efforts to counteract the unhealthy life.  </p>\n\n<p>Many people have found a passion in taking pride in oneâ€™s health and getting and staying fit as difficult as it may be.  There have been magazines that have tried spreading the message to the public as well as reality/competition shows that would do the same.  And now with the boom of technology, it is time for this common goal to be seen on the web.  ExerShare was first launched in September 2009.  Its founders created ExerShare as a user-content driven hub for health and fitness professionals and the general public to both post and access exercise, nutrition and other health-related Content.  Content includes videos, articles, workout plans, nutrition plans, and a discussion forum. Instead of searching numerous websites searching for different articles on nutrition, then searching through multiple websites for a how-to video for Pilates and Yoga, then searching for a good discussion forum to talk about the best way to lift weights, ExerShare hopes to save people the effort making it even easier for them to choose to live a healthy, fit life.  By creating a home for all those who exercise in different ways, professionals and the public learn many different tips from others while simultaneously teaching others by posting content they created themselves or found useful.  </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Burger","permalink":"ryan-burger","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.exershare.com","title":"ExerShare - exercise. share. discover"}]}
