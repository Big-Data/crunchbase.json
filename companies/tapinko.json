There are millions of places for people to advertise offlineâ€”traditional options such as newspapers and billboards as well as non-traditional options like empty walls, vehicles and even bodiesâ€”but no easy way for buyers and sellers to place or solicit advertising. TapInko believes that offline advertising should be as easy as online advertising. From search-and-find to transaction completion, TapInko provides a simpler alternative to the traditional labor-intensive current process. For traditional outlets like newspapers, what used to take weeks, now takes minutes. For newer outlets, TapInko provides the first and only marketplace for buyers and sellers. In addition, TapInko also provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage the process; complete with file back-up, sales tracking and internal messaging.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/5052/35052v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0003/5052/35052v1-max-250x250.png"],[[312,144],"assets/images/resized/0003/5052/35052v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/04/dreamit-incubator-holds-funding-day-to-commemorate-first-graduating-class/","source_description":"DreamIt Incubator Holds Funding Day To Commemorate First Graduating Class","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"DreamIt Ventures","permalink":"dreamit-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"327\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1916636&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1916636&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"327\"></embed></object><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/1916636\">Meet TapInko!</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user820888\">DreamIt Ventures</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Product Description</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
