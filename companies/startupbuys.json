We realize that itâ€™s hard enough for a new, small business to succeed. Thatâ€™s why we do not take any portion of the proceeds derived from any coupon offerings by our members.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to our coupon section, we have a multitude of other features including our Directory section, Sourcing section, Networking (Q&amp;A and Groups) section, Jobs (Job Board &amp; Resumes) section, Events section, and Blogs section.
