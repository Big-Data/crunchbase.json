Founded in 2010, Contextin uses novel pattern recognition algorithms to enhance online advertising performance. Unlike conventional demand-side platforms that must be supplied with predetermined audience criteria, Contexin uses an automated discovery engine to identify user groups, based on hundreds of non-traditional attributes, with the highest probability of response - and to price and buy placements accordingly. The result is dramatically higher ad performance, optimized costs (CPM, CPA or CPC), and capture of previously untapped audiences.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the webâ€™s leading brands are transforming their ad buying model with Contextin, including Capital One, Microsoft, Swarovski, Kellogg, Subway, YouTube and more. </p>\n\n<p>Contextin is a privately held company headquartered in New York City with R&amp;D in Tel Aviv.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0004/0726/40726v11-max-150x150.png"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0004/0726/40726v11-max-250x250.png"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0004/0726/40726v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"ContextIn","permalink":"contextin","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Yoav","last_name":"Naveh","permalink":"yoav-nave","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Gil","last_name":"Shif","permalink":"gil-shif","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Santo","last_name":"Politi","permalink":"santo-politi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5684/105684v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[237,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/5684/105684v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[321,338],"assets/images/resized/0010/5684/105684v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Santo Politi</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tomer","last_name":"Afek","permalink":"tomer-afek-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director in Board ","person":{"first_name":"Yaron","last_name":"Carni","permalink":"yaron-carni","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/7793/67793v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0006/7793/67793v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0006/7793/67793v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"ContextIn","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"ContextIn selected as finalist for Plugg.Eu in Belgium","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":26,"source_url":"http://www.plugg.eu/media/blog/p/detail/these-are-the-20-finalists-for-pluggs-start-ups-rally","source_text":"","source_description":"ContextIn selected as finalist in Plugg.eu ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"ContextIn","permalink":"contextin"}},{"description":"ContextIn selected to participate in California Chamber of Commerce's Israel Web Tour","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":9,"source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/09/israel-web-tour-brings-startups-to-the-valley/","source_text":null,"source_description":"ContextIn selected to participate in Israel Web Tour","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"ContextIn","permalink":"contextin"}},{"description":"CONTEXTin added Yoav Naveh as Founder and CEO","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"ContextIn","permalink":"contextin"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
