For OEM partners, BriefCam supplies a software development kit (SDK) that enables vendors to retain their own look and feel.

BriefCam works with local dealers in the US Europe, the UK and the Far East and reaches out to potential end-users via resellers such as system integrators.</p>\n\n<p>Customers include police, military, border control and other Homeland Security agencies, as well as security authorities at municipalities, airports, railways, sea and other transportation authorities, banks, office building management, retailers&#8230; in short, anyone using video recording can utilize Video Synopsis to better monitor, safeguard and/or reduce loss at their locations and facilities.</p>\n\n<p>BriefCam was founded in 2007 on the strength of technology developed at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and licensed by the university to the company.
