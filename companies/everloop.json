Everloop&#8217;s Social Loop, a loop of safety around kids&#8217; connections, introduces state-of-the-art privacy protection and monitoring, keeping tweens from sharing more than they should with people outside their approved loops.</p>\n\n<p>Everloopâ€™s user experience offers easy profile customization and realtime communications, including email, IM, chat and voice chat. Real-time posts and video uploading, Loops of common interest and a universal Evercredit system are among the siteâ€™s many unique features. In addition, Everloop Video Network publishes original tween-centric web series, like â€œIn the Loop with Dani,â€ hosted by Everloop tween spokesperson Dani; and the Everloop Games Arcade offers more than 1,500 games. The siteâ€™s virtual Everstore lets members cash in their Evercredits for stickers and fun interactive Goobs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0012/9855/129855v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,81],"assets/images/resized/0012/9855/129855v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,81],"assets/images/resized/0012/9855/129855v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Patent Counsel","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Schox Patent Group","permalink":"schox-plc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0019/1593/191593v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[195,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/1593/191593v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[195,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/1593/191593v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"title":"Counsel","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cobalt LLP","permalink":"cobalt-llp","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$3.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/12/social-network-for-kids-everloop-lands-3-1-million-in-new-funding/","source_description":"Social Network For Kids Everloop Lands $3.1 Million In New Funding","raised_amount":3100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":13,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"VFormation","permalink":"vformation","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Band of Angels","permalink":"band-of-angels","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/2895/22895v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[133,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/2895/22895v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[133,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/2895/22895v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Envoi Ventures","permalink":"envoi-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Chino","permalink":"richard-chino","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Wayne","last_name":"Goodrich","permalink":"wayne-goodrich","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Deena","last_name":"Burnett-Bailey","permalink":"deena-burnett-bailey","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Wu","permalink":"david-wu-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0011/6787/116787v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,169],"assets/images/resized/0011/6787/116787v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,169],"assets/images/resized/0011/6787/116787v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"9000 Crow Canyon Road Suite S 240 ","address2":"","zip_code":"94506","city":"Danville","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fH40dIXs14A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Everloop Commercial</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0015/0335/150335v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,189],"assets/images/resized/0015/0335/150335v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,341],"assets/images/resized/0015/0335/150335v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
