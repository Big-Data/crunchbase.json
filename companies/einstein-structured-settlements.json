The issue is most clients have a need for a lump sum payment and they need the money right away. It&#8217;s important for them to receive the money that they need while we work hard to get them the funding that they desire. </p>\n\n<p>Factoring companies look at the best way to &#8220;maximize&#8221; your settlement. This means that you need to get a large lump sum payment at once. Thanks to Einstein you can work with a genius and receive timely payments. </p>\n\n<p>In the end it&#8217;s their money and they want it now as you probably have heard on the commercials and we are glad to be the ones who set up the funding and ensure that they get the money that they need thanks to Einstein. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0022/0473/220473v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0022/0473/220473v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,240],"assets/images/resized/0022/0473/220473v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Los Angeles Office","address1":"5600 Wilshire Blvd.","address2":"","zip_code":"90036","city":"los angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
