However, traditional comparison websites only compare vehicle finance prices based on car loans which account for only c.20% of all new car finance.  FinanceAcar instantly compares all finance options (car loans, hire purchase and car leasing) and thereby empowers car shoppers with information that has never been available in one place by answering the question: What is the lowest monthly price I need to pay to drive the car that I want? </p>\n\n<p>FinanceAcar allows a user to select their preferred new vehicle by make and model, by budget and/or by car type and then it tells them the cheapest monthly price to finance that car. Importantly, it is not just a comparison website but also an ecommerce website. A user can choose their car, select their finance and insurance deals, complete a credit check and application and have the car delivered to their front door.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0008/0544/80544v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,38],"assets/images/resized/0008/0544/80544v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,68],"assets/images/resized/0008/0544/80544v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nadim","last_name":"Saad","permalink":"nadim-saad","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Peatey","permalink":"mark-peatey","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2011/08/03/financeacar-raises-funding-for-online-car-marketplace/","source_description":"FinanceAcar raises funding for online car marketplace","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":3,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Anthemis Group","permalink":"anthemis-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/8316/38316v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0003/8316/38316v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,376],"assets/images/resized/0003/8316/38316v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Dominic","last_name":"Collins","permalink":"dominic-collins","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Christoph","last_name":"Janz","permalink":"christoph-janz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,87],"assets/images/resized/0001/7257/17257v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[73,87],"assets/images/resized/0001/7257/17257v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[73,87],"assets/images/resized/0001/7257/17257v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Second Floor, Cardiff House","address2":"Tilling Road","zip_code":"NW2 1LJ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0014/7729/147729v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,211],"assets/images/resized/0014/7729/147729v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,380],"assets/images/resized/0014/7729/147729v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/08/11/cant-afford-that-bmw-financeacar-launches-car-finance-comparison-engine/","title":"Techcrunch article"},{"external_url":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/aug/11/financeacar-startup","title":"Guardian article on FinanceAcar"}]}
