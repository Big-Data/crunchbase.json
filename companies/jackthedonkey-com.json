Or what some call, a socially conscious social network.</p>\n\n<p>Jack donates more than half of all ad revenue generated by an individual&#8217;s time online to their choice of more than 20 charities from across Canada and the US, and now the UK to the tune of 1.1 cents every impression (paid at par depending where the charity is registeredâ€¦or at least that is the theoryâ€¦the advertisers to date have been friends and family so I have been covering the 1.1 cents myself). The number of impressions and how you create them is up to you.  Simply sharing, viewing or commenting on pictures or â€œdeep thoughtsâ€ makes cents!</p>\n\n<p>Jack also takes a &#8220;softsell&#8221; approach to keeping the charities top of mind among existing supporters, while trickling into the consciousness of potential supporters, as the charities&#8217; Twitter feeds have recently been incorporated into their supporters&#8217; personal profile pages&#8230;viewable to the community.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the name will always sound a little untraditional, but JackTheDonkey.com is working to connect with individuals who are traditionally unengaged from anything remotely related to volunteerism and fundraising.</p>\n\n<p>There is another key component to the site that we are rolling out in the near future which will provide an additional stream of funds for the charities on jackthedonkey.com.</p>\n\n<p>There are more than  20 charities from across Canada, the US and now the UK that you can choose to support with your time online including: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alex&#8217;s Lemonade Stand Foundation </li>\n<li>Best Friends Animal Society (featured on Dogtown) </li>\n<li>The ALS Society of Canada </li>\n<li>Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation </li>\n<li>Canadian Tire JumpstartÂ® </li>\n<li>Card Therapy </li>\n<li>Children&#8217;s Craniofacial Association </li>\n<li>The Children&#8217;s Wish Foundation of Canada </li>\n<li>Eating Disorders of York Region </li>\n<li>Lilah&#8217;s Fund </li>\n<li>The Malibu Foundation for Environmental Education </li>\n<li>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada </li>\n<li>New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity </li>\n<li>Ontario Special Olympics </li>\n<li>Pencils For Kids </li>\n<li>Plug In America (featured in Who Killed The Electric Car?) </li>\n<li>Ronald McDonald House Charities of Canada </li>\n<li>The Reena Foundation </li>\n<li>The Scouts Canada Foundation </li>\n<li>Sustainable Laos Education Initiatives Inc. </li>\n<li>The Toronto Wildlife Centre </li>\n<li>The Safe Foundation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Attached is a copy of my first piece of press that I was able to generate locally earlier this summer:

</p>\n\n<p>http://www.killerstartups.com/Social-Networking/jackthedonkey-com-support-a-charity-the-social-way </p>\n\n<p>www.JackTheDonkey.com is free for the charities and members of the community, but not for the corporate sponsors/advertisers (who we are actively working to get onboard&#8230;to date they have been friends and family so I have not been charging them while I continue to pay the 1.1 cents per impression to the charities).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/7063/57063v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0005/7063/57063v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,310],"assets/images/resized/0005/7063/57063v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President,
