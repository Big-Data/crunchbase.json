Yup, for students or business professionals who want to collaborate around textbooks or any other document, CafeScribe is your thing. </p>\n\n<p>Upload any type of document (yes, like scribd) or buy an e-Book or e-Textbook and start sharing notes.  Any note you add to your document or e-Book is broadcast on CafeScibe. Anyone else can subscribe to your notes or thoughts.  Anyone can rank how well they think your notes are by giving a thumbs up or thumbs down or rank your &#8220;genius&#8221; level. </p>\n\n<p>You can also upload, annotate and share their own books and documents. At the core of CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Scribe is MyScribe, a free downloadable reader that functions as a way to organize and annotate PDFs and other documents (like iTunes, but for documents). It also lets people connect and share documents with other members of the CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Scribe community.  </p>\n\n<p>Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Scribe is a technology company dedicated to helping students and professionals get better, cheaper textbooks that let them learn more efficiently. They recently launched the world&#8217;s first musty-smelling e-books by offering a scratch &amp; sniff sticker that smells like old books with every e-book purchase.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0000/0832/832v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0000/0832/832v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,200],"assets/images/resized/0000/0832/832v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"CafeScribe","permalink":"cafescribe","image":null},{"name":"MyScribe","permalink":"myscribe","image":null},{"name":"Document sharing","permalink":"document-sharing","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bryce","last_name":"Johnson","permalink":"bryce-johnson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/9754/9754v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,160],"assets/images/resized/0000/9754/9754v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,288],"assets/images/resized/0000/9754/9754v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"5320 S. 900 E.
