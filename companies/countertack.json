Each year, more than $24 billion is spent worldwide on security technologies, yet motivated cyber attackers are still finding ways to penetrate the most sophisticated, layered defenses. CounterTack solves this problem by offering the fastest detection and deepest attack intelligence available, enabling customers to actively engage with the attacker and take control over the impact of the attack, even while it is happening.</p>\n\n<p>Founded as NeuralIQ, the company re-launched as CounterTack in 2011, building upon the vision and innovation of NeuralIQ.  Based in Waltham, MA, the privately held company is backed by Fairhaven Capital and a group of private investors.
