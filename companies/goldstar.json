Users can also submit photos of events theyâ€™ve attended, share the events on social networking and social bookmarking sites, search for venue information, print directions, and more. The site creates a customized user experience based on viewing, clicking, and buying behavior.  Goldstar has more than 4000 venue and producer partners in the 25 markets around the country that it serves.</p>\n\n<p>Goldstar recently launched it&#8217;s patent-pending &#8220;Sit with Friends&#8221; feature which allows a person to purchase tickets to an event and forward a unique URL to friends who can purchase their own tickets and be seated all together. This is an industry first.</p>\n\n<p>The Goldstar Advisory Board includes Sean Moriarty, Neil Patrick Harris and Matt Coffin.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/6875/26875v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0002/6875/26875v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0002/6875/26875v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Goldstar","permalink":"goldstar","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CFO and COO","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Webster","permalink":"richard-webster","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"McCarthy","permalink":"jim-mccarthy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/7711/157711v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/7711/157711v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/7711/157711v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Glen DiCrocco</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Graff","permalink":"robert-graff","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Coffin","permalink":"matt-coffin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2010/82010v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,160],"assets/images/resized/0008/2010/82010v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,160],"assets/images/resized/0008/2010/82010v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Mailing Address","address1":"PO Box 277","address2":"","zip_code":"91003","city":"Altadena","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.1897,"longitude":-118.1303}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
