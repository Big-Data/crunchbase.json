Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) is not your typical free dating site, not by a long shot. We came up with meetmyfriend.me because over the years, weâ€™ve had and still do have lots of single friends, single clients, and many of our married friends have single friends. Whatâ€™s the point? Well, to start with, many singles dread the thought of going on any dating site, having to pay good money for it, and having to sift through profiles. Whatâ€™s worse? The first blind date! So much pressure, so much small talk, and probably a meeting between two disingenuous people. Letâ€™s face it, whenever we are about to meet someone new (that could be a love potential) we try to look our best and present our best attributes. Itâ€™s a fact! For every person that signs up on a dating site, there is a person who doesnâ€™t, for the very same reasons mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>For every single friend we have who has tried out a dating site, we have a single friend who cringes at the idea. Thus, Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) was born. We designed it to fill the gap between those who are less shy about joining a dating site, and those who would rather not.</p>\n\n<p>The common denominator amongst all those who really prefer not to join any type of dating site, is that they have no problem to be introduced to other single people by their trusted friends. I mean who knows our likes and dislikes when it comes to a guy or girl better than our friends? Right?! Over the years, our single friends had no problem with us introducing them to another single friend of ours if it was in some type of social gathering. Why? Because the element of a â€˜blind introduction,â€™ or â€˜blind dateâ€™ was not there. There was either instant chemistry or there wasnâ€™t. That is why our concept for Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) is so different from so many of the dating sites out there. We really do take the pressure out of date an put the fun into meet!</p>\n\n<p>Think about it, when youâ€™re at a party or some type of social gathering, the host of the party will generally introduce two of his/her guests who do not know each other, by saying, â€œMeet my friend, Mike.â€ That is exactly the premise behind Meet My Friend! On Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) it is up to the friend to set up a free profile for his/her single friend with the hope that another friend from the near by area has set up a free profile/membership for his/her single friend. If the profiles are a possible match, one friend contacts the other friend who has set up a profile for his/her single friend. Now we just set guidelines, some of your single friends will require that you show them the other personâ€™s profile first, so make sure to do that. The idea is that once the profiles are a deemed a possible â€˜match,â€™ a casual meeting  is set up where hopefully everyone (friends who set up the profiles, as well as the single friend) goes out on the first inroductory outing, removing the awkward â€˜first date,â€˜ or â€˜blind dateâ€™ element. Best case scenario, a love match is made, worst case scenario, new friendships have been formed.</p>\n\n<p>We live in Miami, one of the biggest complaints we hear from people is that they donâ€™t have a lot of friends, or quality friendships. So you see how Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) is really not your typical free dating site? Single friends can count on their friends to scrutinize other profiles before even presenting them with the other single personâ€™s profile, and when a group of people go out for a casual first meeting the possibilities of new friendships formed or new love connections made are endless!!!!!!!!</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™re reminded of the movie When Harry Met Sally, where Meg Ryan, her girlfriend played by Carrie Fisher, Billy Crystal and his friend played by Bruno Kirby, go out on a casual first meeting. The intention was for Meg Ryanâ€™s character and Bruno Kirbyâ€™s character to fall in love happily ever after. Well, it ended up that Bruno Kirbyâ€™s character and Carrie Fisherâ€™s character ended up falling in love and getting married. You never know where life will lead you.</p>\n\n<p>It is our sincere hope that love connections or new friendships are formed as a result of Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me). In the world of such impersonal connections such as texting, e-mailing and digital interactions on other social networks, the sense of human connection has been lost. As human beings, we need warmth, we need human interaction, and most of us have the desire to engage in social gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: For those of you who do not have single friends to set you up on Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me), we invite you to set up your own FREE profile/membership and become apart of the Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) community! Everyone is welcome!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0014/8652/148652v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0014/8652/148652v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,351],"assets/images/resized/0014/8652/148652v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Pfx80CYRVuU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Meet My Friend</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
