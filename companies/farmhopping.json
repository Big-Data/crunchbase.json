We help farmhoppers channel financial contributions and know-how in supporting worldwide sustainable farming. We help them become part of the farms&#8217; everyday life and improve it even without their physical presence onsite.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/0678/220678v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0022/0678/220678v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0022/0678/220678v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rossi","last_name":"Mitova","permalink":"rossi-mitova","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0022/1846/221846v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0022/1846/221846v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,298],"assets/images/resized/0022/1846/221846v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€25k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://blog.eleven.bg/2012/07/31/the-first-11-eleven/","source_description":"THE FIRST 11 @ ELEVEN","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Sofia Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sofia","state_code":null,"country_code":"BGR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0022/1723/221723v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0022/1723/221723v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,132],"assets/images/resized/0022/1723/221723v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
