It&#8217;s a new spin on ridesharing, using social networks to enable real connections. In seconds you can set up a profile, see and book a ride in your area, or post a ride of your own. With Zimride profiles, you can view photos, music and radio preferences to ensure an enjoyable ride.</p>\n\n<p>Zimride is building a marketplace for drivers to sell empty seats in their car by matching them with passengers traveling along the same route.  In addition to public routes, Zimride has an organization-based network approach with over 100 large universities, companies, and event partners paying for the service.  Clients include Stanford, Harvard, all 10 UCs, Intuit, Facebook, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and LiveNation.
