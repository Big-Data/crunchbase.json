In short, what if Apple made Sharepoint instead of Microsoft?</p>\n\n<p>We realized that most companies are using random excel spreadsheets and a loose string of emails to organize + share information such as contacts, files, bug requests, links, and a whole lot more. We built Publictivity as a way to fix this problem, and socially share information with your coworkers. Think of it as Facebook for your own company, but instead of sharing photos, videos, and notes you&#8217;re sharing contacts, files, links,etc. </p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n\n<p>Applets- A simple way to store information in a way that matters to you. A simple roll your own database app to build everything from a bug tracker to product inventory management.</p>\n\n<p>Contacts- Contact management including deduplification. Also includes a company directory.</p>\n\n<p>Buzz tracker- A simple way to have what people are saying about your company in the blogosphere and mainstream media pushed back to you.</p>\n\n<p>Dashboard- Company newsfeed and status updates similar to twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Actions- Task delegation to yourself and other team members.</p>\n\n<p>Wiki Editor- Simple way to collaborate on documents and keep different revisions. This is to google docs as wordpad is to MS Word</p>\n\n<p>Social Bookmarking- Delciious for your own company with a bookmarklet.</p>\n\n<p>File Storage- 2gb of space per user, multiple uploads at a time. Stored on S3</p>\n\n<p>Chat- A built in chat application.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/2719/22719v2-max-150x150.png"],[[204,86],"assets/images/resized/0002/2719/22719v2-max-250x250.png"],[[204,86],"assets/images/resized/0002/2719/22719v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Astor","permalink":"frank-astor","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Baptiste","permalink":"jason-baptiste","image":{"available_sizes":[[[94,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2721/22721v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/2721/22721v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[284,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/2721/22721v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Bob Moreus / [Bob Moreus Photography] (http://www.bobmoreusphotography.com)</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":null,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Silicon Valley","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94306","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.411846,"longitude":-122.1295}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
