It is now a world-renowned ceramics and glass science school, with the only glass science PhD program in the country. The CACT was redesignated by NYS to provide an outcomes-based approach to research. Economic impact to NYS is now built into every new research program.</p>\n\n<p>The focus at Alfred Universityâ€™s CACT is advanced ceramic materials and processing, which include electronic ceramicsâ€¦ high-temperature structural ceramicsâ€¦ photonic ceramics and glassesâ€¦ bioceramics and glassesâ€¦ whitewaresâ€¦ advanced manufacturing processes, including nanostructured processing capabilitiesâ€¦ computer modeling and simulationâ€¦ and electromagnetic processing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/8180/98180v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,99],"assets/images/resized/0009/8180/98180v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,99],"assets/images/resized/0009/8180/98180v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2 Pine St","address2":"","zip_code":"14802","city":"Alfred","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.nystar.state.ny.us/cats.htm","title":"NYSTAR's CAT Program"}]}
