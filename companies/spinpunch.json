Our prototype title, Mars Frontier, is a massively multi-player real time strategy game built in HTML5.</p>\n\n<p>Our backgrounds range from creating Emmy-winning computer graphics and working with Disney, IMAX and NASA, to building world class software in Microsoft Office.</p>\n\n<p>In our spare time, we contribute to the open source community (Linux kernel, ffmpeg video compression), develop visual effects software (used in BattleStar Galactica and Firefly) and avidly play games. Weâ€™re founded by alumni from Stanford, Cornell and Waterloo.
