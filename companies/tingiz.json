Tingiz (from &#8216;thingies&#8217;) connects this world to the physical products themselves, turning each product into a junction between the user, the manufacturer, and the entire web.</p>\n\n<p>The product minisite is managed by the product manufacturer, and is built from a set of modules which are designed specifically to be used for products.\nThe end user finds the QR code (and later on NFC tags will join), and scans it with a standard QR scanner to get to the product minisite.</p>\n\n<p>The Tingiz minisite modules empowers the product usage experience in many aspects, such as:</p>\n\n<p>Community - Discuss with other user of the same product, see which of your friends is using it, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Marcom activities - games, polls, sweepstakes, contests, trivia, tip of the day, etc - all accessible through the product itself.</p>\n\n<p>Support - get manuals, guides, contact customer service, troubleshoot known issues, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Shopping - find local retailers for this product, buy more of it online, buy complementary products, replacement parts, merchandise, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Information - While the product itself has a limited space, the minisite can hold a huge amount of additional information. For example - a food products can contain nutritional info, recipes, cooking tips and more.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing - The user can show off his products by sharing it, or by liking the product/brand page on Facebook</p>\n\n<p>Customer service - a way to contact the product manufacturer with ideas, feedback, complaints and praises.</p>\n\n<p>The product company officers gets:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A new rich, interactive and fun way to deliver their messages.</li>\n<li>detailed statistics regarding the users and their activities.</li>\n<li>Feedback from customers</li>\n<li>Happy (and sharing) customers</li>\n<li>New sales opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tingiz is aimed for product companies of all sizes, from home-businesses who sell hand made products, to global-scale food and electronics product companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0012/9619/129619v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,153],"assets/images/resized/0012/9619/129619v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[346,212],"assets/images/resized/0012/9619/129619v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Eyal","last_name":"Shahar","permalink":"eyal-shahar","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,134],"assets/images/resized/0001/0516/10516v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[197,176],"assets/images/resized/0001/0516/10516v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[197,176],"assets/images/resized/0001/0516/10516v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Exposed on Techonomy3, Tel Aviv","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/05/six-launches-at-techonomy3-the-latest-from-the-nation-of-startups/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Six Launches At #Techonomy3 â€“ The Latest From The Nation Of Startups","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Tingiz","permalink":"tingiz"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/RujeEsbehe4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/RujeEsbehe4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\"></embed></object>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/agvlm0KROOI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/agvlm0KROOI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Techonomy3 presentation</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0012/9617/129617v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,180],"assets/images/resized/0012/9617/129617v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,325],"assets/images/resized/0012/9617/129617v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/9618/129618v2-max-150x150.png"],[[243,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/9618/129618v2-max-250x250.png"],[[438,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/9618/129618v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
