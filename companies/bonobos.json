Launched in 2007 on the Internet with its signature line of better-fitting men&#8217;s pants, Bonobos is now the largest apparel brand ever built on the web in the United States. In 2011 Bonobos extended offline, launching Bonobos Guideshops, an e-commerce showroom that delivers personalized, one-to-one service to those wanting to experience the brand in person.  In 2012, Bonobos expanded its distribution partnering with Nordstrom, bringing Bonobos apparel into select doors nationwide and to Nordstrom.com.</p>\n\n<p>Across channels, Bonobos is focused on delivering a well-targeted brand promise: world-class fit, an innovative shopping experience and an energetic brand spirit. Bonobos was named “One of America’s Hottest Brands” by Advertising Age, “Best Men’s Pants” by New York Magazine, one of Inc. Magazine’s “20 Awesome Facebook Pages” and was awarded  “Best Places to Work” by both Crain’s New York and Outside Magazine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0001/6594/16594v2-max-150x150.png"],[[195,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/6594/16594v2-max-250x250.png"],[[195,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/6594/16594v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Bonobos","permalink":"bonobos","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Dunn","permalink":"andy-dunn","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0020/5313/205313v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0020/5313/205313v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0020/5313/205313v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Hart","permalink":"michael-hart","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0013/4845/134845v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,202],"assets/images/resized/0013/4845/134845v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,364],"assets/images/resized/0013/4845/134845v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Angel Investor","person":{"first_name":"Julie","last_name":"Hanna","permalink":"julie-hanna-ferris","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/1970/121970v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/1970/121970v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[325,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/1970/121970v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor and Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Liew","permalink":"jeremy-liew","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7680/17680v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7680/17680v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7680/17680v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Spaly","permalink":"brian-spaly","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief of Staff","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Eisenberg","permalink":"dave-eisenberg","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$38.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2009/04/fancy_trousers.html","source_description":"Wall Street Journal","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":22,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Stage One Capital","permalink":"stage-one-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0008/3986/83986v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0008/3986/83986v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,167],"assets/images/resized/0008/3986/83986v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Stage One Capital","permalink":"stage-one-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0008/3986/83986v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0008/3986/83986v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,167],"assets/images/resized/0008/3986/83986v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/bonobos-raises-18-5-million-metrosexuals-unite/","source_description":"Bonobos Raises $18.5 Million.
