Legacy APIs distribute data in the provider&#8217;s format which makes it difficult to integrate with the subscriber&#8217;s internal databases which are usually in a different format. With Saturn, you can push information in whatever format you&#8217;re using, and your subscribers can receive real-time updates in whatever custom format they need.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0009/9184/99184v2-max-150x150.png"],[[205,58],"assets/images/resized/0009/9184/99184v2-max-250x250.png"],[[205,58],"assets/images/resized/0009/9184/99184v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Saturn - cloud data management & exchange service for local business data","permalink":"saturn-cloud-data-management-exchange-service-for-local-business-data","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Grant","last_name":"Ritchie","permalink":"grant-ritchie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO & EVP","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Servos","permalink":"dan-servos","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Project Manager","person":{"first_name":"Shael","last_name":"Green","permalink":"shael-green","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/07/locationary-secures-2-5m-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Locationary Secures $2.5M in Funding","raised_amount":2500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":28,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Trellis Capital","permalink":"trellis-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[71,136],"assets/images/resized/0010/3939/103939v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[71,136],"assets/images/resized/0010/3939/103939v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[71,136],"assets/images/resized/0010/3939/103939v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Extreme Venture Partners","permalink":"extreme-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/4633/84633v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0008/4633/84633v1-max-250x250.png"],[[302,103],"assets/images/resized/0008/4633/84633v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Plazacorp Ventures","permalink":"plazacorp-ventures","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund","permalink":"mars-investment-accelerator-fund","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"MaRS IAF","permalink":"mars-iaf","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"400-312 Adelaide St. West","address2":"","zip_code":"M5V 1R2","city":"Toronto, ON","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0009/9183/99183v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0009/9183/99183v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0009/9183/99183v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
