Soon to be launched in New York, London and Oslo.</p>\n\n<p>RÃ¤ttvisefÃ¶rmedlingen (The Equality Agency) helps media and others find alternatives to the norm for participation in TV programs, interviews, history books, debates, events and more. The rapidly growing Facebook and Web-based organization, consisting of more than 20 000 volonteers, will for example, suggest a man who can speak about parenting, or an expert for a panel which otherwose would only consist of men. Especially media has praised this initiative, for making it easier not to fall into tiresome everyday choises that lessen peoples chances to do what they want, without regards to their sex, age, looks and where they come from.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Bias in the portrayal of women and men in news content has a detrimental impact on the public&#8217;s perception of gender roles in society,&#8221; says Aidan White, IFJ General Secretary, commenting on the results of a report by the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) that shows that only 24% of people in news media over the world are women. &#8220;This report concludes that media around the world is failing to portray fairly more than a half of the world&#8217;s population.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>â€œToday, the media perpetuates the old stereotypes of men and women and we want to break old prejudices. All the people sitting on an expert panel do not have to be white men who speak perfect Swedish,â€ says Lina ThomsgÃ¥rd, founder of RÃ¤ttvisefÃ¶rmedlingen.</p>\n\n<p>Find RÃ¤ttvisefÃ¶rmedlingen here:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/rattviseformedlingen\nand here:\nhttp://www.rattviseformedlingen.se</p>\n\n<p>Some international words written about us:</p>\n\n<p>RÃ„TTVISEFÃ–RMEDLINGEN</p>\n\n<p>According to the Global Gender Gap Report in 2009, Sweden is the worldâ€™s fourth most equal country in terms of gender. Great news! â€“ But it doesnâ€™t mean that weâ€™re satisfied. The equality project RÃ¤ttvisefÃ¶rmedlingen (Corporation of Justice) initiated by Lina ThomsgÃ¥rd, is a brand-new affiliation working for balanced opportunities between men and woman. Its main mission is to steer people away from tiresome and repetitive everyday choices, and make way for new possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>In their own words they â€œhelp those with difficulties of finding women to participate in their projects; interviews, tv programs, lectures, musical events, award shows.. etc.â€\nRight now the website provides long lists of female artists, copywriters, directors, comedians and DJs â€“ and more content is added by the minute! And speaking of DJing, besides working for equality, Lina is also a member of the award-winning Dj collective Chapel Hill Crew. Itâ€™s just a crying shame that theyâ€™re called a â€œfemaleâ€ collective.\nWhile guys? Well, theyâ€™re just â€œDJsâ€. These are exactly the kinds of boring labels that RÃ¤ttvisefÃ¶rmedlingen is trying to get rid of.</p>\n\n<p>The Swede Beat #14\nhttp://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=80b566c77cc8873e0857b5dea&amp;id=68a16cf016&amp;e=3c99ae3054</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0010/8728/108728v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0010/8728/108728v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0010/8728/108728v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"FRAU ","permalink":"frau","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/rattviseformedlingen","title":"RÃ¤ttvisefÃ¶rmedlingen on Facebook"}]}
