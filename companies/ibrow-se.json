So, not only is it easier to shop at your favorite stores, but it&#8217;s also easy to discover new favorite stores from the thousands of amazing online stores out there, where you can find great products for yourself or gifts for friends and family.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Berg","permalink":"josh-berg","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
