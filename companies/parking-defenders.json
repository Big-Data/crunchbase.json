Choose a driver that is interested to park in the area and once you are ready to depart the application will guide him to your spot. \nFor every offer, you earn points that you can use to claim other parking spots. </p>\n\n<p>While the app regards almost every urban citizen we plan to expand one city at a time and hope to see you as a defender \nwhen the app becomes available at your location.</p>\n\n<p>Available for Android, iPhone and Windows Phone!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1748/161748v6-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/1748/161748v6-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/1748/161748v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Konstantinos","last_name":"Arkadas","permalink":"konstantinos-arkadas","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Katsiotis","permalink":"john-katsiotis","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/3135/163135v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/3135/163135v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/3135/163135v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"iPhone Developer","person":{"first_name":"Otto","last_name":"Antoniou","permalink":"otto-antoniou","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Open Spot","permalink":"open-spot","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Roadify","permalink":"roadify","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"ShareMySpot","permalink":"sharemyspot","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Profile Defenders","permalink":"profile-defenders","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0015/1658/151658v2-max-150x150.png"],[[212,103],"assets/images/resized/0015/1658/151658v2-max-250x250.png"],[[212,103],"assets/images/resized/0015/1658/151658v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"â‚¬18k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://aegean-startups.blogspot.com/","source_description":"Best business plan at Aegean Startups entrepreneurial competition","raised_amount":15000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"TANEO fund","permalink":"taneo-fund","image":null},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://opencoffee.gr/2012/04/10/mobip/","source_description":"Mobip","raised_amount":3000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Globo","permalink":"globo","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[72,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1745/161745v2-max-150x150.png"],[[120,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/1745/161745v2-max-250x250.png"],[[217,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/1745/161745v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[74,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1746/161746v2-max-150x150.png"],[[124,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/1746/161746v2-max-250x250.png"],[[223,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/1746/161746v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[80,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1747/161747v2-max-150x150.png"],[[133,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/1747/161747v2-max-250x250.png"],[[240,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/1747/161747v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
