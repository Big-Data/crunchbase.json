Chloe + Isabel has developed a platform that powers a seller&#8217;s personal e-commerce experience. Users who sign up as Merchandisers receive a customized digital workplace to create their boutique shopping experience, and earn commission from every sale. Merchandisers may participate in streaming video training, are able to curate personal collections of Chloe + Isabel jewelry on their online boutiques, and receive real-time trends, insights and recommendations to help support their businesses. </p>\n\n<p>Chloe + Isabel founder and CEO Chantel Waterbury has over 14 years of expert experience developing jewelry for major retailers in the United States, including Target Corp, Macy&#8217;s, Gap Inc, LVMH and Kenneth Cole. Waterbury, who supported herself through college by direct-selling, says she made the jump from working for multi-billion dollar retailers to launching a startup so she could empower the next generation of women.  </p>\n\n<p>In November 2011, Chloe + Isabel raised a $8.5 million Series A round of funding, led by General Catalyst Partners. Lead investors from the company&#8217;s seed financing, including First Round Capital, also participated in this round. </p>\n\n<p>In January 2011, Chloe + Isabel raised $3.25 million in a seed round led by First Round Capital, Floodgate Fund, and angel investors including SV Angel Ron Conway, Founder Collective&#8217;s Caterina Fake, Felicis Ventures&#8217; Aydin Senkut, The Consigliere&#8217;s
