Simply, it is social networking with a purpose. Existing social networks like Facebook® and LinkedIn® show only what that person wants you to see. They are a form of self-flattery. Catchabody allows you to create the content on a person&#8217;s page and, in doing that, we feel you can help stop the proliferation of bad behavior. </p>\n\n<p>How will this happen? Many of us Google search people we come in contact with and look through the first page search results to see if we can get a glimpse into what that person is about. With that in mind, if someone has done you wrong, let the world know about it so they can&#8217;t do it again. By creating a page for them, or posting on an existing page, you can help others not suffer the same as you did. It is your small way of helping change the world for the better. The next time someone Googles their name, your content will be there (keep in mind it takes a few days for it to show up on search engines). </p>\n\n<p>Catchabody.com is owned and operated by Tappan St. Inc. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0021/1745/211745v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0021/1745/211745v2-max-250x250.png"],[[260,57],"assets/images/resized/0021/1745/211745v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
