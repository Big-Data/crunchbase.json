More than 100 million immigration forms are filed each year in the U.S., with any one person filing multiple forms over a number of years as his or her status changes. clearpath’s patented software was developed by former U.S. immigration agency leaders who understand how to navigate the government’s complex system. Our simple online solution offers all the most requested forms including citizenship, deferred action for childhood arrivals, H1-B visa, work authorization, green card, etc. Using plain language, clearpath walks a user, step-by-step, through each form, checking data in real time for potential errors and compliance. clearpath’s solution is easy, secure and affordable, costing roughly one-tenth of the fees charged by lawyers or notarios. This venture-backed technology company was founded in 2008 by Chairman Michael J. Petrucelli, former deputy director and acting director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
