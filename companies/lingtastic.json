Or, you are planning an activity (trip, conference call, etc.) where you would need on-demand translation services for a reasonable price (80% less than current rates)? That is what Lingtastic is all about, via any voice (landline, cell, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/skype\" title=\"Skype\">Skype</a>, other VoIP), messaging (Skype, all IM services, SMS), and social networking applications (<a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> now; <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/linkdin\" title=\"LinkdIn\">LinkdIn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/opensocial-foundation\" title=\"OpenSocial\">OpenSocial</a> in development) communications channel our web application will provide a linkup between the party requiring translation services and our body of fully vetted translators (massive community interest, 200 registered &amp; graded, 2k in-queue to be vetted by existing &#8220;Masters,&#8221; 30 applicants a day) at the exact expertise level / price-point required by the situation using a transaction based payment model (subscriber <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/paypal\" title=\"PayPal\">PayPal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> or Credit Cards; real-time pay-as-you-go anticipated). Our application (patent pending) is up and running, has had a very successful private beta test, and is ready to launch NOW. Our value proposition is that by bringing together an active community of vetted and graded translators, competing for transactions in a free-market  by using their own computers and our software to establish the communication links we can scale massively while still offering the most competitive pricing available.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/1636/21636v1-max-150x150.png"],[[198,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1636/21636v1-max-250x250.png"],[[198,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1636/21636v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Chas","last_name":"Watkins","permalink":"chas-watkins","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/lingtastic/","title":"Launch closed beta"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/eCommerce/Lingtasticcom---Almost-Free-Translation/","title":"Launch"},{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2008/06/12/lingtastic-sms-translation/","title":"SMS translation"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEamJV_Y9ZM","title":"Video Pitch"}]}
