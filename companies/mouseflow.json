It is a hosted service that can be used on any publicly facing website.</p>\n\n<p>Mouseflow records whole visitor sessions including mouse movements, clicks, scroll events and key strokes. Website administrators can play back the visitor sessions directly in the browser, just as if they were looking the user over the shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>By summarizing large amounts of data from the recorded visits Mouseflow also give web administrators access to advanced page analysis including Click Heatmaps, Viewport Maps (displaying scroll behavior) as well as stats and graphs of many different parameters. Mouseflow can help web administrators pinpoint pages where users are having trouble, pages that respond or render slowly, pages where only few users scroll down to the bottom, pages with high bounce rate, and much more. You can also live stream current visitors on your website, e.g. for big screens.</p>\n\n<p>Mouseflow can be used to perform large automated user studies that are cheap and easy to deploy. The playback and web analytics tools can be used to discover problematic parts of a website and to discover ways of increasing conversion rates and minimizing abandon rates, thereby making more money. The boardroom-ready statistical data, heatmaps and graphs can be used to get an overall idea about how users interact with the site.</p>\n\n<p>Setup only requires one line of javascript, and takes a few minutes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0009/5331/95331v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0009/5331/95331v2-max-250x250.png"],[[346,74],"assets/images/resized/0009/5331/95331v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"userfly.com","permalink":"userfly-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Office","address1":"Postboks 131","address2":"","zip_code":"1004 ","city":"Copenhagen","state_code":null,"country_code":"DNK","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/mouseflow-com-analyzing-the-behavior-of-visitors","title":"Review at KillerStartups.com"}]}
