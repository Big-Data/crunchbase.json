Owners earn money while saving on airport parking, and renters choose from a wider selection of vehicles at lower prices than those offered by the major car rental chains. A similar peer-to-peer car sharing model successfully exists at a local level, where owners rent out their vehicles to neighbors. FlightCar is the first to bring this model to airports in order to serve air travelers. All rentals are insured with a comprehensive $1 million policy that protects both owners and renters.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rujul","last_name":"Zaparde","permalink":"rujul-zaparde","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Petrovic","permalink":"kevin-petrovic","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Shri","last_name":"Ganeshram","permalink":"shri-ganeshram","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$20k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"http://brandery.org","source_description":"The Brandery","raised_amount":20000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"The Brandery","permalink":"the-brandery","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0016/6437/166437v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0016/6437/166437v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0016/6437/166437v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1411 Vine Street","address2":"","zip_code":"45202","city":"Cincinnati","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/brandery/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://betakit.com/2012/10/01/flightcar-launching-peer-to-peer-car-rental-service-targeted-at-travelers","title":""}]}
