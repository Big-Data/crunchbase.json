It is a free Q&amp;A collective that specializes in getting fast answers from the right people.</p>\n\n<p>It accepts questions on any subject, and has a few key differences from other Q&amp;A sites:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Technology: Fluther&#8217;s matching algorithm sends personalized questions to every user based on their expertise and site usage. It also features real-time interaction, so you can receive answers and follow-up live; each question feels like its own chat room.</p></li>\n<li><p>Community: Fluther has a high bar for quality and community interaction. There is a team of volunteer moderators to enforce the guidelines, and there are no external incentives for submitting questions and answers (besides increasing your &#8220;lurve&#8221; score). This leads to a relatively high level of discourse, and a close-knit community. Each user can also follow their own &#8220;fluther&#8221; of interesting people, enabling more filtering and less noise.</p></li>\n<li><p>Design: Fluther has a quirky and humorous voice, and an ornate design that has been carefully crafted.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Fluther also has an iPhone web application which allows users to get answers wherever they are.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/3844/23844v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,135],"assets/images/resized/0002/3844/23844v2-max-250x250.png"],[[251,136],"assets/images/resized/0002/3844/23844v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
