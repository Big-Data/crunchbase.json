Established in early 2008, Scraster remains one of very few dedicated screencast production houses.  Most of Scraster&#8217;s clients are small-to-midsize software firms looking to extend their marketing reach with slick demonstrations of their products or services.  A number of other clients appreciate what Scraster&#8217;s tutorial vids do to minimize support calls for FAQs.</p>\n\n<p>Scraster recently turned its attention to the production of iPhone app demo videos and is the only professional screencast production service advertising videos produced in an  ideal simulation of the iPhone environment.  The Scraster team has managed to work out all the kinks that plague amateur producers struggling with the SDK&#8217;s simulator and the popular-but-janky SimFinger toolkit.
