She has too much to do during the day and doesnâ€™t have time to sort through all the emails from The Baby Gap and The Limited and J Crew so instead of looking at them at all, she deletes everything.  She needs WIP - one information stream, no email clutter, clean and simple to use.</p>\n\n<p>Scenario #2 is the infrequent buyer.  This person is interested in ecommerce communication but only at certain times.  They want the communication but they want to be in control of what and when.  They like REI and their product line but donâ€™t want emails from them every day or week and donâ€™t care enough to friend them on Facebook or follow on Twitter.  They book airline flights 4-5 times a year but donâ€™t want Travelocity emails clogging inboxes and CANâ€™T even connect to them on Facebook or Twitter.  They likewise donâ€™t want to constantly go back to Travelocity and enter new flight information every time.  The infrequent buyer needs WIP to stay on top of the commercial information at times when itâ€™s important and not have to see it when itâ€™s not.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0006/2154/62154v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,125],"assets/images/resized/0006/2154/62154v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,125],"assets/images/resized/0006/2154/62154v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"michael-patterson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jafer","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"jafer-patterson","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing Manager","person":{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"Ciolino","permalink":"valentina-ciolino","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/4324/124324v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/4324/124324v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[301,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/4324/124324v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Twitter","permalink":"twitter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Ebates","permalink":"ebates","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/2429/82429v2-max-150x150.png"],[[120,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/2429/82429v2-max-250x250.png"],[[120,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/2429/82429v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Yotify","permalink":"yotify","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0006/2153/62153v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0006/2153/62153v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,268],"assets/images/resized/0006/2153/62153v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
