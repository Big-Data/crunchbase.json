It’s kind of like Facebook, but instead of friends – it’s a filtered group of Vendor feeds on a Social Wall.</p>\n\n<p>Channel Partners will have a single place to see a snapshot of new channel information every day.  You’ll cut through the noise and clutter because you control who you follow, filter the relevant information and build social conversations around it.</p>\n\n<p>Vendors, manufacturers and distributors of all types will have a single place to engage with your entire channel, targeting the right person with the right information at the right time.  The net result is better engagement, sell-through, and access to potential new partners.</p>\n\n<p>ChannelEyes is a ridiculously simple way to organize your business partnerships, saving time and allowing you to take advantage of timely information.  </p>\n\n<p>Join today at:  http://www.channeleyes.com</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Godgart","permalink":"bob-godgart","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"573 Columbia Turnpike","address2":"Suite 3B","zip_code":"12061","city":"East Greenbush","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[142,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/1023/191023v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/1023/191023v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[428,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/1023/191023v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.mspmentor.net/2011/09/30/former-auotask-ceo-launches-channeleyes-social-network/","title":"Former Autotask CEO Launches ChannelEyes Social Network"},{"external_url":"http://bsminfo.com/doc.mvc/ChannelEyes-Creating-The-First-Secure-Social-0001","title":"ChannelEyes Creating The First Secure Social Network For The Channel"},{"external_url":"http://www.channelinsider.com/c/a/Spotlight/ChannelEyes-Wants-to-Be-Facebook-for-the-Channel-194815/","title":"ChannelEyes Wants to Be Facebook for the Channel"},{"external_url":"http://channelnomics.com/2011/09/30/godgart-starts-batting-%E2%80%98channeleyes%E2%80%99/","title":"Godgart Starts Batting His ‘ChannelEyes’"},{"external_url":"http://www.channelprosmb.com/article/26028/ChannelEyes-Brings-Social-Networking-to-the-Channel/","title":"ChannelEyes Brings Social Networking to the Channel"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osNy5lm8i6Y","title":"SMB Nation interviews ChannelEyes"}]}
