Although services are offered a &#8216;la carte, the firm often strongly encourages clients to consider the other services in order to aid efforts.</p>\n\n<p>The firm&#8217;s CEO, Ilan Nass, argues that singular services (such as networking via Facebook) are ineffectual in building brand images online.  With 97% of consumers researching online before making a purchase decision, Taktical attempts to achieve a full spectrum of image building services under one roof.</p>\n\n<p>Taktical&#8217;s client list is mostly confidential, although several national brands are rumored to be paying customers.  Clients of Taktical regularly see increases in Facebook and Twitter followers in the thousands per month.  They are one of the only firms in the world capable of guaranteeing increases such as these.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0014/7512/147512v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0014/7512/147512v2-max-250x250.png"],[[275,71],"assets/images/resized/0014/7512/147512v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ilan","last_name":"Nass","permalink":"ilan-nass","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Long Island Office","address1":"747 Middle Neck Road","address2":"Suite 108","zip_code":"11024","city":"Great Neck","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"New York City","address1":"184 Fifth Ave","address2":"3rd Floor","zip_code":"10011","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
