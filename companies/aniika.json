For our sellers, we promote design entrepreneurship by providing them a platform to brand and sell their products to a large international consumer base with minimal operational hassles.</p>\n\n<p>Aniika currently showcases designers who create jewelry, personal accessories and home decor. </p>\n\n<p>Much like the platform&#8217;s look and feel, Aniika is focused on products that are moored in Indian tradition yet alive to a contemporary, global aesthetic. This unique combination of\ntraditional and modern design gives the buyers, who are familiar with Indian handicrafts, an opportunity to own products that are different from the stereotype of Indian\nhandicrafts. Distinct from other online marketplaces, we take our curating process very seriously. We are strong advocators of unique design and quality over quantity.</p>\n\n<p>We aim to be ‘The curated bazaar’ to virtually buy and sell designer lifestyle products from a ‘New India’.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0019/8413/198413v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0019/8413/198413v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,162],"assets/images/resized/0019/8413/198413v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Meghana","last_name":"Rao","permalink":"meghana-rao","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Shamim","last_name":"T","permalink":"shamim-t","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/07/aniika-raises-500k-angel-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Aniika Raises $500K in Angel Funding","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":30,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Aniika","address1":"Oculus Work Spaces","address2":"#66/1, 2nd Floor, Coles Road","zip_code":"560005","city":"Bangalore","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0019/8412/198412v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,134],"assets/images/resized/0019/8412/198412v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,242],"assets/images/resized/0019/8412/198412v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
