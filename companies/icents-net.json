It lets web developers use JavaScript and Ajax to integrate payments deep within the website&#8217;s strategy. It allows people to use the payment systems they already have, like PayPal, Amazon Payments and Google Checkout, among others. </p>\n\n<p>iCents.net streamlines the user experience, instead of interrupting what he or she is doing to start a payment process, and ensures that the user&#8217;s experience is never disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>It is the first payment tool that reduces the so-called &#8220;mental transaction costs,&#8221; meaning that payments using iCents require a low mental effort. This makes selling premium content easier by orders of magnitude, because the mental effort of making the payment decision itself is commonly considered the real barrier to paying for content, more so than price. </p>\n\n<p>iCents.net is designed for selling premium content in mostly-free websites, under the &#8220;Freemium&#8221; business model, and provides an extra revenue model for a great number of Web 2.0 companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,59],"assets/images/resized/0002/3728/23728v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,59],"assets/images/resized/0002/3728/23728v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,59],"assets/images/resized/0002/3728/23728v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Glasberg","permalink":"marc-glasberg","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Simoes","permalink":"marco-simoes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Vianna","permalink":"edward-vianna","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":4200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
