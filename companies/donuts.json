The company is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, with offices in Los Angeles and Washington, DC.</p>\n\n<p>On June 5, 2012, Donuts announced that, as part of ICANN’s new TLD program, it has moved assertively to expand Internet namespace with 307 applications for new and varied TLDs in various character sets.  The expansion will bring new industry competition and new choices for Internet end-users who need better, more specific domain names for their products and services.</p>\n\n<p>Donuts’ initial funding totals more than $100 million in capital from multi-billion dollar private equity and venture funds.  Executives indicate they intend to deploy the capital, and raise additional funding if necessary, to secure each applied-for TLD.</p>\n\n<p>The company’s funding sources include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Austin Ventures</li>\n<li>Adams Street Partners</li>\n<li>Emergence Capital Partners</li>\n<li>TL Ventures</li>\n<li>Generation Partners</li>\n<li>Stahurricane (CEO Paul Stahura’s private investment fund)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Donuts also obtained a senior secured revolving credit facility with Comerica Bank.</p>\n\n<p>Donuts was founded by Paul Stahura, Richard Tindal, Jonathon Nevett and Daniel Schindler—four industry veterans with extensive experience in registry and registrar operations and industry governance, and who have successfully launched TLDs, built industry-leading companies, and brought value and choice to the domain name marketplace.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0019/4113/194113v1-max-150x150.png"],[[193,50],"assets/images/resized/0019/4113/194113v1-max-250x250.png"],[[193,50],"assets/images/resized/0019/4113/194113v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder
