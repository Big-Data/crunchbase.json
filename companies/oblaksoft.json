OblaskSoft offers ClouSE â€“ a technology that allows cloud storage to be &#8220;plugged into&#8221; MySQL in a seamless and secure manner.</p>\n\n<p>ClouSE is the Cloud Storage Engine for MySQL that can utilize cloud storage such as Amazon S3 to store relational and blob data.  ClouSE provides fully functional, transactional and ACID-compliant relational data management on top of cloud storage.</p>\n\n<p>Key advantages of ClouSE include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It provides transactional (ACID) guarantees to the users, with transactions featuring commit, rollback, and crash-recovery capabilities to protect user data</li>\n<li>It allows utilizing cloud storage to store user data</li>\n<li>It supports on-the-fly encryption of user data to guarantee its full confidentiality in the cloud</li>\n<li>It supports direct access to blob content (a.k.a. weblobs) to enable scaling out content delivery of large data objects (e.g. pictures, movies)</li>\n<li>It supports public, private and hybrid cloud configurations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Designed and optimized for cloud storage from ground up ClouSE uses eventual consistency management, compression and caching techniques to smooth out cloud storage adoption bumps such as non-strict data consistency, high-latency storage access, and higher storage access failure rate due to network failures.  As a transactional storage engine for MySQL ClouSE opens cloud storage to SQL developers and SQL-based applications and reduces the need to retrain developers and rewrite applications to use new data processing paradigms, thus lowering the barrier for cloud storage adoption.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0016/9811/169811v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,228],"assets/images/resized/0016/9811/169811v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,274],"assets/images/resized/0016/9811/169811v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Cloud Storage Engine (ClouSE)","permalink":"cloud-storage-engine-clouse","image":null},{"name":"WebStor","permalink":"webstor","image":null},{"name":"Yapixx - WordPress on S3","permalink":"yapixx-wordpress-on-s3","image":null},{"name":"WP2Cloud - WordPress to Cloud","permalink":"wp2cloud-wordpress-to-cloud","image":null},{"name":"ClouSE","permalink":"clouse","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder","person":{"first_name":"Artem","last_name":"Livshits","permalink":"artem-livshits","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder","person":{"first_name":"Artem","last_name":"Livshits","permalink":"artem-livshits-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
