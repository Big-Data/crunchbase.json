The service supports companies multiple contact channels to ensure the consumer’s voice is heard. </p>\n\n<p>Nevahold receives a question or complaint from a consumer and posts it to the respective company’s customer support channels being Facebook, Twitter, email or any other support channel. The consumer goes about her daily activities and receives a response from the company through nevahold. If the brand does not respond to the consumer within a certain time frame nevaHold blasts the company on all of its social media networks until there is a response. </p>\n\n<p>Now instead of a consumer spending 30 minutes on hold for a customer support agent or searching online forums for an answer, she spends less than a minute to make her voice heard. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0021/6024/216024v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0021/6024/216024v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,203],"assets/images/resized/0021/6024/216024v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Kena","last_name":"Amoah","permalink":"kena-amoah","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/0059/200059v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/0059/200059v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/0059/200059v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Development Lead","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Tetteh","permalink":"david-tetteh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/0489/200489v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/0489/200489v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/0489/200489v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David Tetteh</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Exuvf_27fDk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Exuvf_27fDk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>How nevaHold works in 90seconds</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Exuvf_27fDk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Exuvf_27fDk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"450\" height=\"315\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>How nevaHold works in 90seconds</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0019/1936/191936v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0019/1936/191936v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0019/1936/191936v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://nevahold.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/nevahold","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/neva_hold","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://startuptunes.com/2012/07/09/nevahold-changing-conventional-customer-service/","title":""}]}
