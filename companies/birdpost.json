Birdpost combines satellite mapping technology with the popular sport of birdwatching, dramatically modernizing, improving, and altering the hobby by solving birders&#8217; most vexing problem: where to find new bird species. Birdpost gives the estimated 18 million serious U.S. birders an online platform to chronicle, organize, map, and share their collective birding activities.</p>\n\n<p>The cumulative data gathered by Birdpost&#8217;s users will produce &#8220;natural histories&#8221; of local habitats and give conservationists, educators, and other nature enthusiasts the tools they need to better protect, understand, and the enjoy the environment. Ultimately, Birdpost&#8217;s proprietary vehicle for grass-roots nature reporting will scale beyond birds to include other nature verticals such as wildlife, insects, reptiles, plants, fish, and trees, becoming a human-generated nature search engine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/4789/24789v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/4789/24789v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/4789/24789v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Peery","permalink":"jason-peery-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Crockett","permalink":"ben-crockett","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$350k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Self Funded by parent company, Foglight Group","raised_amount":350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Menlo Park, CA","address1":"644 Menlo #201","address2":"","zip_code":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.452011,"longitude":-122.182824}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object id=\"otv_o_297294\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\"  classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param value=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/702842\" name=\"movie\" /><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\" /><param value=\"always\" name=\"allowScriptAccess\" /><param value=\"transparent\" name=\"wmode\" /><param value=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" name=\"flashvars\" /><embed name=\"otv_e_429560\" id=\"otv_e_382385\" flashvars=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/702842\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /></object>","description":"<p>TC50</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
