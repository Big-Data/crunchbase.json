VolantÃ©&#8217;s cutting edge software offers unrivaled ease of use and reliability through a network of peer to peer terminals. </p>\n\n<p>Not basing the system on the traditional Server/Client model, VolantÃ© uses the power of distributed computing with peer to peer technology. Peer to peer decentralizes the responsibilities customarily given to the server and distributes the task among the peers. All clients have the ability to publish services and instead of requesting a server to perform work, clients can request the work to be done by any of its peers. Thus a server is not even required for normal client operations. </p>\n\n<p>VolantÃ© understands that your system cannot cause your business to halt. Servers go down, networks disconnect, and these events can happen at any given time. VolantÃ© was designed to operate without any of these components. </p>\n\n<p>VolantÃ© also believes it is important to deliver POS systems that can evolve over time as new application ideas and hardware devices come to the fore. Application systems can no longer be, simply, point-in-time products. Data will need to be handled in common ways in robust communication environments. Application systems will need to be built around open standards to keep both costs down and integration seamless. They will have to become cross-platform compatible and operate in mixed environments with the greatest degree of fault tolerance, data integrity, and do this as transparently as possible for the user.</p>\n\n<p>Great opportunities lie in a technology developerâ€™s ability to design and deliver systems that will preserve end usersâ€™ investments in technological evolution and maximize ROI in the process.</p>\n\n<p>VolantÃ© Features:</p>\n\n<p>Point of Sale (POS)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Customizable floor plans</li>\n<li>Table management to seat level</li>\n<li>Real time table status</li>\n<li>Check splitting by seat or by item</li>\n<li>Table and Tab access from any terminal</li>\n<li>Unlimited price level configurations</li>\n<li>Quick bar speed board feature</li>\n<li>Multiple currencies and languages</li>\n<li>Logo or message on receipts</li>\n<li>Customer tab tracking</li>\n<li>Easy transferring of tabs to tables</li>\n<li>Menu item countdown</li>\n<li>Unlimited payment types</li>\n<li>Full coursing, hold and fire</li>\n<li>Time and attendance</li>\n<li>Customizable user security</li>\n<li>Unlimited configurable job positions</li>\n<li>Multiple job positions per employee</li>\n<li>Management override</li>\n<li>Alerts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Customer Relationship Management</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Preferred customer discounts</li>\n<li>Customer loyalty points program</li>\n<li>Customer transaction history including Photo ID</li>\n<li>Loadable and re-loadable customer accounts</li>\n<li>Loadable and re-loadable gift cards</li>\n<li>Customer tab tracking</li>\n<li>Customer preferences ranking</li>\n<li>Sports team sponsorship and tracking</li>\n<li>Meal plans</li>\n<li>Coupons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reporting</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standard predefined reports</li>\n<li>Time dependent sales volume</li>\n<li>Tracking by group, category, item, terminal, employee</li>\n<li>Tracking by number, region, store, sales type</li>\n<li>User defined repots;
