Each time the user logs in to the In &amp; Out application, their account data is refreshed and displayed on their â€œDashboardâ€ which gives the user an at-a-glance visual of their total cash, summary of their financial health, and their net worth.  </p>\n\n<p>But unlike our competition, we didnâ€™t stop there.  We made In &amp; Out â€˜smartâ€™ by creating a custom financial health algorithm to calculate the userâ€™s overall financial health based on 8 different criteria: Survival Cash Health, Savings Cash Health, Savings Kept, Income to Debt Ratio, Credit Balances to Limits Ratio, Credit Spending, Survival Spending, and Personal Spending to Savings Ratio.  Using the best financial practices advised by credit reporting agencies, lending institutions, and proven lean management principles, In &amp; Out analyzes each category and gives a health rating of Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor, as well as an Overall Financial Health score.  Each time the userâ€™s account data is refreshed, In &amp; Out will automatically categorize the new transactions and recalculate each financial health rating.  The user can click on â€œMy Coachâ€ to view details on an Overall Financial Health Report. With this systematic approach to financial health we can calculate where the user needs to be in each category, and how to take the next steps towards financial excellence.   We even have integrated video coaching specific to each health category that will help the user understand how to improve their current rating.  We utilize avatar imagery to deliver our coaching in a fun, non-threatening way, while still maintaining the seriousness and substantive tone needed to improve our clients financial success.  </p>\n\n<p>Also providing a key tool for debt elimination, the Pay with Purpose Debt Eliminator feature tells users the exact sequence to pay their debts in order to eliminate them as quickly as possible to save more money and improve their financial health scores. Along with Pay with Purpose, users can receive notifications and alerts when charged fees and when any of their health ratings change.  In addition, we will continually create user-friendly tools to ensure success including an automated to-do list system, bill payment reminders, email and text alerts, goals planning, and budgets.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0007/7389/77389v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,110],"assets/images/resized/0007/7389/77389v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,199],"assets/images/resized/0007/7389/77389v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"E.
