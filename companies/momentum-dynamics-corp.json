The company is developing a unique and proprietary technology system that will permit electrically powered vehicles to be recharged without the use of a wire. This wireless technology is revolutionary because it can be operated automatically, allowing both passenger-class and commercial fleet vehicles to be charged safely and effortlessly in all weather and without direct supervision.  Operating software developed by Momentum Dynamics allows the system to automatically identify equipped vehicles and regulate the sale of power in a manner similar to Automatic Toll Collection Systems (such as EZ-Pass and FasTrack).  When used with large commercial vehicles where rapid charging is often important, the system can recharge a vehicle using lower voltage systems (240V) much more rapidly than a comparable plug-in charger.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0019/7138/197138v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0019/7138/197138v1-max-250x250.png"],[[292,105],"assets/images/resized/0019/7138/197138v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Daga","permalink":"andrew-daga","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Infrastructure Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Zeyn","last_name":"B.
