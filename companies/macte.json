But Safari has suffered from one distinct disadvantage when compared to its big rivals: a lack of add-ons.</p>\n\n<p>With no official extensions architecture available for Safari, creating dedicated add-ons such as toolbars has been virtually impossible beyond simple hacks â€“ meaning Appleâ€™s browser has been unable to match the customization potential of Internet Explorer and Firefox, which both offer hundreds of extensions.</p>\n\n<p>Now Macte! has raised the bar for Safari functionality as a proof of concept â€“ and can, for the first time, offer your business its own customized Safari add-on.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/9074/39074v2-max-150x150.png"],[[138,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/9074/39074v2-max-250x250.png"],[[138,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/9074/39074v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Macte!
