It&#8217;s how people and ideas connect. </p>\n\n<p>Siminars keeps people interested in ideas by breaking content down into bite sized pieces, offering a fun user experience that rewards engagement, and a built-in social communiy that encourages involvement.</p>\n\n<p>Siminars fills a void in the market of publishing and presentation tools. Existing tools are either too complex for mass adoption (think e-learning platforms) or too simple to be effectively in keeping someone interested and engaged as they explore new ideas (think Powerpoint) </p>\n\n<p>The company has three different products:</p>\n\n<p>Open Siminars are free to make, and free to take. They are ideal to help promote an idea, a product, a person, or a brand.</p>\n\n<p>Retail Siminars are for premium ideas and allow content creators to productive their content. It&#8217;s a multimedia e-book broken down into bite sized pieces.</p>\n\n<p>Private Siminars are designed to aid collaboration and/or training.
