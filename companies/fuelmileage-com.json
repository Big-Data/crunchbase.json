Track, Research and Improve your cars fuel mileage with others in an easy to use web application.</p>\n\n<p>We offer 3 ways to add fillups. Website, Mobile site (works on ALL smartphones), and text message. Not everyone has a data package for their phones so we wanted to come up with a way for them to be able to remotely add fillups. Also you receive a text back with the MPG for that trip. So you don&#8217;t have to wait until youâ€™re around a computer to see your MPG for that trip. We also have a full mobile site. Basically anything you can do on our main site you can do from your mobile phone. We just released our android app last month to make it easy for Google phone users. Just search the app market for &#8220;fuel mileage&#8221;, our app is &#8220;The Fuel Mileage Tracker&#8221;. We are just about ready to launch our BlackBerry app as well.</p>\n\n<p>Also when adding your vehicles you have the opportunity to add a list of modifications. So others can see if your vehicle is completely stock opposed to one that isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to searching for other vehicles, I like to think our method/options are more in line with how the user would want to search. We have 2 options. First you can drill down on Make, model then vehicle. Our 2nd method allows you to search for a keyword. So rather than have to search through a page with tons of makes and manufactures you can simple to a &#8220;keyword&#8221; search and it will return every make/model/vehicle in the database that matches the keyword as your typing, which seems to save time.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to reporting, we have segmented into 2 types. One being &#8220;My Reports&#8221; which is specific to your username. Detailed analytics including graphing based on your vehicle(s). One report in general that is very useful is the &#8220;Monthly Cost Breakdown&#8221; report that details total fillups, distance, average mpg, total cost and cost/mile for each month you have been tracking. Second being &#8220;Reports&#8221; which contain detailed analytics for any vehicle in the system. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0007/7232/77232v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0007/7232/77232v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[288,40],"assets/images/resized/0007/7232/77232v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/Owner","person":{"first_name":"Shawn","last_name":"Fultz","permalink":"shawn-fultz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"FutureHosting.com","permalink":"futurehosting-com","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Office","address1":"121 Peggy Green Lane","address2":"","zip_code":"43147","city":"Pickerington","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"West Coast Sales","address1":"192 E Daisyfield Dr.","address2":"","zip_code":"84020","city":"Draper","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
