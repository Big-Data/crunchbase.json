People can order online or over the phone. The company has a customer service team operating 24/7, and there&#8217;s always someone watching every online order that goes through to make sure people get exactly what they ordered.   </p>\n\n<p>On GrubHub.com or its iPhone or Android apps, people can browse and compare menus options and prices, view delivery hours, read reviews placed by other GrubHub users, and take advantage of coupons. People can also store favorite menus, record past orders, write reviews, and leave notes for delivery drivers on how to access their building. </p>\n\n<p>GrubHub.com was founded in 2004 by Chicago-based software engineers Matt Maloney and Mike Evans. The venture-backed company has grown rapidly, and works with more than 17,000 restaurants for online ordering and is available in more than 400 cities across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Co-founders Maloney and Evans got the idea while working on Apartments.com - a search engine for apartments. They often ordered food for delivery but got tired of the same-old; they thought there should to be an online service listing of various restaurants that delivered but were shocked to find none.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/9729/19729v12-max-150x150.png"],[[133,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/9729/19729v12-max-250x250.png"],[[133,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/9729/19729v12-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"GrubHub","permalink":"grubhub","image":null},{"name":"OrderHub","permalink":"orderhub","image":null},{"name":"DeliveryHub","permalink":"deliveryhub","image":null},{"name":"Track
