These research projects aimed towards Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) with a focus upon combining electronics and paper products. Deep investigations were performed upon development and characterization of high frequency RFID antennas printed on paper with electrically conductive ink.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the technology of printed electronics one step further the concept Action Activated Tags (AAT) was developed. AAT was a unique concept that introduced RFID tags incorporating printed sensors and at the same time combining the benefits of passive and active tags. The industrial interest of this concept required full commercialization and Sensible Solutions Sweden AB was born.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/6380/86380v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0008/6380/86380v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[344,151],"assets/images/resized/0008/6380/86380v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$427k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sensiblesolutions.se/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=37","source_description":"VC boosting science to sale","raised_amount":427000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"VÃ¤sternorrlandsfonden","permalink":"vsternorrlandsfonden","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Investa FÃ¶retagskapital","permalink":"investa-fretagskapital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/2341/102341v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[165,57],"assets/images/resized/0010/2341/102341v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[165,57],"assets/images/resized/0010/2341/102341v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SamInvest Mitt","permalink":"saminvest-mitt","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ1","address1":"Storgatan 90","address2":"Ã…kroken Science Park","zip_code":"S-851 70","city":"Sundsvall","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0008/6381/86381v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,235],"assets/images/resized/0008/6381/86381v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,424],"assets/images/resized/0008/6381/86381v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
