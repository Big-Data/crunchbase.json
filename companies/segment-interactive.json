While the most of the industry stops with estimating WHAT visitors might be interested in, our core classification engines track visitor&#8217;s intent and also reliably predict WHEN and HOW the media of interest should be presented to ensure its consumption. </p>\n\n<p>By combining advanced cognitive modeling and state-of-the-art computational methods we have gone deep into understanding, modeling and analyzing online behavior. Our data-driven framework feeds off custom audience research that enables trustworthy linking of behavior with psycho-graphics and demographics. </p>\n\n<p>Segment Interactive offers several revenue maximizing analytics, real-time targeting, and optimization solutions for ad agencies, ad networks, and publishers. Our relevant and powerful insights also enable publishers and advertisers to refine their audience monetization strategy and to increase the impact of their visitor research.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0017/2283/172283v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0017/2283/172283v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,163],"assets/images/resized/0017/2283/172283v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
