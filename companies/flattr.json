Users are able to pay a small amount every month (minimum 2 euros) and then click Flattr buttons on sites to share the money they paid among those sites, comparable to an Like button with money on top.</p>\n\n<p>The word &#8220;flattr&#8221; is used as a verb, to indicate payments through the Flattr system - so when a user clicks a Flattr button and they are logged in to the Flattr site, they are said to be &#8220;flattring&#8221; the page they are on. Sunde said, &#8220;We want to encourage people to share money as well as
