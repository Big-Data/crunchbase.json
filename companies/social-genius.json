This tool also allows friends to share music preferences by bumping phones which results in a new playlist based on their common taste.  Another feature, DJ, allows everyone in the room to bump with one device and crowd-source the next playlist.   Many of these activities add to the user&#8217;s point history.  The more active users not only listen for free for a longer period, but also have the opportunity to become tastemakers, collect badges and start or influence group sessions.  </p>\n\n<p>The AudioVroom service is supported by the Echo Nest as well as 7Digital.</p>\n\n<p>The team recently introduced (at San Francisco Music Hack Day) an HTML5 version of AudioVroom, the DJ version that works with any computer, as well as a Lollapalooza concert profile as one example of how AudioVroom can be used as a marketing tool by artists and event organizers. </p>\n\n<p>Each of the three core team members has over 14 years of experience in his/her field, and brings expertise in consumer technology development, wireless networking, information security, music analytics, business development and operations. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0020/6629/206629v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,238],"assets/images/resized/0020/6629/206629v2-max-250x250.png"],[[399,380],"assets/images/resized/0020/6629/206629v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Sanem","last_name":"Alkan","permalink":"sanem-alkan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientist","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"T.
