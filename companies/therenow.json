Teachers need more support in the classroom and that means having a second pair of eyes to assist in learning complex teaching and classroom management strategies.</p>\n\n<p>thereNow&#8217;s flagship product, IRIS Connectâ„¢, is the technology platform that opens a virtual window into a teachers classroom. IRIS Connectâ„¢ is a classroom observation and performance feedback system comprised of (1) a portable camera device and (2) web-based software. IRIS Connectâ„¢ allows observers (e.g., expert coaches, peer teachers, researchers, student-teacher advisors, etc.) to observe and give individualized feedback to teachers in their classrooms without visiting the classroom in person.  IRIS Connectâ„¢ also allows experienced teachers to record themselves, document, and explicate good teaching that can be shared with other IRIS Connectâ„¢ users.</p>\n\n<p>IRIS Connectâ„¢ makes the critical components of follow up and in-class PD feasible, scalable, and affordable. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0008/3887/83887v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0008/3887/83887v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0008/3887/83887v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Casey","last_name":"Elliott","permalink":"casey-elliott","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Shawn","last_name":"Edmondson, Ph.D.","permalink":"shawn-edmondson-ph-d","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.35M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"Federal Appropiation ","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2004,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Department of Education","permalink":"department-of-education","image":null},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"SBIR - Institute for Education Sciences","raised_amount":850000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"U.S. Department of Education","permalink":"u-s-department-of-education","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0010/3955/103955v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0010/3955/103955v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/3955/103955v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1750 N.
