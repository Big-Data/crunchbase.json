The company&#8217;s focus quickly shifted, and by 2001 it had turned its sights on the B2B segment, gearing up to its current position as a leading developer of solutions for customer interaction and large-scale contact center operations. Currently, the NeoAssist platform is in use by most of the major e-commerce sites and several companies of various sectors in Brazil and Latin America.</p>\n\n<p>Using proprietary technology dubbed &#8220;Neoask&#8221;, the platform allows users to obtain 70% to 95% self-help indices without any end-user learning curve.  The responses to the users questions are presented online, instantly, 24hrs a day, 7 days a week without human manual interaction.  This Intelligent Service module allows your contact center to focus its time and energy on complex cases which require more detailed follow through.  In these cases, the integrated platform also excels with mature top-of-market multi-platform tools for multi-media servicing of customers, be it through E-Mail, the Web (including real-time chat and form-based interactions), Social Networks, the Phone, or any other contact method the company wishes to open for communication.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010 the platform served over 7 million customer interactions . In 2011 this number surpassed the 30 million mark, as NeoAssist.com was deployed in more than 120 new operations.  Expectations are high for 2012 as all initial goals have been met or surpassed.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0021/1723/211723v2-max-150x150.png"],[[206,26],"assets/images/resized/0021/1723/211723v2-max-250x250.png"],[[206,26],"assets/images/resized/0021/1723/211723v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Roy","last_name":"Nasser","permalink":"roy-nasser","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"Deweik","permalink":"albert-deweik","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Av.
