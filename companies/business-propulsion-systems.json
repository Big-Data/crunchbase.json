Some companies undertake such activities voluntarily, considering them management best practice. Other companies participate because they are mandated by external regulations. Whatever the reason, BPS Resolver has a suite of software products designed to make corporate governance, risk management and compliance easy.</p>\n\n<p>Their software helps organizations to identify, document and assess risks and related business objectives, business processes, internal controls and policies. It provides a workflow-driven ability to keep this information up to date, test the quality of the control environment, remediate deficiencies, conduct audits and stay abreast of changes to the regulatory environment.</p>\n\n<p>BPS Resolver makes it simple for companies to effectively mobilize people to address risk proactively and to demonstrate and document these efforts internally and to third parties. Our products have supported over 500 companies in 100 countries to meet oversight and assurance goals.</p>\n\n<p>BPS Resolver is head-quartered in Toronto, Canada and has been providing risk solutions globally for over ten years.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0008/4529/84529v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/4529/84529v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0008/4529/84529v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Taylor","permalink":"steve-taylor-4","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"james-patterson-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product - GRC Cloud","person":{"first_name":"Malissa","last_name":"Lundgren","permalink":"malissa-lundgren","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Wertman","permalink":"mike-wertman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product - Ballot and Survey","person":{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"Crampton","permalink":"joe-crampton","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President , Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Opausky","permalink":"mark-opausky","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/2440/152440v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0015/2440/152440v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0015/2440/152440v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Wilson","permalink":"steve-wilson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$8.24M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":4430000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":4,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Covington Associates","permalink":"covington-associates","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/3484/23484v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3484/23484v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,74],"assets/images/resized/0002/3484/23484v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Brookfield Asset Management","permalink":"brookfield-asset-management","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0010/0554/100554v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0010/0554/100554v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[401,38],"assets/images/resized/0010/0554/100554v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":3810000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Covington Capital","permalink":"covington-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0010/1186/101186v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0010/1186/101186v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[356,58],"assets/images/resized/0010/1186/101186v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Brascan Asset Management","permalink":"brascan-asset-management","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Klister Credit","permalink":"klister-credit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0010/5788/105788v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/5788/105788v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/5788/105788v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"703 Evans Avenue","address2":"Suite 107","zip_code":"M9C 5E9","city":"Toronto, ON","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0008/4528/84528v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,148],"assets/images/resized/0008/4528/84528v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,267],"assets/images/resized/0008/4528/84528v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
