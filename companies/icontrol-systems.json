Rather than foolishly pretending errors simply do not exist, the iControl system is designed to capture and analyze data from retailers and vendors.  The system measures and evaluates terabytes of data encompassing every sale of every product at every store.  The objective is to spot and rectify errors â€“ on either side â€“ in order to drive scanning accuracy as close as possible to 100%.  It is only through this level of commitment that SBT can succeed long-term.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0011/0249/110249v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0011/0249/110249v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,166],"assets/images/resized/0011/0249/110249v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tal","last_name":"J Zlotnitsky","permalink":"tal-j-zlotnitsky","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Marketing Officer","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"D'Aloia","permalink":"john-daloia","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP/Sales & Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Maly","permalink":"elizabeth-maly","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP/Operations","person":{"first_name":"J.","last_name":"Michael Hughes","permalink":"j-michael-hughes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Harris","permalink":"bill-harris","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/4884/154884v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[122,179],"assets/images/resized/0015/4884/154884v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[122,179],"assets/images/resized/0015/4884/154884v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Stonecipher","permalink":"harry-stonecipher","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Zlotnitsky","permalink":"sean-zlotnitsky","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Abrahams","permalink":"gary-abrahams","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"www.parkcitygroup.com","permalink":"www-parkcitygroup-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Law firm","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Walters, Levine","permalink":"walters-levine","image":null}},{"title":"Law firm","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"Sidley Austin","permalink":"sidley-austin","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"11900 Parklawn Dr","address2":"Suites 200-205","zip_code":"20852","city":"Rockville","state_code":"MD","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0010/9885/109885v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,179],"assets/images/resized/0010/9885/109885v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,322],"assets/images/resized/0010/9885/109885v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
