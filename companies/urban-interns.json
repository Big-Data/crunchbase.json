Itâ€™s a faster and easier way for an entrepreneurial organization to grow their team leveraging top talent looking for a range of opportunities. </p>\n\n<p>Urban Interns was created to become a go-to resource to meet the hiring needs of growing companies.Â  Many entrepreneurial organizations build their staff leveraging a range of variable resources including part-time help, freelancers and interns. Â The economics of using a recruiting firm or paying hundreds of dollars on a big job board geared to long term professional development donâ€™t make sense.Â  Filling positions by navigating through university career resources can be an unnecessarily time intensive process. Urban InternsÂ provides a cost effective solution to the business owner looking to find a quality candidate database at their fingertips. For job-seekers, as â€œsmall businessâ€ is expected to continue to grow as a powerful engine for job creation, you see more and more talented people turning to these same positions to get a foot in the door with otherwise undiscoverable entrepreneurial organizations.  </p>\n\n<p>Urban Interns operates in multiple cities in the US including NYC, Boston, Chicago and Washington DC, and 1/3 of the positions on the site are virtual. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0007/8700/78700v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/8700/78700v2-max-250x250.png"],[[272,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/8700/78700v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Cari","last_name":"Sommer","permalink":"cari-sommer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"Porat","permalink":"lauren-porat","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$250k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/30/urban-interns/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":30,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"NY Office","address1":"708 Third Ave","address2":"6th Floor","zip_code":"10017","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0012/6410/126410v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0012/6410/126410v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0012/6410/126410v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
