Free Range Content, Inc. serves everyone in the online publishing industry, from commercial publishers whose product is quality original content to social publishers who curate and share content with their niche audiences and community.</p>\n\n<p>Repost.Us is a frictionless instant syndication platform through which content can be instantly syndicated to another publisher, blogger, or website with a few clicks and no prior business relationshipâ€”24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Repost.Us manages the entire content syndication process â€“ from formatting content for the syndication site to delivering advertising to direct payments and tracking impressions. Syndicators receive an embed code that enables them to post the content on their own site quickly and easilyâ€”just like a video. Repost.Us loads content directly from the origination site into the readerâ€™s browser, which guarantees content integrity and ensures that the original publisher remains the primary search destination.</p>\n\n<p>Curate.Us is a tool that gives users a simple, great-looking way to share content, instantly boosting the impact of blog posts, e-mail, websites, forums, and social sharing. With one click, Curate.Us creates screenshot-like visual clips and automatically formatted quotes that link directly back to the source. Viewers are five times more likely to click through to the original publisher from Curate.Us clips and quotes than through traditional links.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0007/9410/79410v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0007/9410/79410v6-max-250x250.png"],[[281,97],"assets/images/resized/0007/9410/79410v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Pettitt","permalink":"john-pettitt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"McElreavy","permalink":"tim-mcelreavy","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Kate","last_name":"McKinley","permalink":"kate-mckinley","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Free Range Content HQ","address1":"506 Baker Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94117","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launched Private Beta","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"http://clp.ly/1137J","source_text":null,"source_description":"clp.ly is Content in Context","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Free Range Content","permalink":"free-range-events"}},{"description":"Free Range Content, Inc. rebrands its flagship service clp.ly as Curate.Us.
