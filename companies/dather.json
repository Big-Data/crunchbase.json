The event sponsor, Samsung, does not participate and once the event ends they lose contact with the attendees.  Also, the attendees donâ€™t have a unified place to share their experience.</p>\n\n<p>Thatâ€™s where Dather comes in.  Our service provides value by increasing the level of engagement for attendees as well as non-attendees, and for communication between brand-to-customer and customer-to-customer.  The attendees love it because they now have a multi-media scrapbook of the event.</p>\n\n<p>The sponsorâ€™s return on investment is extended beyond what could be created from the event alone. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0008/8814/88814v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0008/8814/88814v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,86],"assets/images/resized/0008/8814/88814v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Boyd","permalink":"scott-boyd","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Kieve","last_name":"Huffman","permalink":"kieve-huffman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5265/95265v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5265/95265v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[354,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/5265/95265v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_kieve_huffman_dather/s-0028879.html","title":"Socaltech Interview"}]}
