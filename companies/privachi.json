Additionally, on current social networking services,  3&#8217;rd party applications installed by users find sneaky ways to access and &#8220;leak&#8221; user&#8217;s profile. </p>\n\n<p>On Privachi, user&#8217;s data posted on the service is encrypted such that only the user and his friends can decrypt it. Privachi cannot &#8220;listen in&#8221; on the conversation. Additionally, Privachi is designed with the belief  that no one service provider should own all of user&#8217;s data (including Privachi). Privachi provides a mechanism to distribute user&#8217;s data across his other cloud storage accounts. For example, photo posted on Privachi could be stored in the user&#8217;s Picasa account, while the comments on that photo is stored in the user&#8217;s box.net or dropbox account). This results in a distribution of user&#8217;s context across services, thus, preventing any one service from knowing everything about the user.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0012/1969/121969v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0012/1969/121969v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,142],"assets/images/resized/0012/1969/121969v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0013/3465/133465v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0013/3465/133465v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,239],"assets/images/resized/0013/3465/133465v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/5/prweb8378396.htm","title":"Press release"}]}
