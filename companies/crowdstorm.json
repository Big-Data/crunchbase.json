The site is fueled by user-submitted product listings and written product reviews, but it also has featured expert reviews, buyer guides, and Q&amp;A sessions. Crowdstorm has recently integrated third-party price search engines including Amazon, Shopping.com and eBay. They have also started using an algorithm that ranks users reviews and helps find the most relevant and useful reviews for each user. The algorithm is heavily influenced by similarities between users and social network relationships. </p>\n\n<p>The site promotes an open policy by allowing users to take their reviews and post them to blogs, other reviews sites and online stores. This will help to break review content from being exclusive to only ecommerce and review sites. </p>\n\n<p>Competitors include <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaboodle\" title=\"Kaboodle\">Kaboodle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaboodle\" title=\"TheFind.com\">TheFind.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaboodle\" title=\"Wishpot\">Wishpot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaboodle\" title=\"VibeAgent\">VibeAgent</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0000/0010/10v1-max-150x150.png"],[[247,64],"assets/images/resized/0000/0010/10v1-max-250x250.png"],[[247,64],"assets/images/resized/0000/0010/10v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Crowdstorm","permalink":"crowdstorm","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Wilkinson","permalink":"philip-wilkinson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/3644/33644v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0003/3644/33644v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,361],"assets/images/resized/0003/3644/33644v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Philip Wilkinson</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Twenga","permalink":"twenga","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/2551/2551v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/2551/2551v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,132],"assets/images/resized/0000/2551/2551v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kaboodle","permalink":"kaboodle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/6674/16674v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/6674/16674v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/6674/16674v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"SmartRatings","permalink":"smartratings","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/5164/15164v1-max-150x150.png"],[[189,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/5164/15164v1-max-250x250.png"],[[189,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/5164/15164v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"iliketotallyloveit","permalink":"iliketotallyloveit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/6099/16099v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[170,105],"assets/images/resized/0001/6099/16099v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[170,105],"assets/images/resized/0001/6099/16099v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.500152,"longitude":-0.126236}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
