DCIM solutions are a new class of tools (Gartner coined the term in January) for intelligent data center capacity planning. They graphically display a complete inventory of the data centerâ€™s physical and logical assets showing rack and data center floor location and rack heat load.  Combined with advance modeling capabilities the tools allow data center managers to optimally place data center assets to make the most efficient use of power, cooling and space, enabling a reduction in operating expenses by as much as 20% annually (Per Gartner).</p>\n\n<p>Other reports show that using the tools can result in a 50% reduction in the time to deploy new assets, extending data center life by up to 75%, and helping attain a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) rating of 2.0 or less.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0011/1092/111092v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0011/1092/111092v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,87],"assets/images/resized/0011/1092/111092v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Doug","last_name":"Sabella","permalink":"doug-sabella","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Owen","last_name":"Nisbett","permalink":"owen-nisbett","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Temple","permalink":"jon-temple","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Rackwise","permalink":"rackwise","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0018/7647/187647v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/7647/187647v1-max-250x250.png"],[[430,69],"assets/images/resized/0018/7647/187647v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Raritan","permalink":"raritan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/7396/97396v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/7396/97396v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/7396/97396v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"iTRACS CDC","permalink":"itracs-cdc","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Johnson King ","permalink":"johnson-king","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0011/1201/111201v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0011/1201/111201v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,52],"assets/images/resized/0011/1201/111201v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$12M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/21/nlyte-series-c-12-million/","source_description":"Nlyte Closes $12 Million To Help Data Centers Last Longer, Use Less Energy","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"NGEN Partners","permalink":"ngen-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/9406/29406v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/9406/29406v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[201,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/9406/29406v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Balderton Capital","permalink":"balderton-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/3274/13274v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0001/3274/13274v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,301],"assets/images/resized/0001/3274/13274v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Ruffer","permalink":"ruffer","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"4040 Campbell Rd.
