Our customers save money through reduced power consumption and CO2 emissions. They also benefit from increased uptime, through our focus on disaster prevention and, if need be, substantially faster recovery. Racktivity&#8217;s Rack Controller replaces dumb power distribution units with a smart device that tracks energy use, temperature, humidity, airflow and rack security. It helps IT managers prevent and diagnose problems at the power and environmental layer.</p>\n\n<p>Racktivity&#8217;s RackController device, including PCBs, schematics, firmware, case and software, was designed in-house in the company&#8217;s research labs in Ghent.</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded in 2008 by Wilbert Ingels, CTO, who held senior management roles at Level 3 and Terremark. Serial entrepreneur Kristof De Spiegeleer seeded the company and is its CEO. De Spiegeleer and the Racktivity team have a proven track record in developing and bringing innovative technologies to commercial successes, including Datacenter Technologies (acquired by Symantec), Hostbasket (acquired by Telenet), Dedigate (acquired by Terremark) and Q-Layer (acquired by SUN Microsystems). The Belgian company received its first round of venture capital funding in 2009 from Big Bang Ventures.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/4951/74951v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[236,85],"assets/images/resized/0007/4951/74951v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[236,85],"assets/images/resized/0007/4951/74951v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Director","person":{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Maene","permalink":"frank-maene-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$9.75M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.businesscomputingworld.co.uk/newswire/topic.php?id=160","source_description":"Racktivity completes 1.2 Million euro funding round","raised_amount":1750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":30,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Big Bang Ventures","permalink":"big-bang-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/2982/22982v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[199,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/2982/22982v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[199,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/2982/22982v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/01/racktivity-series-b-8-million","source_description":"TechCrunch Green Tech","raised_amount":8000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Partech International","permalink":"partech-international","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/2926/2926v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/2926/2926v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,111],"assets/images/resized/0000/2926/2926v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Big Bang Ventures","permalink":"big-bang-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/2982/22982v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[199,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/2982/22982v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[199,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/2982/22982v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Racktivity NV","address1":"Antwerpsesteenweg 19","address2":"","zip_code":"9080","city":"Lochristi","state_code":null,"country_code":"BEL","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"HQ","address1":"2100 Seaport Blvd. ","address2":"Suite 400","zip_code":"94063","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0007/4950/74950v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,215],"assets/images/resized/0007/4950/74950v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,387],"assets/images/resized/0007/4950/74950v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
