We pride ourselves on being different &#8211; from our expert knowledge of placing product in the physical retail environment to working with non-profits and other channel partners to develop product that supports charity &#8211; our goal is to lift up labels, bands, artists and other producers and ensure their success. </p>\n\n<p>Altavoz is grounded by a renewed focus and a two-pronged, multi-platform and global strategy:</p>\n\n<p>On the traditional distribution service side, we take physical and digital product and sell it as a full-service, direct wholesaler â€“ through brick and mortar and online retailers. We collect and analyze geo-enabled data to determine the best placement of music and other product in retail, concert, and tour environments. By Q4 2012, we will add streaming and download service to our platform.</p>\n\n<p>Our niche is developing outstanding entertainment product as P&amp;D deals for nonprofit entities whose profits go to support charitable causes. Our first such deal is with the David Lynch Foundation Music. Once the product is developed we distribute the physical and or digital format of the product.</p>\n\n<p>The privately owned Maryland C. corporation is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0013/4920/134920v4-max-150x150.png"],[[195,117],"assets/images/resized/0013/4920/134920v4-max-250x250.png"],[[195,117],"assets/images/resized/0013/4920/134920v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman & Co-Ceo","person":{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"Jacobsen","permalink":"nelson-jacobsen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/9629/139629v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/9629/139629v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0013/9629/139629v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Ceo","person":{"first_name":"Jessamyn","last_name":"Sarmiento","permalink":"jessamyn-sarmiento","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Raymond","last_name":"Bell","permalink":"raymond-bell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sales","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Gohl","permalink":"alex-gohl","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President,  Label Relations","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Pittman","permalink":"aaron-pittman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Daly","permalink":"bill-daly","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Redeye Distribution","permalink":"redeye-distribution","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Red Distribution","permalink":"red-distribution","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"ADA","permalink":"ada","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Burnside Distribution Corporation","permalink":"burnside-distribution-corporation","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$125k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Family ","raised_amount":125000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"Jacobsen","permalink":"nancy-jacobsen","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Private Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"20016","city":"Washington","state_code":"DC","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Shipping Office","address1":"622 N.
