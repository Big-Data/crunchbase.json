Three simple facts. Since travel is an intensively commerical business, itâ€™s usually hard to find a complete, independent source of information for all modes of transport. CityHook addresses all of these points - we show independent information about all travel options and present them in a great visual format that makes it easy to find the best option for a passenger. The layout makes it easy to pick an option by looking, not reading. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/8017/208017v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/8017/208017v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/8017/208017v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Dublin","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Dublin","state_code":null,"country_code":"IRL","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Milano","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Milan","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launched Mobile App","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"http://www.ucd.ie/innovation/newsevents/newsarchive/2012/september/cityhooklaunchesnewtravelapp/name,133276,en.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Press release","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"CityHook","permalink":"cityhook"}},{"description":"Finalist in SeedCamp Paris","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"http://www.rudebaguette.com/2012/11/30/here-are-the-20-startups-selected-for-seedcamp-paris/","source_text":null,"source_description":"SeedCamp news (rudebaguette.com)","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"CityHook","permalink":"cityhook"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rmiBLSL2dLE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>CityHook promotion video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0020/8016/208016v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0020/8016/208016v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,264],"assets/images/resized/0020/8016/208016v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
