Thousands of attorneys, paralegals and other professionals have to â€˜stamp batesâ€™ manually every single day and they donâ€™t have any choice. Itâ€™s the standard for the legal profession in the US, and many courts simply wonâ€™t accept any documents that donâ€™t have proper Bates numbers. Bates Express is a new startup that automatically applies Bates numbers to e-mails, images, HTML, Word and PDF documents, saving people time and money. The company allows clients to try the software free, before making the buying decision, and keeps the cost of licenses as low as $20 per seat.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
