Rather than continue to let entrepreneurs and investors waste millions of dollars on failed technology efforts, we focused on being a partner, sharing in your risk, and success. </p>\n\n<p>We focused on what a relationship would look like if there was a team that could remove barriers for start-ups, advise them in key business areas such as strategic planning, sales and marketing, HR and Finance, and IT, and create alignment with their objectives and exit strategies. We then built a unique business model around that which means: We only succeed when your company succeeds! </p>\n\n<p>Experienced Web Development and Start-up Advisory Team: </p>\n\n<p>Our team has decades of software development experience in key areas of project management, systems administration, database, middle-tier architecture, and design. We have entrepreneurs, nerds, a suit, a designer, and a project manager. The key to being successful with our clients is a combination of our proven process, our ability to be pragmatic, and a track record of doing the impossible, on-time and on-budget! </p>\n\n<p>See what others are saying: www.qstartlabs.com/results </p>\n\n<p>Learn about QStart Labs for Investors:http://www.qstartlabs.com/for/VC.html </p>\n\n<p>Learn about QStart Labs for Start-ups:http://www.qstartlabs.com/for/StartUps.html</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[147,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/5541/65541v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[245,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/5541/65541v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[442,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/5541/65541v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Lamb","permalink":"jeff-lamb","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operations","person":{"first_name":"Kipp","last_name":"Abbot","permalink":"kipp-abbot","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Hiser","permalink":"kevin-hiser","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"One Marconi Place","address2":"274 Marconi Blvd. Ste. 400","zip_code":"43215","city":"Columbus","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
