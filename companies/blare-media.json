We offer high quality, attention-getting results that are designed to meet and achieve the specific goals and/or target markets of each individual client.</p>\n\n<p>The partners launched their firm with one question in mind: How can we deliver cinema- and broadcast-quality video productions affordably while still making a living? Solving this required extensive research and investment in the latest digital cameras and software which allow for excellent quality while cutting expenses and waste with a streamlined workflow. This makes the operation “lean and mean”—extremely flexible while able to produce a high volume of quality video content in a short period of time.</p>\n\n<p>One of BLARE Media’s aims is to take a commercial for a local company and produce it to look like a blockbuster or Super Bowl ad, hence its slogan to “think national” in its productions instead of making typical “come on down”-type spots. To sum up the BLARE Media philosophy in one sentence: “Stellar, Hollywood-quality video production at an affordable price everyone can work with.”</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0020/1802/201802v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,175],"assets/images/resized/0020/1802/201802v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,316],"assets/images/resized/0020/1802/201802v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","person":{"first_name":"Blake","last_name":"Barnett","permalink":"blake-barnett-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"BLARE Media Headquarters","address1":"7676 N.
