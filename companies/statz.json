But what about your data?</p>\n\n<p>Letâ€™s be clear â€“ itâ€™s not your identity weâ€™re talking about, itâ€™s your data: How much energy you use, when you make calls, how you use products. Data about your behavior as a consumer that you already see in statements and bills. YOUR data. Consumer data that is  incredibly valuable, fueling a $75 billion industry.</p>\n\n<p>At Statz we believe you should own and benefit from your data. We strip out or mask your identity. You decide how much data is visible or sold. And once we open our Marketplace to buyers, you â€“ not some big company - will get paid when your data is sold.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s time to open a Statz account. Take control of your personal data.
