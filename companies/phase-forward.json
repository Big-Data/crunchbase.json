Phase Forward&#8217;s technology and global services are designed to enable life sciences companies to automate and integrate the management of their entire clinical development process â€“ from study initiation and FDA submission through post-marketing studies. </p>\n\n<p>Until its acquisition by <a href=\"/company/oracle\" title=\"Oracle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oracle</a> in April 2010, Phase Forward was a publicly held company. Its corporate headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, international headquarters in Maidenhead, UK, and its regional offices in the U.S., Japan, France and Australia.</p>\n\n<p>Phase Forward was founded in 1997 by Paul Bleicher, M.D, Ph.D., who had experienced firsthand the complexities involved in developing and conducting paper-based trials â€“ in particular, capturing, managing, and growing volumes of data. Dr. Bleicherâ€™s vision was to develop technology that would enable organizations to make the shift from paper-based methods to Internet-enabled solutions. His pioneering efforts have contributed significantly to Phase Forwardâ€™s evolution from initial concept to its current industry-leading position.</p>\n\n<p>Spearheading the evolution of electronic data capture (EDC) with its industry-leading InFormâ„¢ solution, Phase Forward has transformed the way clinical data are collected, analyzed and managed. With the acquisition of Lincoln Technologiesâ€™ innovative safety management solutions, Phase Forward took steps to provide the end-to-end solutions customers need to track and monitor product efficacy and safety, while building their trials more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-250x250.png"],[[260,24],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technologist, IRT Products Group","person":{"first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"Talapan","permalink":"adrian-talapan-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2322/152322v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[243,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/2322/152322v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[438,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/2322/152322v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO, CAO, Treasurer","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Menard","permalink":"christopher-menard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/6055/106055v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,163],"assets/images/resized/0010/6055/106055v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,163],"assets/images/resized/0010/6055/106055v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President, Finance","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Menard","permalink":"christopher-menard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/6055/106055v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,163],"assets/images/resized/0010/6055/106055v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,163],"assets/images/resized/0010/6055/106055v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP Legal and Regulatory Services","person":{"first_name":"Ari","last_name":"Buchler","permalink":"ari-buchler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4586/134586v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/4586/134586v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[219,263],"assets/images/resized/0013/4586/134586v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":685000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/16/oracle-buys-healthcare-software-firm-phase-forward-for-685-million/#ixzz0lhEbXNzs","source_description":"Oracle Buys Healthcare Software Firm Phase Forward For $685 Million ","acquired_year":2010,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":20,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Oracle Corporation","permalink":"oracle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-150x150.png"],[[158,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-250x250.png"],[[158,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":14000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://investor.phaseforward.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=177364&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1279275&highlight=","source_description":"Phase Forward Acquires Waban Software","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":22,"company":{"name":"Waban Software","permalink":"waban-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0005/0986/50986v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/0986/50986v1-max-250x250.png"],[[326,81],"assets/images/resized/0005/0986/50986v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"price_amount":11000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/187436/phase-forward-acquires-maaguzi-llc-innovative-provider-web-based-electronic-patient-repo","source_description":"Phase Forward Acquires Maaguzi LLC, Innovative Provider of Web-Based Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) and Late Phase Solutions","acquired_year":2009,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":27,"company":{"name":"Maaguzi","permalink":"maaguzi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,92],"assets/images/resized/0005/4439/54439v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,92],"assets/images/resized/0005/4439/54439v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,92],"assets/images/resized/0005/4439/54439v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"offices":[{"description":"Phase Forward Inc.","address1":"77 Fourth Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"02451","city":"Waltham","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.392966,"longitude":-71.259334}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0005/0982/50982v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0005/0982/50982v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,305],"assets/images/resized/0005/0982/50982v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
