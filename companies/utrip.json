We know that the planning process of a trip is about as much fun as visiting your Great Aunt Esther (our cheeks still hurt too). We created Utrip because we realized it would have been way more fun to spend that time actually having adventures instead of planning them.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that people travel to truly experience the places they go to. Bringing together awesome ideas and plans is central to allowing the magic of travel to come to life. Rather than spending hours researching and planning your next trip, relax! And let our team do our thing. We hope that Utrip will inspire you to get off your butt and get onto a plane that is headed somewhere incredible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6898/216898v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/6898/216898v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/6898/216898v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Gilad","last_name":"Berenstein","permalink":"gilad-berenstein","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Edan","last_name":"Shahar","permalink":"edan-shahr","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Court","last_name":"Lorenzini","permalink":"court-lorenzini","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Adviser","person":{"first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"Sigel","permalink":"jonah-sigel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0002/1858/21858v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[216,166],"assets/images/resized/0002/1858/21858v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[216,166],"assets/images/resized/0002/1858/21858v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://main.planeteye.com/?page_id=34\" title=\"PlanetEye\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlanetEye</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Relationship Director","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Castle","permalink":"john-castle","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launch of Soft Beta!","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":28,"source_url":"http://utrip.com","source_text":null,"source_description":"Soft Launch","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Utrip","permalink":"utrip"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"640\" height=\"360\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://www.facebook.com/v/376882015714367\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.facebook.com/v/376882015714367\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Utrip</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/2107/192107v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/2107/192107v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/2107/192107v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0019/2108/192108v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,129],"assets/images/resized/0019/2108/192108v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,232],"assets/images/resized/0019/2108/192108v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0021/6896/216896v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,122],"assets/images/resized/0021/6896/216896v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,220],"assets/images/resized/0021/6896/216896v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
