With reimbursements at an all time low, physicians are seeing decreasing collections, so they are now looking for more effective ways to capitalize on the self-pay or cash pay market.</p>\n\n<p>This cash pay market trend is a result of the over 50 million Americans that are uninsured, shopping for affordable health care options.  Even patients that are insured end up paying thousands of dollars a year out-of-pocket, so Save On Medical allows them to view the average price for services in their area, allowing them to contact the medical facility that fits their needs and is in their price range.</p>\n\n<p>The website allows patients to schedule appointments online and even receive further discounts if they pay online upfront, which cuts out the hassle of dealing with billing and collection companies, for both patients and providers. It&#8217;s a win-win.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/8647/168647v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/8647/168647v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0016/8647/168647v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Creator","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Christenberry","permalink":"chris-christenberry","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0016/8646/168646v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,164],"assets/images/resized/0016/8646/168646v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,296],"assets/images/resized/0016/8646/168646v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blog.myatlantichealthsolutions.com/Atlantic-Health-Solutions/bid/106119/The-Self-Pay-Solution-Benefitting-Providers-Patients","title":"Save On Medical: Self Pay Solution"}]}
