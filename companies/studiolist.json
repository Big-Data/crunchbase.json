Studios are filtered for quality of work and organized by location and budget.</p>\n\n<p>The site was launched by Warb Web in February of 2011.  Before the official launch in February, the StudioList founders spent four months creating a shortlist of studios they wanted listed in the directory.  The selection process was based on the aesthetics of the developers published apps, app reviews &amp; ratings, and the quality of the studio&#8217;s website. The company is currently working with these shortlisted developers to get their listings up and running.  </p>\n\n<p>All developer accounts are currently free.  Once studios start receiving a steady flow of leads, the directory will give the studio the option to upgrade to a premium account, or keep their listing free.  Premium accounts will be placed above free listings.  </p>\n\n<p>StudioList hopes to go live with their premium listings at the end of March, 2011.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0012/3843/123843v2-max-150x150.png"],[[195,33],"assets/images/resized/0012/3843/123843v2-max-250x250.png"],[[195,33],"assets/images/resized/0012/3843/123843v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"Squires","permalink":"isaac-squires","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Carly","last_name":"Gloge","permalink":"carly-gloge","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"TheyMakeApps","permalink":"theymakeapps","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/1025/81025v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/1025/81025v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/1025/81025v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MobileDevHQ","permalink":"mobiledevhq","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"791 Poppy Dr","address2":"","zip_code":"80601","city":"Brighton","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0012/3522/123522v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0012/3522/123522v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,335],"assets/images/resized/0012/3522/123522v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.free-press-release.com/news-have-a-million-dollar-app-idea-get-unbiased-advice-for-free-1298412199.html","title":"Have a Million Dollar App Idea?
