You can get your mum and dad for the first bit, and you can use a VC once you&#8217;ve proven your business model.   But your mum and dad have a limited amount they can invest, and a VC will want to take a big stake and invest a significant amount (hundreds of thousands of pounds at the very least).  Even if a VC would consider you,  you may not want that dilution as you&#8217;re not yet able to justify a high valuation, and you may not want the hassle of a major active shareholder, at this stage in your business life.</p>\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re offering investments of up to Â£250,000, in some cases we can help with sales and new staff.   We&#8217;re not quite no strings attached, but we&#8217;d rather that running the business stays your problem &amp; doesn&#8217;t become ours.   We have no formal investment process, and are therefore able to be flexible, decisive and quick.  We don&#8217;t have to invest, we&#8217;re only getting involved because we find your business attractive.   We don&#8217;t charge any fees to anyone: we only make money if you do.</p>\n\n<p>As individuals, we offer a unique combination of entrepreneurial, corporate and investment skills to help the companies we invest in.</p>\n\n<p>For some businesses, which are able to generate profits and have no need for major investment to expand post profitability, we may be the final funding step.  More likely, we&#8217;re a step on the path to a VC, and for that we&#8217;re well connected with VCs and other providers of institutional financing (including government) for future financing rounds.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Anton","last_name":"Wellenreiter","permalink":"anton-wellenreiter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Jones","permalink":"thomas-jones-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Bo","last_name":"Pedersen","permalink":"bo-pedersen","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
