Engines are hooked up to central query servers, receive users&#8217; queries, and send back results. If there are enough engines in the system, then theoretically any possible query can be answered.</p>\n\n<p>Try typing in the name of any standard unix C function (such as recv, recvfrom, or strstr), or any standard php function (such as preg<em>match, str</em>replace, or addslashes) - you get info right on the search results page (like google&#8217;s onebox feature). The C/PHP results come from an engine that specializes in indexing common functions.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested, the About section on the homepage has more info.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[79,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/3023/23023v2-max-150x150.png"],[[79,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/3023/23023v2-max-250x250.png"],[[79,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/3023/23023v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
