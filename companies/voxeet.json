Background noise interrupts, and if two people try and talk at the same time, the sound cuts out. </p>\n\n<p>You’re not sure who’s talking: When you can’t tell if it’s the IT guy or the Marketing VP, the confusing context can make it hard to follow the conversation. </p>\n\n<p>Those days are over. Voxeet replaces the problems with a natural, intuitive technology that makes a conference call feel natural and relaxed. Built by a team of top sound engineers, we call this &#8220;Natural Conferencing&#8221;. </p>\n\n<p>Voxeet is unique and distinct from anything else in the market in 3 ways: </p>\n\n<p>• High Quality: high definition voice quality, so you can focus on the conversation, not the poor connection. </p>\n\n<p>• High Speaker Recognition: 3D sound &amp; visual cues so you always know who’s talking. </p>\n\n<p>• High Mobility: one-click transfers to your cell phone, so you don&#8217;t have to interrupt calls when you need to be on the go.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/9583/219583v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/9583/219583v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[329,329],"assets/images/resized/0021/9583/219583v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yCj-glojqug\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Demo of Voxeet.
