The AVIN makes the job of organizing online wine information easier by uniquely identifying every wine. For example with the AVIN it is possible to know what is being said about any specific wine online.</p>\n\n<p>Adegga has also developed a <a href=\"http://www.adegga.com/blogs\" title=\"search engine for Wine Blogs\" rel=\"nofollow\">search engine for Wine Blogs</a> and is currently indexing 500 wine blogs. This makes it possible to track what is being said about each wine and each wine producer online. Combined with the AVIN bloggers can tag their blog posts and match them with the correct wines on adegga.</p>\n\n<p>Adegga also includes a price comparison engine that gets wines prices directly from wine shops linking directly from a wine page to the buying page on each shop.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/3743/13743v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/3743/13743v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/3743/13743v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Andre","last_name":"Ribeirinho","permalink":"andre-ribeirinho","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Emidio","last_name":"Santos","permalink":"emidio-santos","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Andre","last_name":"Cid Proenca","permalink":"andre-cid-proenca","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"WineLog.net","permalink":"winelog-net","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/1729/1729v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1729/1729v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/1729/1729v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Snooth Media","permalink":"snooth","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/0409/409v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/0409/409v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/0409/409v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"LocalWineEvents","permalink":"localwineevents","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/7197/17197v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0001/7197/17197v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/7197/17197v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Corkd","permalink":"corkd","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/3351/33351v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[90,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/3351/33351v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[90,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/3351/33351v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"CellarTracker!","permalink":"cellartracker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0003/7076/37076v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[245,135],"assets/images/resized/0003/7076/37076v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[245,135],"assets/images/resized/0003/7076/37076v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Vinfolio","permalink":"vinfolio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/6558/26558v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/6558/26558v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/6558/26558v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Lisbon","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":38.707163,"longitude":-9.135517}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://avin.cc","title":"AVIN - An ISBN for Wines"}]}
