These are the most important paragraphs of your organizationâ€™s existence.â€</p>\n\n<p>Big Problem - The Angel Capital Association estimates that only 1 to 4% of start-ups applying for angel investment make it through the entire process to successfully raise capital.  With such a low success rate many entrepreneurs seek high-priced consultants to write their business plan for them.  The problem is the ACEF strongly recommends that the business owner write the business plan when applying for angel investment &#8211; no consultants.  How can a software developer or an engineer with no business plan writing experience possibly compete?</p>\n\n<p>Unique Solution - The ExecutivePlan is the worldâ€™s leading online authority in providing entrepreneurs with assistance in the process of writing business plan executive summaries.  We provide free guides, templates, videos and articles to help entrepreneurs write powerful executive summaries.</p>\n\n<p>The Opportunity - According to the ACEF only 1 in 4 that submit an executive summary to an angel investor will  successfully make it to the next round.  This means that 75% of entrepreneurs seeking angel investment capital need assistance in writing a more powerful, more effective and more memorable executive summary.  Each month Google receives the following number of queries for our relevant keywords:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* How to Write an Executive Summary - 9,900 per month\n* Write Executive Summary - 18,100 per month\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why the ExecutivePlan - As Kawasaki stated, 80% of the entrepreneurs effort should go toward writing an executive summary, and yet startups spend precious cash on business plan consultants.  Now entrepreneurs can write their own business plan, and then simply engage with the ExecutivePlan for content, advice, and consulting services to create an incredible executive summary.  After you get in the door with bankers and investors, your management team, your financials, and your presentation skills will seal the deal. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0010/6484/106484v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0010/6484/106484v2-max-250x250.png"],[[329,88],"assets/images/resized/0010/6484/106484v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Hoeksema","permalink":"adam-hoeksema","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.howtowriteanexecutivesummary.com","title":"Executive Summary Products and Services"}]}
