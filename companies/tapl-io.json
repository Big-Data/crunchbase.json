Essentially, Tapl.io makes a browser work harder so that a user  can find what they&#8217;re looking for faster. There are no settings to set. No preferences to prefer. No buttons to click. No destination sites to remember. No account to create. Nothing. A user can just search the web like they always have, and Tapl.io will provide them with any related pages that it can find.</p>\n\n<p>Once a user finds a place that they want to try, they can share it with friends by clicking the â€œshareâ€ button on the Tapl.io tab bar â€“ at which point they can either send a message or tweet about the place (on Facebook and Twitter respectively). These messages are preloaded with a link, which, when followed, allows the recipient to view the shared place using Tapl.io (if the recipient doesnâ€™t have Tapl.io installed, theyâ€™ll still be able to explore the place using a â€˜testdriveâ€™ version). In effect, Taplio users can share the essence of a place (as opposed to a single serviceâ€™s webpage about a place), and recipients can see everything about a place that made the sharer fall in love with it.</p>\n\n<p>Tapl.io conducts implicit searches based on the content that a user is currently consuming; thereby streamlining a user&#8217;s &#8220;searchflow&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Tapl.io is currently focused on local search and supports these services:</p>\n\n<pre><code>â€¢ Yelp\nâ€¢ Facebook Places\nâ€¢ Google Places\nâ€¢ Google Maps\nâ€¢ MenuPages\nâ€¢ New York Magazine\nâ€¢ Foodspotting\nâ€¢ Foursquare\nâ€¢ Hunch\nâ€¢ OpenTable\nâ€¢ Tripadvisor\nâ€¢ CitySearch\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/8988/138988v2-max-150x150.png"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/8988/138988v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,403],"assets/images/resized/0013/8988/138988v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/24497291?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0013/8987/138987v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0013/8987/138987v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,275],"assets/images/resized/0013/8987/138987v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0014/6020/146020v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0014/6020/146020v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,275],"assets/images/resized/0014/6020/146020v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0014/8838/148838v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0014/8838/148838v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,275],"assets/images/resized/0014/8838/148838v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
