The semantic framework is based on gene, tissue, disease and compound ontologies. This framework contains information from diverse organisms, platforms, data types and research areas is integrated into and correlated within a single searchable environment using proprietary algorithms. It provides a unified interface for researchers to formulate and test new hypotheses across vast collections of experimental data. </p>\n\n<p>The enterprise version of the NextBio platform is being used in life science R&amp;D and drug development by researchers and clinicians at: Merck Pharmaceutical, Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development, L.L.C., Celgene, Genzyme, Eli Lilly and Company, and [[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. This enterprise version allows internal, proprietary data to be uploaded and integrated into the NextBio database of publicly-available data. Scientists are using NextBio to improve their ability to identify relevant prognostic and predictive molecular signatures which are significant in their research.</p>\n\n<p>NextBio was a receiver of the Frost &amp; Sullivan North American Life Sciences Customer Value Enhancement Award in 2008. Since the release it has had more than 1,500,000 visitors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/9141/19141v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/9141/19141v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,111],"assets/images/resized/0001/9141/19141v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Saeid","last_name":"Akhtari","permalink":"saeid-akhtari","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/0759/160759v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/0759/160759v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[321,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/0759/160759v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Saeid Akhtari</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Product Management","person":{"first_name":"Ilya","last_name":"Kupershmidt","permalink":"ilya-kupershmidt","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Satnam","last_name":"Alag","permalink":"satnam-alag","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Mohsen","last_name":"Moazami","permalink":"mohsen-moazami","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/3549/143549v10-max-150x150.png"],[[148,198],"assets/images/resized/0014/3549/143549v10-max-250x250.png"],[[148,198],"assets/images/resized/0014/3549/143549v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Personal Files</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO & VP of Corporate Developmen","person":{"first_name":"Shahram","last_name":"Seyedin-Noor","permalink":"shahram-seyedin-noor","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Grygiel","permalink":"andrew-grygiel","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Merryweather","permalink":"jim-merryweather","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$16.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/06/06/life-science-search-engine-nextbio-raises-7m-led-by-newbury-ventures/","source_description":"Life science search engine NextBio raises $7M, led by Newbury Ventures","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Newbury Ventures","permalink":"newbury-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0002/9265/29265v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/9265/29265v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[254,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/9265/29265v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/06/06/life-science-search-engine-nextbio-raises-7m-led-by-newbury-ventures/","source_description":"Life science search engine NextBio raises $7M, led by Newbury Ventures","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-nextbio-raises-8-million-for-life-sciences-search-engine/","source_description":"NextBio Raises $8 Million For Life Sciences Search Engine","raised_amount":8000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Newbury Ventures","permalink":"newbury-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0002/9265/29265v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/9265/29265v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[254,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/9265/29265v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"475 El Camino Real","address2":"","zip_code":"95050","city":"Santa Clara","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.316653,"longitude":-122.05074}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/8236/48236v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/8236/48236v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0004/8236/48236v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
