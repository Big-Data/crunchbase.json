Traditional QR codes have a fixed action programmed into them, often sending the user to a web site, or video, that isn&#8217;t optimized for their mobile device. The Total QR Code Solution platform, however, automatically creates dynamic QR codes that send the user to a customized mobile content that is optimized for all mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>Liqueo Inc. provides anyone selling anything to anybody the ability to automatically create a template based mobile micro-site for each QR Code. Micro-sites are mini websites optimized for viewing on a mobile device. The micro-site itself is dynamic too, having as many as ten unique actions to choose from. From the micro-site, viewers can link to other websites, download photos and documents, fill out feedback and contest forms, view other micro-site pages, share over social networks, and watch high quality streaming videos.</p>\n\n<p>Users can upload their videos into the Liqueo&#8217;s platform in any format where it is encoded and stored on the Akamai CDN in more than a dozen formats and sizes. When a viewer chooses to watch the video, the platform intelligently streams the correct format and size based on the viewer&#8217;s mobile device. Videos stream flawlessly to ANY web enabled mobile device.</p>\n\n<p>A friend&#8217;s recommendation to buy a product or service is priceless. The Total QR Code Solution platform makes sharing amongst friends and family simple by placing a set of social media icons at the bottom of every micro-site page.</p>\n\n<p>Critical to any marketing effort is the ability to track the effectiveness of a campaign. In addition to Google Analytics integration, The Total QR Code Solution also offers a full suite of custom built in analytics, enabling users to monitor and adjust their campaigns on the fly.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, creating an effective mobile advertising campaign that starts with QR codes can be both challenging and expensive.
