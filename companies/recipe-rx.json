For example, a diabetic client who has tired of eating the same foods will utilize Recipe Rx to find a variety of recipes, prepared food items or even menu items available at local restaurants consistent with their health profile. The user will be further connected to reference material, supplements and health service providers, with the end result that she is fully equipped to make proper food choices and live a healthier life. Customers will have the option to sync existing Google Health or Microsoft Health Vault health profiles with Recipe Rx or access their recommendations via their mobile devices, creating a seamless experience that further empowers healthier decisions. </p>\n\n<p>The core services that Recipe Rx offers lend itself to easy integration of targeted advertising campaigns. Once the user enters their profile information, they are provided with recipes, product suggestions (packaged foods, supplements), and restaurant suggestions. They are also provided with shopping lists where supermarkets or food producers can sponsor results. Similar to a website like Hotels.com which has much of their content built by advertisers, Recipe Rx will receive revenues from directory listings and PPC/CPM campaigns and not be responsible for uploading much of the content from which the user derives value. We believe that the service should be free to the general public, with paid subscriptions available to health care professionals who want the flexibility to customize the portal by which their patient receives recipe suggestions. There are many options for â€œfreemiumâ€ services that the user can upgrade to once they have established trust with our product, but the central short-term focus is on building a solid core product, bringing traffic to critical mass, and monetizing through highly customized pay per click (PPC) and cost per impression (CPM) campaigns in conjunction with their personal recipe and product recommendations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/0079/60079v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,144],"assets/images/resized/0006/0079/60079v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,259],"assets/images/resized/0006/0079/60079v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Camille","last_name":"Macres","permalink":"camille-macres","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Hanson","permalink":"peter-hanson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Programming","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Up & Running Software","permalink":"up-running-software","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"P.O.
