Aerpio was created in a spin-out transaction from Akebia Therapeutics to enable more rapid development of its exciting compounds. It is managed by the same successful team from Akebia, employing a similar outsourced approach to pharmaceutical development.</p>\n\n<p>Aerpio&#8217;s two lead programs include a Tie-2 activator for diabetic macular edema (DME) and vascular leak, and a Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1-α (HIF1-α) stabilizer for wound healing and the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The lead compound for the Tie-2 program, AKB-9778, is currently completing its initial Phase 1 clinical trial, and the HIF1-α stabilization program is progressing toward the clinic with support, in part, from the United States Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health.</p>\n\n<p>The Aerpio team is composed of highly experienced individuals from all facets of pharmaceutical development. During the last 4 years, this team has successfully sharpened their skills at Akebia Therapeutics in the fast paced world of venture backed biopharmaceuticals.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,65],"assets/images/resized/0020/9041/209041v1-max-150x150.png"],[[97,65],"assets/images/resized/0020/9041/209041v1-max-250x250.png"],[[97,65],"assets/images/resized/0020/9041/209041v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"H.
