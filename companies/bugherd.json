It embeds directly into a website so bugs are flagged and managed visually without the need to fill out lengthy forms. BugHerd also lets your client and stakeholders log bugs visually right from within your website or web application. They never have to switch into another app, and it&#8217;s easier and faster than sending an email.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,46],"assets/images/resized/0012/7730/127730v2-max-150x150.png"],[[103,46],"assets/images/resized/0012/7730/127730v2-max-250x250.png"],[[103,46],"assets/images/resized/0012/7730/127730v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Downie","permalink":"alan-downie","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://delimiter.com.au/2012/01/25/bugherd-takes-500k-venture-capital-investment/","source_description":"BugHerd takes $500K venture capital investment","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":25,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Starfish Ventures","permalink":"starfish-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0003/2990/32990v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/2990/32990v1-max-250x250.png"],[[291,85],"assets/images/resized/0003/2990/32990v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/20346231\" width=\"400\" height=\"173\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/20346231\">BugHerd Intro</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user6023319\">BugHerd</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
