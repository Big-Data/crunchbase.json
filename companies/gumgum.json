As a result, the team transformed the advertising industry with the creation of the first in-image ad platform. This groundbreaking model gives publishers a completely new monetization stream and provides brands the opportunity to reach highly targeted mass audiences.</p>\n\n<p>Today, hundreds of the Internet&#8217;s premier websites, including Time Warner Inc., Hearst Corporation, The New York Times Company, and Internet Brands Inc. rely on GumGum to turn photographs into lucrative interactive experiences by overlaying interactive, contextual ad units on top of images. For advertisers, GumGum&#8217;s proprietary image recognition and targeting technology helps garner relevant engagement through highly targeted campaigns that yield 20 times the click-through rate than traditional ad networks.</p>\n\n<p>GumGum is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/2055/12055v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/2055/12055v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/2055/12055v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"In-Image
