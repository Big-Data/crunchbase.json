Every time a customer &#8220;bids,&#8221; the total price of the tickets up for auction increases by one cent. The most recent customer to place a bid will become the &#8220;high bidder,&#8221; and if the timer runs out, he/she will win the auction. There will only be one winner, and the customer will pay whatever the final price is + a small shipping fee.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining customers who did not win the auction will be given a full reimbursement for all bids. This reimbursement will not be a liquid cash deposit, rather a numerical value promotion code reflecting the exact dollar amount of the bids used. The customer may use this code during checkout of HiLo&#8217;s â€œBuy Tickets Nowâ€ avenue.</p>\n\n<p>The second part of HiLo&#8217;s market revolves around â€œBuy Tickets Now.â€ This feature allows the customer to buy tickets immediately, if they would like to avoid the inconvenience of shopping/spending time at an auction. The inventory available for purchase is more than $1 billion worth.</p>\n\n<p>Since all auction tickets are available on HiLo&#8217;s â€œBuy Tickets Nowâ€ market, the customers with a valid used bid credit code can apply their money spent at the â€œAuctionâ€ market for any tickets available in this market. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,63],"assets/images/resized/0013/4681/134681v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[131,63],"assets/images/resized/0013/4681/134681v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[131,63],"assets/images/resized/0013/4681/134681v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Principal","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Perez","permalink":"rob-perez","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Wells","permalink":"ian-wells","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Ticketmaster","permalink":"ticketmaster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/0755/10755v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/0755/10755v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/0755/10755v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"StubHub","permalink":"stubhub","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/3134/13134v1-max-150x150.png"],[[142,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/3134/13134v1-max-250x250.png"],[[142,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/3134/13134v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ScoreBig","permalink":"scorebig","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0007/8677/78677v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,44],"assets/images/resized/0007/8677/78677v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,44],"assets/images/resized/0007/8677/78677v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"TicketsNow","permalink":"ticketsnow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0000/3169/3169v1-max-150x150.png"],[[176,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3169/3169v1-max-250x250.png"],[[176,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3169/3169v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"eBay","permalink":"ebay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$40k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":40000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":19,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HiLo Headquarters","address1":"24 Danbury Rd","address2":"Ste 200","zip_code":"06897","city":"Wilton","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
