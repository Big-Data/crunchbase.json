The company is making video story telling and its unique social editing and collaboration capability accessible to all.  Headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, WeVideo&#8217;s roots are in Norway, where parent organization Inspera has nearly half a decade of experience in the educational video space.  WeVideo was formed to enable individuals and businesses to bring their stories to life through video.  With WeVideo&#8217;s innovative platform and approach, the barriers traditionally associated with video editing, namely cost, editing complexity, heavy computing resource requirements are eliminated.  </p>\n\n<p>WeVideo as a Social Platform</p>\n\n<p>The WeVideo platform is a cloud-based solution with no software to download or install.  All the video editing takes place in a browser on your smartphone, tablet or computer.  Video clips can be uploaded from any device to your own personal media library in the cloud and combined with titles, transitions, effects, animation, music, and narration for professional looking results.  Users have full creative control over the final product compared to other automated solutions.  The WeVideo platform uniquely enables social video creation by providing a collaborative online environment for video content aggregation and/or joint editing of the video story.  All data uploaded to the system is safe from intrusion via highly encrypted password access, allowing you to control who is part of your video editing community.  Finished videos can be shared on the WeVideo platform or published in Internet or HD broadcast quality to your favorite video-sharing site, social networking profile, blog or other destination. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0018/5290/185290v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,55],"assets/images/resized/0018/5290/185290v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,55],"assets/images/resized/0018/5290/185290v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jostein","last_name":"Svendsen","permalink":"jostein-svendsen-4","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Bjorn","last_name":"Rustberggard","permalink":"bjorn-rustberggard-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Development","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Canning","permalink":"john-canning-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business Development","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Hallman","permalink":"john-hallman-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"JayCut","permalink":"jaycut","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0002/5970/25970v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/5970/25970v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,126],"assets/images/resized/0002/5970/25970v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Stroome","permalink":"stroome","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/3609/153609v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/3609/153609v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,367],"assets/images/resized/0015/3609/153609v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Clesh","permalink":"clesh","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"SocialRadius","permalink":"socialradius","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0021/3564/213564v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0021/3564/213564v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,63],"assets/images/resized/0021/3564/213564v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$19.1M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/20/wevideo-raises-19-1m-for-cloud-based-collaborative-video-editing-platform/","source_description":"WeVideo Raises $19.1M For Cloud-Based Collaborative Video Editing Platform","raised_amount":19100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":20,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Crest Capital Ventures","permalink":"crest-capital-ventures","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"444 Ramona Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"https://docs.google.com/a/socialradius.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al6qXmJPcnQ-dExRREZkTDk1NTBHU1FJSE51LVVRblE#gid=1","description":"<p>WeVideo is an online application that allows you to edit your videos online and share the editing process with others.
