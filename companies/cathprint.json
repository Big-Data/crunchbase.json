A long (~1m), thin (~25Î¼m) and narrow (~2mm) double sided board has conductor lines on one side and electrodes on the other. Sensors can also be mounted on the board. This board is rolled into a tube by pulling the stripe through a nozzle and simultaneously filling it with glue. This means that instead of doing all electrical connections manually, CathPrint technology allows it to be made in an automated way.</p>\n\n<p>The enabling breakthrough for the establishment of CathPrint AB is a unique, patent-pending concept - CathPrintâ„¢. This method has two major advantages:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It allows for the miniaturization of catheters with printed conductors. This actualizes the potential of delivering catheters of superior flexibility with minimal invasiveness. This is beneficial for both the practitioners and the patient.</p></li>\n<li><p>It makes it possible to mass produce these catheters efficiently at a low cost. Many catheters today are manufactured manually, but CathPrintâ„¢ technology presents the potential of automated production. CathPrintâ„¢ enables mass production of catheters on a cost efficient basis while ensuring quality deliverance.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The technology can be utilized in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cathprint AB provides technology license,\nproduction equipment and technical support.</li>\n<li>OEM production is done by our production partner.\nFeatures:</li>\n<li>Scalable and faster production than convention- al methods leads to a very cost-efficient out- come.</li>\n<li>High performance catheters of various\ndiameters, even as thin as 0.35mm.</li>\n<li>Multiple sensors and other electronics can be integrated.</li>\n</ol>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3405/103405v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3405/103405v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3405/103405v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Anders","last_name":"BrÃ¶ms","permalink":"anders-brms","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"MD, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Johan","last_name":"JÃ¤rte","permalink":"johan-jrte","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member, CFO and Vice President at CMA Microdialysis","person":{"first_name":"Olof","last_name":"Nord","permalink":"olof-nord","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"PhD, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Bengt","last_name":"KÃ¤llbÃ¤ck","permalink":"bengt-kllbck","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member, CEO of Svensk konstruktionstjÃ¤nst","person":{"first_name":"Johan","last_name":"Lantz","permalink":"johan-lantz","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board member","person":{"first_name":"Bengt","last_name":"MalmfÃ¤lt","permalink":"bengt-malmflt","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
