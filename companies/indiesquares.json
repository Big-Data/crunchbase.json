Despite this, the site is much more geared towards unknown bands than known bands.</p>\n\n<p>For users, there will be charts in order to see what&#8217;s popular, which will encompass IndieScope, which shows you what will become popular, and what your friends are listening to. There will also be recommendations, in which the friends that you have added can share recommendations with you, and you can share recommendations with them. There will also be, integrated into the music player, a vote feature which helps determine, along with most listened and downloaded, what gets into the charts and IndieScope.</p>\n\n<p>The aspect that most distinguishes IndieSquares from its&#8217; competitors, such as Spotify and other social music sites, is the ability for unknown bands to become heard and develop a buzz, and for users to find new music without trawling through hundreds of bad songs first. IndieSquares, also, once the initial site has earned money, is planning to launch an IndieSquares Live feature, in which monthly shows will be held featuring the best bands, at a one-off charge of Â£5 to the user for the card, and then free.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0012/7143/127143v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,36],"assets/images/resized/0012/7143/127143v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,65],"assets/images/resized/0012/7143/127143v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Robinson-Adams","permalink":"sam-robinson-adams","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CCO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Hahn","permalink":"john-hahn","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CIO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Huntesmith","permalink":"alex-huntesmith","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CWO","person":{"first_name":"Oliver","last_name":"Goldstein","permalink":"oliver-goldstein","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"iTunes/Ping","permalink":"itunes-ping-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Spotify","permalink":"spotify","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,114],"assets/images/resized/0001/7768/17768v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[97,114],"assets/images/resized/0001/7768/17768v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[97,114],"assets/images/resized/0001/7768/17768v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ReverbNation","permalink":"reverbnation","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/6867/26867v13-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/6867/26867v13-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0002/6867/26867v13-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"73 Croftdown Road,","address2":"Highgate,","zip_code":"NW5","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0012/7142/127142v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0012/7142/127142v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0012/7142/127142v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
