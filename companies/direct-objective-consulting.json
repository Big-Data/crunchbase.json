We specialize in commercialization of technology companies, manufacturing organizations, and innovative service firms.</p>\n\n<p>Direct Objective differs from a traditional B2B marketing agency in three ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Technical expertise: Our company and its leading members have backgrounds in engineering and technical R&amp;D areas. This allows our company to deliver proven marketing results, bridging between the innovation of the R&amp;D team to the target market</p></li>\n<li><p>Focus on traditional and online marketing: To attract new clients, Direct Objective is using a combined approach. While keeping up with the marketing trends, social media marketing is just one of the building block of the pull strategy that Direct Objective is offering its clients. However, many companies are now neglecting traditional media such as press releases and plugging stories in the news/media. Direct Objective maximizes your marketing ROI and can help customize the right marketing mix for your business</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>3: One-stop shop mentality: Direct Objective is not simply a consulting firm. It serves as an extension of your entire marketing and business development departments.
