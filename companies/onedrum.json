Every userâ€™s edits are displayed on each userâ€™s screen in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>oneDrum enables users to make Excel, Word or PowerPoint files saved on their own PC available to friends, family or colleagues anywhere in the world. All thatâ€™s needed is an Internet connection â€“ the person you share with does not have to have oneDrum installed.</p>\n\n<p>oneDrum stores documents on the userâ€™s PC and online, giving users 24/7 access to the latest version of their documents, whether theyâ€™re on or offline, wherever they happen to be. Any changes made by a user who is not online will be synchronised with other users (and conflicts resolved) as soon as the user connects to the Internet. </p>\n\n<p>Real Collaboration:</p>\n\n<p>oneDrum takes the compromise out of collaboration by enabling teams to work together to create professional documents in the applications theyâ€™re used to working in. </p>\n\n<p>oneDrum features contextual communication tools (e.g. IM) that enable users to coordinate and communicate change effectively â€“ treating documents as projects to which tasks and questions can be assigned.</p>\n\n<p>oneDrum works with any version of Microsoft Office (post 2000), enabling users to collaborate without disrupting their usual working practices and without the need to learn how to use new software.</p>\n\n<p>Fail-Safe Collaboration:</p>\n\n<p>oneDrum works with your existing Microsoft Office software, meaning that your technology investment is protected.</p>\n\n<p>With oneDrum, a copy of all documents created or edited is always saved locally on the userâ€™s own PC, meaning that the user does not have to entrust a third party with his or her important documents.</p>\n\n<p>oneDrum gives you complete transparency and control over who you share your documents with and the edits they make.\noneDrum uses the most robust technologies available to ensure the security of your documents.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/9740/49740v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0004/9740/49740v2-max-250x250.png"],[[280,95],"assets/images/resized/0004/9740/49740v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"oneDrum","permalink":"onedrum","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"van
