Today, health care consumes 17 percent of our economy and that is figure projected to jump to 20 percent within just the next five years.</p>\n\n<p>However, when employers and insurers look for ways to control health care costs, their choices often range from bad (raising co-pays and premiums) to worse (cutting benefits.)</p>\n\n<p>With Health Options Worldwide (HOW), health care payers now have another option, unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace. Our online healthcare management tools have been proven to reduce costs while actually improving patient satisfaction. </p>\n\n<p>Clients who work with HOW can expect to:\nâ€¢ Reduce health care costs.
