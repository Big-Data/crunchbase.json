Surfactants are produced naturally in the lungs and are essential for breathing. Discovery Labsâ€™ novel proprietary KL4 surfactant technology produces a synthetic, peptide-containing surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant and is being developed in liquid, aerosol or lyophilized formulations. In addition, Discovery Labsâ€™ proprietary capillary aerosolization technology produces a dense aerosol, with a defined particle\nsize that is capable of potentially delivering aerosolized KL4 surfactant to the deep lung without the complications currently associated with liquid surfactant administration. Discovery Labs believes that its proprietary technology platform makes it possible, for the first time, to develop a significant pipeline of surfactant products to address a variety of respiratory diseases for which there frequently are few or no approved therapies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0010/1944/101944v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0010/1944/101944v1-max-250x250.png"],[[383,105],"assets/images/resized/0010/1944/101944v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"W.","last_name":"Thomas Amick","permalink":"w-thomas-amick-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"A.
