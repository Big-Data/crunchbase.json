With hundreds of thousands of apps out there, how do you find the right app for you? Users are unable to see the full range of choices, and great new apps are nearly impossible to find. Until now.\nXyologic tackles the problem for customers and developers alike.</p>\n\n<p>We are different as we approach app search from a data driven angle.</p>\n\n<p>In the last two years we have gathered information on how users search for apps, what queries they type, how they behave. What we found is that what users love about mobile apps differs from what they love about desktop apps, with games being the most important among them. We have built different technologies for mobile apps and mobile games. Moreover, most users express generic search terms that show their struggle with traditional app search. It is our job to do the most with this little insight they give us.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,36],"assets/images/resized/0020/3584/203584v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,36],"assets/images/resized/0020/3584/203584v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,36],"assets/images/resized/0020/3584/203584v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Zoe","last_name":"Adamovicz","permalink":"zoe-adamovicz","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matthaus","last_name":"Krzykowski","permalink":"matthaus-krzykowski","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2630/202630v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2630/202630v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[338,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/2630/202630v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marcin","last_name":"Rudolf","permalink":"marcin-rudolf","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marcin","last_name":"Rudolf","permalink":"marcin-rudolf-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://gigaom.com/europe/xyologic-takes-funding-as-latest-to-improve-mobile-app-discovery/","source_description":"Xyologic takes funding as latest to improve mobile app discovery","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Signia Venture Partners","permalink":"signia-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0021/2322/212322v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,147],"assets/images/resized/0021/2322/212322v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,266],"assets/images/resized/0021/2322/212322v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Klaas","last_name":"Kersting","permalink":"klaas-kersting","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5234/35234v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5234/35234v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/5234/35234v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Company Homepage</p>"}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Wahlforss","permalink":"eric-wahlforss","image":{"available_sizes":[[[147,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2030/82030v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[246,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2030/82030v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[443,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/2030/82030v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Schwedter Strasse 23","address2":"","zip_code":"10119","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Technology Office","address1":"ul.
