Locata calls this &#8220;Your Own GPS&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>A network of terrestrially-based <strong>LocataLite</strong> beacons transmits proprietary signals which autonomously create a positioning network called a <strong>LocataNet</strong>. This network can operate in tight combination with GPS <em>or be totally independent of GPS,</em> but critically – the position information delivered by the Locata receiver is <em>exactly</em> the same as that provided by a GPS receiver. In other words – Locata’s local network delivers everything the GPS does, except the “G”. This allows a LocataNet to powerfully augment – <em>or completely replace</em> – GPS in any given area. Early adopters of Locata technology include the military, mining, construction and aviation markets. In early 2013 Locata is scheduled to release a breakthrough cm-level indoor positioning system which will revolutionize machine and forklift automation applications inside warehouses.</p>\n\n<p>Locata technology was first publicly unveiled in Portland in September 2011 at the Institute of Navigation Conference, after 16 years of stealth development. Initially, Locata&#8217;s inventions were almost universally dismissed by the industry as &#8220;impossible&#8221; – it seemed preposterous that a small private company would dare claim to replicate a system which had needed the development muscle of the entire US military, and which had cost the US taxpayer over $40 billion to put in place.</p>\n\n<p>However skepticism evaporated dramatically in mid-2012 when the US Air Force - the inventors of GPS - published a seminal article in a respected industry magazine <a href=\"http://www.insidegnss.com/node/3071\" title=\"CrunchBase\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrunchBase</a>. The long article detailed publicly for the first time that Locata had been used by the USAF <em>to replace GPS</em> across a vast area of the famed White Sands Missile Range where GPS is jammed. Apart from showing ground-breaking developments which gave Locata’s new technology irrefutable validation, the USAF article concluded, quote:</p>\n\n<p>“<em>(Locata)</em>… is <em>the key component</em> for the realization of the USAF’s next-generation Ultra High Accuracy Reference System performance in a GPS-denied environment. <em>(This system)</em> ….will become the new <strong>“gold standard truth system”</strong> for the increasingly demanding test and evaluation of future navigation and navigation warfare systems for the U.S. Department of Defense.”</p>\n\n<p>In another clear indication of the emergence of previously unachievable positioning capabilities, Leica Geosystems - one of the world’s largest and most respected GPS companies - announced they would conduct a global launch in Q3/2012 of new fleet management automation technology which was “Powered by Locata”. In the first print brochure for the new system, Leica called Locata technology “A Game Changer” and stated:\n“They said it couldn’t be done. They were wrong”. <a href=\"http://mining.leica-geosystems.com/assets/Brochures/Leica-Jps-LocataAUv2.0s.pdf\" title=\"CrunchBase\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrunchBase</a> </p>\n\n<p>Locata networks have undeniably demonstrated the unique ability to replicate a GPS satellite constellation locally - on the ground. This now allows any entity - mine, port, construction site, warehouses, airports, strategic assets - and eventually entire cities - to determine for themselves the reliability and accuracy of positioning they wish to deploy, under their own local control, with complete autonomy.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell: Locata is the inventor, developer and supplier of radically new and proven local wireless positioning signals. This new ability to supply “a local GPS” will forever change what can be done with positioning. The personalized delivery of information across cities to myriad mobile devices - as imagined by Apple, Google, Foursquare, Microsoft, and many others - now has an emerging technology base that will allow it to materialize. Locata can power new generations of positioning apps for future machine, mobile and personal devices as it is ported from today’s industrial-grade devices to cheap consumer-level GPS chips. It will enable previously inconceivable - <em>in fact truly science fiction levels</em> - of positioning performance for mobile devices. Locata has a technology roadmap in place to evolve Locata “all the way to an iPhone”.</p>\n\n<p>Locata enables a future of high-accuracy radio positioning <em>everywhere</em>. There will be no more <em>“GPS does not work here”</em> excuses. The totally unanticipated emergence of Locata marks the arrival of critically important new positioning technology which will disrupt the entire $200-billion GPS industry. <strong>Positioning will never be the same again.</strong></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/7892/127892v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0012/7892/127892v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,151],"assets/images/resized/0012/7892/127892v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Chairman & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Nunzio","last_name":"Gambale","permalink":"nunzio-gambale","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Inventor, Director of Innovation","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Small","permalink":"david-small","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager","person":{"first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Griffiths","permalink":"tony-griffiths","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager, Software","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Sainsbery","permalink":"ian-sainsbery","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Navigation","person":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"Barnes","permalink":"joel-barnes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager, Hardware","person":{"first_name":"Trevor","last_name":"Hobbs","permalink":"trevor-hobbs","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager, Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Brosius","permalink":"jay-brosius","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$22.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.epicorp.com.au/index/locatacorporation.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":7,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Epicorp Seed Fund","permalink":"epicorp-seed-fund","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.ameinfo.com/174088.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":22000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":3,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Khaleeji Commercial Bank","permalink":"khaleeji-commercial-bank","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Australian Office","address1":"111 Canberra Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"2603","city":"Griffith, ACT","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"US Office","address1":"9 Island View","address2":"","zip_code":"92604","city":"Irvine","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/algorithms-methods/innovation-hybrid-positioning-9628","title":"GPS World Magazine Article on Locata Technology - March 2010 Edition"}]}
