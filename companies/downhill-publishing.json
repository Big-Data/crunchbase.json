It was created to provide teachers, administrators, parents and students with innovative, high-quality, and timesaving classroom resources.</p>\n\n<p>About the founder</p>\n\n<p>The executive software designer, RamÃ³n Abajo, worked as a classroom teacher for almost 20 years. RamÃ³n has worked in bilingual and English-only classrooms at the elementary and secondary levels. He has received many awards, including &#8220;Teacher of the Year&#8221; in 1990 (Desert Sands Unified School District, CA). He worked as a high school technology coordinator, and played a key role in the &#8220;New Media Academy&#8221; in conjunction with the Los Angeles Workforce. He is an artist and free spirit, who finds pleasure and satisfaction in fulfilling educational needs. He is a frequent speaker at educational conferences such as CABE (California Bilingual Education), and more recently at Techno-Caribe, Puerto Rico. RamÃ³n brings a fresh approach to today&#8217;s educational challenges.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of his nearly 20 year teaching career (In Spain, The United Kingdom, and Los Angeles County, California), RamÃ³n experienced a need for uniform, easy-to-use computer software, which was both effective and affordable for teachers. He assembled a team of colleagues who joined the effort to make his vision a reality, and thus DownHill Publishing was founded.</p>\n\n<p>Primary projects</p>\n\n<p>RamÃ³n spends his time working on three innovative projects: developing high quality educational software, manufacturing revolutionary rear projection screens, and creating amusing Illuminated Manuscripts.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Software</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>DownHill Publishing&#8217;s primary focus is on developing educational software for teachers. In accordance with the demands of the education system, we have developed programs that fulfill those needs. Our seven best-selling programs are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Fonts 4 Teachers</li>\n<li>10-Minute Teachers Planner</li>\n<li>ClipArt 4 Teachers</li>\n<li>Handwriting 4 Teachers</li>\n<li>Amazing Worksheet Maker 4Teachers</li>\n<li>Nameplate maker 4 Teachers</li>\n<li>Award Maker 4 Teachers</li>\n<li>Vocabulary Builder 4 Teachers (in progress)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of seven programs are extremely useful and very cost efficient. We have donated the licensing of Fonts4Teachers to the ICON Group, who work in conjunction with the &#8220;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#8221; to create educational texts and circulate them throughout the countries of the world.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lucera Projections</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lucera Projection Display (LPD) is a high-end rear projection screen. Lucera&#8217;s stunning design and unparalleled quality attracted the attention of Dr. Gadget at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on 2006. Lucera Projection Display was shown on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Tony Danza Show&#8221; as one of &#8220;the revolutionary ways to enjoy the Super-Bowl&#8221;.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Illuminated Manuscripts</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Among his other endeavors, RamÃ³n has decided to revive the lost art of creating stunning Illuminated Manuscripts on vellum, using medieval methods and techniques. The first unique manuscript is currently in the making, and will be released in two years, after a total of 4 years of hands-on production. These books are completely unique and are unequaled in beauty and elegance.</p>\n\n<p>News Flash</p>\n\n<p>We are very happy to announce that DownHill Publishing has licensed its acclaimed Fonts4Teachers program to ICON Group International to develop e-books in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The project was created by Professor Philip M. Parker, INSEAD Chair Professor of Management Science, who is the inventor of the &#8220;smart-writing machine&#8221;, an amazing device that has allowed ICON Group to publish more than 200,000. His &#8220;K to 12 +2&#8221; project aims to create educational texts (e-book and print) in all the world&#8217;s languages, especially for the smaller languages ignored by traditional publishers. Mr. Parker is presently involved in a number of multilingual rural education projects around the world funded, in part, by the &#8220;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>DownHill Publishing commitment to social responsibility</p>\n\n<p>DownHill Publishing is committed to creating exceptional products to help change the way people across the world teach, learn, communicate, and enjoy the beauty of culture.
