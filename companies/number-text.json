For example, a Pizzeria can ask customers to text message the keyword â€œPizzaâ€ to their NumberText phone number.  Every time a customer subscribes, NumberText can automatically text them back a coupon for their next order. They can also remain in constant communication with every subscriber, sending out a text message whenever they run a new promotion or simply want to increase sales. </p>\n\n<p>NumberText can even be used to allow customers to send in their orders by texting a companyâ€™s NumberText number.</p>\n\n<p>Every subscriber is organized into group-oriented lists, making it easy to track marketing campaign growth and plan for future, hyper-targeted advertising.</p>\n\n<p>NumberText removes the need for shortcodes by giving customers their own unique, non-shared NumberText number. Companies can attract clients and organize their lists with an unlimited number of keywords. The local pizzeria can use the highly-coveted term â€œPizzaâ€ to send offers to pie lovers and â€œCalzoneâ€ to advertise to those that have shown a preference for fold-overs.</p>\n\n<p>Whether NumberText customers use one targeted keyword or 100, thereâ€™s no additional charge.  The first 100 texts sent, as well as setting up your own local number are provided for free.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0010/1229/101229v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0010/1229/101229v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,74],"assets/images/resized/0010/1229/101229v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"TextMarks","permalink":"textmarks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/4138/24138v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/4138/24138v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[254,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/4138/24138v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Utah Offices","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"84606","city":"Provo","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
