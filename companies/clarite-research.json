Its ‘roll-over’ capability then makes the subsequent analysis and reporting quick and easy.</p>\n\n<p>Clarite’s optional quantitative capability also enables clients to benchmark key issues relating to the communication as a whole - or more specific issues within it.</p>\n\n<p>End-to-end projects typically take just 7-10 days but clients in more of a hurry to identify the big issues can get access to respondent feedback in real time via the client portal.</p>\n\n<p>Clarite is available to both agencies and end-clients alike.  It can be bought and used under licence or on a fully-supported, project-by-project basis.  </p>\n\n<p>Clarite can be used to assess and optimise:\nproduct guides, brochures, leaflets\nemails \nweb pages\ncustomer service letters\nnew proposition concept boards\nadvertising story boards\nfinished TV ads\ncall centre conversation recordings and scripts</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0019/0002/190002v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0019/0002/190002v2-max-250x250.png"],[[314,119],"assets/images/resized/0019/0002/190002v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Braune","permalink":"jeremy-braune","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Priestnall","permalink":"stephen-priestnall","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"marketing and technology build","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"oomphagency","permalink":"oomphagency","image":null}},{"title":"qual research","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"brandspeak","permalink":"brandspeak","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"UK HQ","address1":"The Old Museum","address2":"Tetbury Road","zip_code":"GL7 1UP","city":"Cirencester","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
