Users then share proofs with reviewers by sending personal URLs via email, by integrating proofs in project management applications such as Basecamp and Central Desktop, or asset management products like Microsoft SharePoint and Xinet WebNative Suite, or by embedding proofs in blogs and wikis.</p>\n\n<p>Reviewers collaboratively review, mark-up and comment on the proof, all within a web browser &#8211; no local applications need to be installed, no files need to be sent.  ProofHQ lets users manage multiple versions of the same proof quickly and easily, which means that reviewers can see old versions and new versions together for easy comparison. ProofHQ manages sign-off by letting each reviewer make a decision to approve or reject the proof.</p>\n\n<p>Companies (e.g., agencies and brand companies) that handle a high volume of content, have a large number of people in the review/approval process, or who want to maintain the integrity of their brand use ProofHQ to maintain control over their process, and to have insight into where every asset is throughout that process.</p>\n\n<p>Those for whom time is a critical factor (e.g., brands, package and commercial printers, promotional product companies) use ProofHQ to reduce the number of revisions and shorten the approval process.</p>\n\n<p>Companies that are heavily regulated (e.g., healthcare and financial services) rely on ProofHQ to provide a record of activity for each prove, to prove compliance.</p>\n\n<p>And anyone charged with maintaining important client relationships (e.g., account managers) benefit from the improved collaboration and communication only possible with online proofing from ProofHQ.</p>\n\n<p>ProofHQ has a subscription model, which includes a 14-day free trial, and a variety of plans to suit any size company.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/4315/14315v1-max-150x150.png"],[[193,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/4315/14315v1-max-250x250.png"],[[193,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/4315/14315v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mat","last_name":"Atkinson","permalink":"mat-atkinson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Welgemoed","permalink":"anthony-welgemoed","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Colin","last_name":"Angus","permalink":"colin-angus","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ConceptShare","permalink":"conceptshare","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/2988/22988v4-max-150x150.png"],[[217,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/2988/22988v4-max-250x250.png"],[[217,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/2988/22988v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.500152,"longitude":-0.126236}],"milestones":[{"description":"Proof HQ Launches in Beta","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":5,"source_url":"","source_text":"","source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"ProofHQ","permalink":"proofhq"}},{"description":"Formal launch","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"ProofHQ","permalink":"proofhq"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/23157584?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/6853/36853v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0003/6853/36853v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,294],"assets/images/resized/0003/6853/36853v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/9196/139196v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/9196/139196v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0013/9196/139196v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0013/9353/139353v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,179],"assets/images/resized/0013/9353/139353v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,323],"assets/images/resized/0013/9353/139353v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
