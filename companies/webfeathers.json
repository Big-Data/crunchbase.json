There are some pretty simple rules to follow, and like any specialized service profession: once you know these rules the rest comes naturally.</p>\n\n<p>There are several Web Designers in Redding, so why shoud you choose WebFeathers for Web Design or Web Hosting? In one word: Experience.</p>\n\n<p>I have been building Web Sites since 1997. In 2000, I moved to the Bay Area where I spent 10 years working for the Big Guys. I worked on the Global Corporate Web Site for VeriSign as well as the Intranet, several Extranets and countless promotional web sites.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006 I started working for Yahoo! Search. While at Yahoo!, I learned about building Web Sites with a Semantec Approach, where we only use the code relevant to the content of your site (this helps in Search Engine Optimization). Semantec Web Sites are cleaner, faster, and better ranked in Search Engines.</p>\n\n<p>But that is only a small look at where our experience comes from. Please check out some of WebFeathers&#8217; clients.</p>\n\n<p>We can help with everything from correcting typos or just regular maintenance on your existing website to building secure eCommerce websites. We offer very affordable Web Hosting, Domain Names, Web Design&#8230; whatever you need! In short, we can help you build your site, and make it the best it can be, and not break the bank doing it.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/1956/41956v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,114],"assets/images/resized/0004/1956/41956v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,206],"assets/images/resized/0004/1956/41956v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","person":{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"Feathers","permalink":"ron-feathers","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"WebFeathers, Inc.","address1":"21788 Mel Mar Dr.","address2":"","zip_code":"96073","city":"Palo Cedro","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.5433263,"longitude":-122.2406391}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
