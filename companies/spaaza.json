This information is then published through the following main channels:</p>\n\n<p>i) Spaaza API - a fully searchable JSON-based local product search and information retrieval interface which developers can use to integrate product and inventory information into their apps and services.</p>\n\n<p>ii) Spaaza Facebook app - an app which retailers can install on their Facebook page and which functions as a product catalogue, showing which products are in stock in which stores.</p>\n\n<p>iii) Spaaza site widget - widget which can be installed on a retailer&#8217;s e-commerce or catalogue site and shows in-store availability of products shown on the site in individual stores or across chains up to international level.</p>\n\n<p>iv) Google Shopping - a tool for pushing inventory information into Google&#8217;s Shopping APIs.</p>\n\n<p>Spaaza is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and operates in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Critchley","permalink":"sam-critchley","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0018/1387/181387v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0018/1387/181387v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0018/1387/181387v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Sevenoaks","permalink":"dave-sevenoaks","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Milo","permalink":"milo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0004/2698/42698v6-max-150x150.png"],[[175,113],"assets/images/resized/0004/2698/42698v6-max-250x250.png"],[[175,113],"assets/images/resized/0004/2698/42698v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Retailigence","permalink":"retailigence","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0009/6394/96394v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/6394/96394v8-max-250x250.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/6394/96394v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Goodzer","permalink":"goodzer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0010/5608/105608v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0010/5608/105608v7-max-250x250.png"],[[260,200],"assets/images/resized/0010/5608/105608v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Amsterdam HQ","address1":"Wibautstraat 150","address2":"","zip_code":"1091GR","city":"Amsterdam","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0018/1345/181345v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0018/1345/181345v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0018/1345/181345v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,134],"assets/images/resized/0018/1346/181346v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,223],"assets/images/resized/0018/1346/181346v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,402],"assets/images/resized/0018/1346/181346v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/09/20/30-second-start-up-pitches-in-amsterdam/","title":"Wall Street Journal Europe - startup tour"},{"external_url":"http://fd.nl/entrepreneur/young-entrepreneur/563155-1203/nieuwe-app-moet-weg-naar-stenen-winkel-wijzen","title":"Financieele Dagblad article"},{"external_url":"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Ffd.nl%2Fentrepreneur%2Fyoung-entrepreneur%2F563155-1203%2Fnieuwe-app-moet-weg-naar-stenen-winkel-wijzen&act=url","title":"Financieele Dagblad - Google translation"}]}
