Publishing made straight simple. </p>\n\n<p>It offers readers a constant growing source of reading material and indie authors; and authors the chance of selfpublishing eBooks, have direct contact with a mass of readers, decide prices, retain copyright ownership and 100% of sales.</p>\n\n<p>100% of sales for authors? Yes. We use an internal currency called Credits, and each of them is worth USD 1. We charge readers a commision everytime they buy credits. Once authors sold their eBooks and accumulate credits, they can use those to buy other eBooks, use our services to promote, enhance and sell their content in different plataforms; or just trade their credits for cash. </p>\n\n<p>Liibook&#8217;s being incubated by Wayra Startup Accelerator until May 2012 and growing at amazing rates.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0016/7219/167219v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0016/7219/167219v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,197],"assets/images/resized/0016/7219/167219v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Federico","last_name":"Roma","permalink":"federico-roma","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"Micha","permalink":"sebastian-micha-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"Micha","permalink":"sebastian-micha","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Ignacio","last_name":"Roizman","permalink":"ignacio-roizman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ - Wayra Argentina","address1":"Costa Rica 5546","address2":"","zip_code":"1414","city":"Buenos Aires","state_code":null,"country_code":"ARG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Winner of Wayra 2011 - Awarded with incubation and seed capital.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.wayra.org/es/blog/wayra-anuncio-10-proyectos-elegidos-primera-wayraweek-argentina","source_text":null,"source_description":"Wayra anunci√≥ los 10 proyectos elegidos en la primera wayraWeek Argentina.","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Liibook","permalink":"liibook"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
