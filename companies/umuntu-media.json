Traffic, crime reports, sport, chat etc. The media owner knows best what the audience wants. \nThey then activate their current SMS lines, Twitter feeds and soon Facebook, Instagram, Mxit, and other communication channels on the board and now the audience can add notes to the noticeboard from any of these channels. \nThe media owner then embeds this virtual noticeboard with all the conversations into their Websites, Facebook pages and mobiles sites and or apps (coming soon) \nNow the conversation happens on the media owners&#8217; site\nMonetization models happens in three ways:\nBoard cover ad. This is a premium ad spot on the Mimiboard that our sales teams monetize. We then share revenue back to the board owner (Live now)\nNetwork ads. We have signed an agreement with an Ad Network on API level. This will automatically monetize the board. The ad will look like a note on the board. (Live in Jan) We share revenue back to the board owner\nFeatured notes: This is an exciting one. Gravity pushes notes down really fast if your board is active. The audience of the media owner now has the opportunity to place a featured note on their favorite site&#8217;s board. The board owner sets the CPM. The advertiser pays for the ad via carrier billing. (Live in Jan) \nMimiboard puts the attention back in the hands of the media owner and builds a monetization ecosystem around that. Its a hyper-local ad network that facilitates content creation and conversation. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0022/4112/224112v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0022/4112/224112v2-max-250x250.png"],[[338,94],"assets/images/resized/0022/4112/224112v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$150k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"eVA Fund","permalink":"eva-fund","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Loopstreet 16","address2":"CBD","zip_code":"8000","city":"Cape Town","state_code":null,"country_code":"ZAF","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/50976888\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50976888\">Mimiboard.
