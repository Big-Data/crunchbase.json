It features highly-connected, high net worth accredited investors as its limited partners, and targets top startups featuring strong teams, high growth, and compelling market opportunities. FundersClubs’ limited partners include noted startup investors as well as operators at top public and private companies globally, with an estimated personal net worth of at least $8 billion. Each funded FundersClub startup benefits from the capital, the advice, and the professional networks of its associated venture fund, which includes up to 95 value-added limited partners. However, the startups are spared from the overhead of interfacing with a crowd of investors by receiving capital in a traditional venture capital format from a conventional venture fund.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0020/6496/206496v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0020/6496/206496v1-max-250x250.png"],[[350,90],"assets/images/resized/0020/6496/206496v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Mittal","permalink":"alex-mittal","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & President","person":{"first_name":"Boris","last_name":"Silver","permalink":"boris-silver-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Pejman","last_name":"Nozad","permalink":"pejman-nozad","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/9494/99494v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[173,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/9494/99494v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[173,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/9494/99494v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development ","person":{"first_name":"Felicia","last_name":"Curcuru","permalink":"felicia-curcuru","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/16/funders-club-raises-over-1m-for-startups-online-including-itself/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Venturebeat_deals+%28VentureBeat+%C2%BB+Deals%29","source_description":"Funders Club raises over $1M for startups online — including itself","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":16,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/19/fundersclub-seed-round/","source_description":"To Turn The Crowd Into Venture Capitalists, FundersClub Raises $6M Seed Round -- Biggest In YC History","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":19,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
