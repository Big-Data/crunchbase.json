The company&#8217;s current apps include:</p>\n\n<p>Blacktop: an iPhone app that lets users organize your Facebook and Foursquare check-ins into &#8220;trips&#8221;â€”with maps, photos, and commentsâ€”that can be shared with friends in real-time. (DISCONTINUED)</p>\n\n<p>Phizviz: creates a visualization of your Facebook check-ins, week-by-week. You can page through weeks and compare them.</p>\n\n<p>Zenbe Lists: lets users share task lists from their iPhone, iPad, or the web. It was one of the first 300 iPhone apps and was called &#8220;our favorite task list&#8221; by Gizmodo. (DISCONTINUED with no announcement. Server has been down for weeks with no word from Zenbe, and now their main website is down.)</p>\n\n<p>Shareflow is a simple, real-time group collaboration tool that enables groups to share ideas, files, and more, without the hassles of long email threads.</p>\n\n<p>Zenbe was founded in 2007 and produced a next-generation webmail suite, Zenbe Mail, which was discontinued in 2010 following a partial talent acquisition by Facebook.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/7847/17847v7-max-150x150.png"],[[154,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/7847/17847v7-max-250x250.png"],[[154,43],"assets/images/resized/0001/7847/17847v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Zenbe Mail","permalink":"zenbe","image":null},{"name":"Zenbe Lists iPhone App","permalink":"zenbe-lists-iphone-app","image":null},{"name":"Shareflow","permalink":"shareflow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0005/4229/54229v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/4229/54229v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/4229/54229v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Alison","permalink":"tom-alison","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Chung","permalink":"alan-chung","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Stern","permalink":"peter-stern","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/0274/90274v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/0274/90274v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,258],"assets/images/resized/0009/0274/90274v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Kieffer","permalink":"robert-kieffer","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"User Experience Designer","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Harlow","permalink":"jay-harlow","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Google","permalink":"google","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Xoopit","permalink":"xoopit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/6605/16605v3-max-150x150.png"],[[171,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6605/16605v3-max-250x250.png"],[[171,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6605/16605v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Xobni","permalink":"xobni","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/0568/568v2-max-150x150.png"],[[198,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0568/568v2-max-250x250.png"],[[198,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0568/568v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-zenbe-2010-11","source_description":"Facebook Buys Yet Another NYC Startup -- Why Doesn't It Just Open An Engineering Office Here Already?","acquired_year":2010,"acquired_month":11,"acquired_day":16,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"156 Reade Street","address2":"","zip_code":"10013","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.716884,"longitude":-74.010355}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
