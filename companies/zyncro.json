Integrated with all the company&#8217;s corporate management systems, with complete personalization and customization options, including commercialization as a white label product, available as a cloud-hosted (public or private) or on-premises solution.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Zyncro is an Enterprise Social Network, a private work environment for sharing information confidentially and securely, containing a social microblogging system, a document repository, a task manager, and a professional contact agenda. </p>\n\n<p>Zyncro integrates with the leading business management tools:\n  *SharePoint\n  *ERPs, such as SAP\n  *BI systems (Pentaho, Google Analytics) and CRMs\n  *Project management tools, like Doolphy\n  *Google Apps: Gmail, Calendar and Drive\n  *Social Networks: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, RSS and YouTube\n  *Other corporate web applications: Evernote, SurveyMonkey\n  *With any web content generator&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>Zyncro uses social technology to enable organizations to:</p>\n\n<p>*optimize and reduce email use\n  *improve internal knowledge retainment and management\n  *make teamwork more efficient\n  *motivate and involve employees in the corporate mission\n  *provide access to corporate information and documents.</p>\n\n<p>As well as being an enterprise social network, Zyncro can act as a Private Social Network, a space for collaboration and communication, perfect for any organization looking to build private social relationship with its customers, suppliers or partners&#8230; where contents and information generated do not belong to third parties (unlike Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) but to the users.</p>\n\n<p>Zyncro also has a multi-organization structure, making it a ideal solution not only for single enterprises, but for groups and business communities looking for a common space to share information, news, files, contacts and applications.</p>\n\n<p>The original Zyncro idea back in 2008 in the Grupo Inspirit technology laboratory consisted in creating a files synchronizer that would allow and individual to access all of their professional and personal documents &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;.  Nonetheless, upon seeing the potential that this tool could have within a company, a more corporate approach was given to it each time.  At the same time, the &#8220;surname&#8221; social and the 2.0 style was inundating the Internet and it was then that the decision was taken to add collaborative and communicative functionalities to it that later converted it to what it is today: an intranet 2.0 or company social network.  This part of Zyncro‘s trajectory is what Didac Lee, founder of Grupo Inspirit, considers the a &#8220;Journey accross the desert&#8221;, which all startups must endure.  Thanks to the appointment of Luis Font as Zyncro CEO in November 2010, the business strategy and product definition became polished and sales and marketing departments were consolidated until we became what we are today.  And still on the uprise! </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0009/0749/90749v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/0749/90749v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0009/0749/90749v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Lluis","last_name":"Font","permalink":"lluis-font","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€2.8M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/04/zyncro-raises-12m.html","source_description":"Zyncro Raises €1.2M","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":5,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Cabiedes & Partners","permalink":"cabiedes-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2480/172480v2-max-150x150.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2480/172480v2-max-250x250.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2480/172480v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/02/zyncro-closes-e1-6m-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Zyncro Closes €1.6M Second Round of Financing","raised_amount":1600000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":3,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Active Venture Partners","permalink":"active-capital-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0001/1813/11813v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,130],"assets/images/resized/0001/1813/11813v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,235],"assets/images/resized/0001/1813/11813v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Caixa Capital","permalink":"caixa-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0004/6124/46124v1-max-150x150.png"],[[172,116],"assets/images/resized/0004/6124/46124v1-max-250x250.png"],[[172,116],"assets/images/resized/0004/6124/46124v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Cabiedes & Partners","permalink":"cabiedes-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2480/172480v2-max-150x150.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2480/172480v2-max-250x250.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2480/172480v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Passeig de Gràcia 120, 1 Dcha.","address2":"","zip_code":"08008","city":"Barcelona","state_code":null,"country_code":"ESP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0009/0746/90746v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0009/0746/90746v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0009/0746/90746v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/0747/90747v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0009/0747/90747v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,156],"assets/images/resized/0009/0747/90747v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0009/0748/90748v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0009/0748/90748v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0009/0748/90748v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
