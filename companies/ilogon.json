For instance, a user may select Wall Street Journal, ESPN Insider, Consumer Reports, or other premium subscription based sites. iLogon will bill the user one subscription fee that is about 5%-10% lower than the aggregate cost if they went to each site directly to sign up. Once the user creates the package, they will use iLogon as the launching point for all the sites in their package.</p>\n\n<p>They are building a portfolio of sites now for a public beta launch in December of this year. iLogon is basically a reseller for the partner site. However, they manage the user and accepting payment, which is different from a typical Affiliate program. iLogon negotiates a revenue split of the subscription fees with each partner site.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits to the User:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One place to manage all premium subscriptions</li>\n<li>Easy to find premium sites based on category, search, tags, etc</li>\n<li>User reviews to help find the best premium sites</li>\n<li>One account and password for all premium sites</li>\n<li>Only have to enter credit card number in one place</li>\n<li>Discounted subscription fees (bundled rate) for multiple sites</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Benefits to the Partner Site:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Additional Channel to sell subscriptions to the site</li>\n<li>More paying users/subscriptions</li>\n<li>Targeted User base (the right demographics, users willing to pay for content/services, etc)</li>\n<li>iLogon spends the marketing dollars for these new users - &#8220;free users&#8221; to the partner</li>\n<li>iLogon manages the user account and billing (including CC fees)</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/4952/24952v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/4952/24952v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0002/4952/24952v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Argenziano","permalink":"anthony-argenziano","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0002/4954/24954v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0002/4954/24954v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0002/4954/24954v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Anthony Argenziano</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CSO","person":{"first_name":"Carl","last_name":"Kaiser","permalink":"carl-kaiser","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Architect","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Fye","permalink":"david-fye","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Flangos","permalink":"peter-flangos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Kaiser","permalink":"jim-kaiser","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Irons","permalink":"steve-irons","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Pageonce","permalink":"pageonce","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0000/3085/3085v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[171,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3085/3085v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[171,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3085/3085v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Network Solutions","permalink":"networksolutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0001/3734/13734v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/3734/13734v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/3734/13734v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Synacor","permalink":"synacor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0006/3325/63325v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0006/3325/63325v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/3325/63325v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Wright Law Group","permalink":"wright-law-group","image":null}},{"title":"Taxes/Accounting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Mountainside CPA","permalink":"mountainside-cpa","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$50k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Self-Funded","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":25,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
