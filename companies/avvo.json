The resume scoring depends on those indicators of the professional&#8217;s quality of work, reputation and experience.  The scoring ranges from 10 (â€œSuperbâ€) all the way down to 1 (â€œExtreme Cautionâ€). </p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2007, Avvo is privately held, with funding from private investors, Benchmark Capital, Ignition Partners and DAG Ventures.
