The intention is to pick up where MySpace and Facebook left offâ€”a home designed by football fans and for football fans.</p>\n\n<p>MyGridIronSpace.com is on a mission to bring football fans togetherâ€”from the youth level all the way up to the NFL. </p>\n\n<p>The website is designed to be a home where fans can receive all of the latest information and news on a huge variety of subjects, ranging across the spectrum from coaching Youth Football to the hottest NFL news and rumors.</p>\n\n<p>The initial goal of MyGridIronSpace.com is to reach out to anyone that has an interest in Football and spreading their knowledge throughout the Internet. Whether they want to host their own Blog, write an article, show off their photos, upload videos, or just chat with other Football fans,</p>\n\n<p>MyGridIronSpace.com is just the place. </p>\n\n<p>MyGridIronSpace.com is partnering up with a representative of each NFL team&#8217;s FanSite. Only one FanSite for each team will be a &#8220;Featured FanSite.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>MyGridIronSpace is going through the exhaustive process of identifying these top-quality sites and entering into a partnership with them.</p>\n\n<p>Members will be able to go to their favorite Team&#8217;s NFL Division page and have immediate access to the Featured FanSites portal. This will provide them with the latest information from that site, along with their most recent forum posts.</p>\n\n<p>Ron Block, the founder of MyGridIronSpace, has been designing Web Sites since 1995 and launched an extremely successful NY Jets FanSite, NYJetsFan.com, back in 2002 as a way to reach out to Jets&#8217; fans looking for a home on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Ron Block was quoted as saying, &#8220;MyGridIronSpace.com goes to that next level where MySpace and Facebook left off. The problem with those two sites is that Football Fans don&#8217;t have enough of an identity mixed within the masses.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;On MyGridIronSpace, they will be amongst their own kind, and in a world dedicated to the Football Fanatics.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>There is absolutely no cost involved with having a membership on MyGridIronSpace.com. A Fanatic will have full control over their profile and loads of featuresâ€”including, but not limited to Video Chat, Instant Messenger (with video), Whiteboard, Classifieds, User Defined Groups, Events, Blogs, Articles, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>MyGridIronSpace.com had a private launch in early December, but word has spread rapidly, and with all the features available, the site is on the fast track to becoming the definitive destination for football fans at any level.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0004/1850/41850v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0004/1850/41850v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/1850/41850v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"<MyGridIronSpace.com","permalink":"mygridironspace-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"Block","permalink":"ron-block","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/4565/34565v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,127],"assets/images/resized/0003/4565/34565v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,229],"assets/images/resized/0003/4565/34565v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0004/1851/41851v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0004/1851/41851v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0004/1851/41851v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/94090-new-football-website-brings-social-networking-to-another-level-for-true-fanatics","title":"Bleacher Report"},{"external_url":"http://www.pr.com/press-release/126987","title":"PR.com"}]}
