Convenient and customizable, the multi-sensor Basis Band collects data like heart rate, calories burned, physical activity and sleep patterns. It links wirelessly to your personal dashboard where you can easily view performance, share data, earn rewards, and engage with the Basis community. </p>\n\n<p>Basis is backed by Norwest Venture Partners and Doll Capital Management.
