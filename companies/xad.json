Across its network, xAd aggregates and manages nearly half a billion location-specific ad requests per month, billions of business listings, and over one million national and local advertisers.</p>\n\n<p>Its proprietary technology and quality-score algorithm, which takes into account nearly 30 variables such as user behavior and search location, deliver local and contextual relevance for better advertising performance: monetized calls, clicks and visits generated from ads across the mobile Web, owned and operated local apps, publisher partners, and mapping and navigation systems. That comprehensive ad inventory facilitates higher conversions for advertisers, who can reach a vast mobile audience with a single touch point, while publishers can experience high eCPM and also access a large, accurate database in one location.</p>\n\n<p>Based in San Francisco, xAd has research and development facilities in Sunnyvale, California, and Gurgaon, India, as well as a sales center in Charlotte and several satellite offices across the U.S. For more information, visit
