However, in this case the payment doesn&#8217;t go to a webmaster for referring the sale - it goes straight to the consumer. In fact, Jellyfish shares at least 50% of the commission with the buyer. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, advertisers are ranked by how much they&#8217;ll pay the customer for buying their product; these discounts can be as high as 24%. </p>\n\n<p>There are various online (social) shopping networks; some include: <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaboodle\" title=\"Kaboodle\">Kaboodle</a>, <a href=\"http://zlio.com/\" title=\"Zlio\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zlio</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mypicklist.com/\" title=\"MyPickList\" rel=\"nofollow\">MyPickList</a>, <a href=\"http://wists.com/\" title=\"Wists\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wists</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ideeli\" title=\"Ideeli\">Ideeli</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0000/2971/2971v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/2971/2971v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/2971/2971v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"jellyfish","permalink":"jellyfish","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Wiegand","permalink":"brian-wiegand","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/5055/25055v2-max-150x150.png"],[[75,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/5055/25055v2-max-250x250.png"],[[75,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/5055/25055v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President and Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Mcguire","permalink":"mark-mcguire","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8225/28225v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/8225/28225v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/8225/28225v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Woot","permalink":"woot","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0000/3124/3124v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,243],"assets/images/resized/0000/3124/3124v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,438],"assets/images/resized/0000/3124/3124v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Teet","permalink":"teet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/6821/16821v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[126,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/6821/16821v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[126,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/6821/16821v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/27/cpa-shopping-search-jellyfishcom-closes-5-million-round/","source_description":"CPA Shopping Search Jellyfish Closes $5 Million Round","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Clyde Street Investments","permalink":"clyde-street-investments","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Kegonsa Capital Partners","permalink":"kegonsa-capital-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0005/5129/55129v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0005/5129/55129v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,43],"assets/images/resized/0005/5129/55129v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":50000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://wistechnology.com/articles/4215/","source_description":"Microsoft Buys Jellyfish","acquired_year":2007,"acquired_month":10,"acquired_day":3,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"1600 Aspen Commons, Suite 950","address2":null,"zip_code":"53562","city":"Middleton","state_code":"WI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
