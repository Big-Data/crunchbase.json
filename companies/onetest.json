Onetest&#8217;s products and services aim to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a highly automated and objective recruitment process</li>\n<li>Eliminate the need for recruiters and outside agencies</li>\n<li>Deliver better quality hires who are more productive on the job</li>\n<li>Identify individuals who are likely to be safer, smarter and more reliable</li>\n<li>Ensure improved retention and higher morale.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With more than 800 psychometric assessments and skills tests, Onetest makes it possible to quickly and objectively filter applicants against a defined set of criteria, so that you only interview qualified candidates.  Assessments cover attributes such as basic intelligence as well as job specific skills.</p>\n\n<p>The use of online assessments can be supported by a fully automated eRecruitment system that integrates with web-based job sites and reduces routine tasks such as applicant sorting and communication.  This allows your professional HR personnel to focus on more meaningful activities with the most qualified candidates.</p>\n\n<p>Once the best candidates have been identified, further testing can be undertaken to ensure fit with the companyâ€™s culture and values.  Additionally, for jobs in manufacturing, mining and other industries where safety is a major concern, a test to determine risk behaviour can be administered.  For retail, call centre and other similar roles, integrity testing is often valuable in the selection process. </p>\n\n<p>The end result is lower recruitment costs, better quality hires, reduced employee turnover, and increased profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the services Onetest offers include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cognitive Ability Test</li>\n<li>Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)</li>\n<li>Work Safety Assessment</li>\n<li>Work Reliability Scale</li>\n<li>Behavioural Profile</li>\n<li>Values Inventory</li>\n<li>Work Preferences Profile</li>\n<li>16PF</li>\n<li>360Â° Leadership Appraisals</li>\n<li>360Â° Performance Appraisals</li>\n<li>Employee Engagement Surveys</li>\n<li>Exit Interviews</li>\n<li>Employee Development System</li>\n<li>eRecruitment</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0009/2057/92057v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/2057/92057v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,269],"assets/images/resized/0009/2057/92057v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Clarkson","permalink":"matthew-clarkson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/3053/193053v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/3053/193053v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[283,283],"assets/images/resized/0019/3053/193053v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"Kerr","permalink":"rachel-kerr","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Client Solutions","person":{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"Lock","permalink":"naomi-lock","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Hopkins","permalink":"paul-hopkins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Psychology","person":{"first_name":"Cherie","last_name":"Curtis","permalink":"cherie-curtis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Vass","last_name":"Malanos","permalink":"vass-malanos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Client Solutions","person":{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"Lock","permalink":"naomi-lock-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Richards","permalink":"john-richards-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Brisbane (Head Office)","address1":"1/21 Windorah St","address2":"","zip_code":"4053","city":"Stafford QLD","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Sydney","address1":"Suite 3207, Level 32","address2":"88 Phillip Street","zip_code":"2000","city":"Sydney NSW","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Melbourne","address1":"141 Burnley St","address2":"","zip_code":"3121","city":"Richmond VIC","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Canberra","address1":"Level 11","address2":"60 Marcus Clarke St","zip_code":"2601","city":"Canberra ACT","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CTP96uaMiRU&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CTP96uaMiRU&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>TV Interview</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.qbr.com.au/news/articleid/62294.aspx","title":"Onetest Founder Hands Reins to New CEO"},{"external_url":"http://www.smartcompany.com.au/entrepreneur-watch/20091030-what-workers-want.html","title":"What Workers Want"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTP96uaMiRU","title":"TV Interview"},{"external_url":"http://dev.hcamag.com/news/what-fresh-graduates-want-now-survey/39316","title":"What Fresh Graduates Want"},{"external_url":"http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/articles/articles-news/employees-value-job-stability-over-money-survey4615.html","title":"Employees value job stability over money: survey"},{"external_url":"http://m.zdnet.com.au/e-cruitment-drivers-120278903.htm","title":"eRecruitment Drivers"}]}
