Evenium&#8217;s relational technology makes events more efficient in terms of relational marketing, acquisition and client fidelity.  </p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2011, ConnexMe (Evenium&#8217;s mobile app) provides event attendees with the opportunity to share their reactions and event content in real time during the event.
