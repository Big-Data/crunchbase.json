Providing white-label services for brands and content providers to engage nationwide audiences during live TV shows, sporting events, and political debates. Loyalize converts passive viewers into active participants, playing games, answering polls, discussing and sharing with other viewers right from their smart phones, tablets, laptops, and  connected TVs. Participants are awarded badges and loyalty points, redeemable for real rewards with a powerful redemption portal. </p>\n\n<p>Loyalize’s value was cracking the Social TV problem:  how to engage the audience for a long period of time, driving higher monetization.  While many companies in 2011 focused on “check-in” (getting users to specify what shows they were watching), Loyalize focused on driving real-time interactive experiences, building various ways to engage the audience for long periods of time.  The “secret sauce” for Loyalize is the “Director’s Console” product.  The Director’s Console allows the TV network to control what appears on everyone’s smartphone, tablet and laptop based on what’s happening on the screen.  The Director’s Console is unique in that it can drive a dynamic experience on phones/tablets during live shows such as sporting events, award shows, reality shows and more.  </p>\n\n<p>Loyalize has had  great traction. Fortune 500 Customers included: Motorola Mobility, Yahoo!7 and Viacom/MTV.</p>\n\n<p>Loyalize was behind the scenes of largest successful SocialTV debuts, such as: Superbowl’12 and Grammy’s 2012 live events as well as Australia Open, CES’12  live show, and The Deadliest Warrior finale on SpikeTV (MTV).</p>\n\n<p>One great success story of Loyalize is  Yahoo!7. Seven Networks – In Australia, launching Loyalize under the brand “Fango” in Australia. Fango (Loyalize) Quickly became a hit and #1 iphone app and #1 iPad app Apple store of Australia. </p>\n\n<p>Fango drove events like The Australia Open and other live shows, as well as many top-tier shows like X-Factor, Beauty and the Geek and Home and Away.  Extending beyond the top-tier shows, Yahoo!7 also uses Loyalize to provide interactive experiences, content, and social chat for every TV episode on every TV channel in Australia, approximately 750 shows per week.  This has enabled the Loyalize brand to reach the #1 Entertainment App on the iTunes app store in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>Watch Loyalize / Yahoo (FANGO) in action:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od0S6vi7qDw </p>\n\n<p>In Dec’11 Loyalize was acquired by the publicly-traded company Function(X) [FNCX:OTC US],  running leading TV loyalty app Viggle</p>\n\n<p>With a capitalization of $1B, Function(X) is currently the largest SocialTV player.
