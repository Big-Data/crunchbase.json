In addition, Fundable makes investing more accessible, providing two ways for backers to support companies – through rewards or equity.</p>\n\n<p>Backers earn rewards such as product pre-orders, unique gifts, or special incentives by the companies’ founders in exchange for pledging capital. For larger investments, startups may also offer equity in their companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0018/4924/184924v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0018/4924/184924v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0018/4924/184924v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Wil","last_name":"Schroter","permalink":"wil-schroter-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/9833/209833v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/9833/209833v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/9833/209833v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"The Point","permalink":"the-point","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/1878/11878v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/1878/11878v1-max-250x250.png"],[[273,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/1878/11878v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"WujWuj","permalink":"wujwuj","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0001/8782/18782v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0001/8782/18782v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[345,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/8782/18782v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"from: Everyone","permalink":"fromeveryone","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0003/6051/36051v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,101],"assets/images/resized/0003/6051/36051v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,101],"assets/images/resized/0003/6051/36051v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"HomeSlyce","permalink":"homeslyce","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0003/6052/36052v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/6052/36052v1-max-250x250.png"],[[325,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/6052/36052v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ChipIn","permalink":"chipin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0733/20733v1-max-150x150.png"],[[127,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0733/20733v1-max-250x250.png"],[[127,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0733/20733v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kickstarter","permalink":"kickstarter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0011/6725/116725v1-max-150x150.png"],[[188,39],"assets/images/resized/0011/6725/116725v1-max-250x250.png"],[[188,39],"assets/images/resized/0011/6725/116725v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"","source_description":"Domain Purchased","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":1,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Virtucon Ventures","permalink":"virtucon-ventures","image":null}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Fundable LLC","address1":"1322 Manning Parkway","address2":"","zip_code":"43065","city":"Powell","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":30.282906,"longitude":-97.742385}],"milestones":[{"description":"Launched","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":22,"source_url":"http://mashable.com/2012/05/22/fundable/","source_text":null,"source_description":"This Kickstarter for Startups Will Trade Equity for Funding","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Fundable.com","permalink":"fundable-com"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2012/05/22/fundable/","title":"Mashable"},{"external_url":"http://gigaom.com/2012/05/22/fundable-debuts-as-a-kickstarter-for-corporate-set/","title":"GigaOm"},{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/05/22/fundable-launches-to-take-on-startup-crowdfunding-fusing-circleup-and-kickstarter-into-a-single-platform/","title":"TNW"},{"external_url":"http://betakit.com/2012/05/22/fundable-mixes-kickstarter-style-and-equity-based-crowdfunding?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+betakit+(BetaKit)","title":"BetaKit"}]}
