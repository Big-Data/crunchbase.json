They recognized that an environment of rapidly changing market conditions and scarce skilled human resources mandated streamlined business processes. We helped our clients accomplish this by re-engineering and automating service chain processes within their businesses. In the course of their work, they created software application frameworks that produce highly responsive management and workflow environments, which automate the sales delivery and measurement processes of the service organization. These business software solutions are marketed under the trademarks Tracker Suite http://www.TrackerSuite.com and TrackerOffice http://www.trackeroffice.com and are based on Lotus Notes / Domino and Microsoft / Exchange platforms, respectively.
