We take the social interaction a step further by integrating with Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare (which allows you to check-in to a location via the Foursquare API). One of the things that sets us  apart from most other social networks is that we focus on the niche of beer drinkers, so the audience you can target is not only interested in beer, but have been age verified to be of legal drinking age in their respective country.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to allowing users to share their beer experiences and discoveries, we offer a variety of badges to entice the community to explore, as well as brag. The criteria for earning badges varies and must be completed before the badge is awarded. These can range from drinking a certain number of or variety of beers, drinking in a certain location(s), drinking between certain time periods, or even a combination of them all.</p>\n\n<p>We will soon offer a wide variety of tools for breweries and venues to track and interact with users.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0010/9722/109722v2-max-150x150.png"],[[181,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/9722/109722v2-max-250x250.png"],[[181,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/9722/109722v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CEO, Designer","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Mather","permalink":"tim-mather","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CTO, Developer","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Avola","permalink":"greg-avola","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8994/118994v2-max-150x150.png"],[[238,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8994/118994v2-max-250x250.png"],[[247,259],"assets/images/resized/0011/8994/118994v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>http://gregavola.me</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Brenden","last_name":"Mulligan","permalink":"brenden-mulligan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/3640/43640v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/3640/43640v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/3640/43640v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Galligan","permalink":"matt-galligan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4065/24065v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/4065/24065v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/4065/24065v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dustinhenderlong/5629928080/\" title=\"Dustin Henderlong\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dustin Henderlong</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Vajda","permalink":"john-vajda","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/4286/104286v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/4286/104286v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[336,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/4286/104286v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"foursquare","permalink":"foursquare","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-250x250.png"],[[442,122],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Untappd surpasses 1,000,000 beer check-ins","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":3,"source_url":"http://blog.untappd.com/post/6146514877/one-million-check-ins","source_text":null,"source_description":"One Million Check-Ins!","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Untappd","permalink":"untappd"}},{"description":"Untappd native apps release for iPhone & Android devices.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/30/untappd-takes-their-social-beer-service-to-ios-android/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Untappd Takes Their Social Neer Service to iOS/Android","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Untappd","permalink":"untappd"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0013/9535/139535v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,214],"assets/images/resized/0013/9535/139535v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,385],"assets/images/resized/0013/9535/139535v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9538/139538v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/9538/139538v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/9538/139538v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2010/11/06/untappd/","title":""}]}
