With unparalleled access to the Twitter and Facebook data streams, the company developed the SocialFlow AttentionScoreâ„¢ technology that is able to understand and quantify audience, attention, topics and engagement to provide an accurate value assessment of social media content for brands and businesses.  This technology powers the company&#8217;s Optimized Publisher to help clients extract value from their social media content resulting in increased and sustained growth for companies.  Founded in 2009, SocialFlow is home to a world-class research team whose work has been featured in Reuters, the UK Guardian, Fast Company, Xinhua, the Huffington Post, MIT&#8217;s Technology Review, Nieman Journalism Lab, Business Insider, International Business Times, Salon and many others. SocialFlow is based in New York City and services a variety of clients, including the Economist, Pepsi, Forbes, Buzzfeed, New York Public Library and Human Rights
