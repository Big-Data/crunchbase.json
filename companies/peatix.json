The organizer can keep track of ticket sales 24/7, and on event day, attendees can be checked-in with scanner apps available for iOS and Android devices. </p>\n\n<p>PeaTiX launched in May 2011, and was originally developed by Orinoco K.K., the Tokyo-based marketing company that represents SurveyMonkey and bit.ly for Japan. The service was spun out as a U.S. company in December of the same year, with a new Japanese subsidiary, Orinoco Peatix K.K., acting as its sole licensee for the Japan market. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,144],"assets/images/resized/0017/3979/173979v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,241],"assets/images/resized/0017/3979/173979v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,434],"assets/images/resized/0017/3979/173979v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.62M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":615000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"500 Startups","permalink":"500-startups","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[417,272],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"DFJ JAIC","permalink":"dfj-jaic","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sunbridge Partners","permalink":"sunbridge-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0831/30831v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,126],"assets/images/resized/0003/0831/30831v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,226],"assets/images/resized/0003/0831/30831v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"ZenShin Capital","permalink":"zenshin-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0001/8868/18868v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/8868/18868v1-max-250x250.png"],[[380,67],"assets/images/resized/0001/8868/18868v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Taku","last_name":"Harada","permalink":"taku-harada-4","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Emi","last_name":"Takemura","permalink":"emi-takemura-2","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Akiko","last_name":"Fujikawa","permalink":"akiko-fujikawa","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/03/peatix-1-million/","source_description":"Seeking To Become The Eventbrite Of Japan, PeaTiX Raises $1 Million From 500 Startups And Others","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":2,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"DG Incubation","permalink":"dg-incubation","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":{"name":"Itochu Technology Ventures","permalink":"itochu-technology-ventures","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Goldberg","permalink":"dave-goldberg-3","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Taku","last_name":"Harada","permalink":"taku-harada-3","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Tats","last_name":"Saito","permalink":"tats-saito","image":null}},{"company":{"name":"Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati","permalink":"wilson-sonsini-goodrich-rosati","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"500 Startups","permalink":"500-startups","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[417,272],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://jp.techcrunch.com/archives/jp20111215peatix-goes-to-sv/","title":"PeaTiX goes to Silicon Valley"}]}
