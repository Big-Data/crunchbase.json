Jigsee applications run on a proprietary streaming platform, designed specifically to address network and handset deficiencies in developing countries.  </p>\n\n<p>Jigsee&#8217;s patent pending streaming technology allows for the delivery of continuous video and audio streams in dynamic, bandwidth-constrained environments.  While the Jigsee streaming platform provides support for advanced devices, Jigsee focused initially on the development of j2me applications in order to make the service operational on feature phones, which make up the vast majority (&gt;90%) of mobile devices in emerging markets.  </p>\n\n<p>The combination of low-bandwidth streaming capabilities and feature-phone support provide Jigsee with the ability to deliver streamed audio and video content to a larger audience than any other digital platform.</p>\n\n<p>After significant field testing of its prototype platform in Bangladesh and India, Jigsee chose India as its first market.  In early 2011, Jigsee raised its Series A round of financing from the Indian Angel Network and Sequoia capital with which Jigsee set up its Indian operations, and will soon be launching its service with several top-tier Indian content providers.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0014/3036/143036v8-max-150x150.png"],[[200,72],"assets/images/resized/0014/3036/143036v8-max-250x250.png"],[[200,72],"assets/images/resized/0014/3036/143036v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ray","last_name":"Newal","permalink":"ray-newal","image":{"available_sizes":[[[89,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/3055/143055v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[149,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/3055/143055v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[269,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/3055/143055v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Areef","last_name":"Reza","permalink":"areef-reza","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.marsdd.com/news-insights/newsreleases/jigsee07192010/","source_description":"Jigsee Secures Angel Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":1000,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.medianama.com/2011/03/223-video-streaming-co-jigsee-gets-series-a-funding-from-indian-angel-network/","source_description":"Video Streaming Co Jigsee Gets Series-A Funding From Indian Angel Network","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Indian Angel Network","permalink":"indian-angel-network","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0010/2285/102285v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[230,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/2285/102285v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[230,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/2285/102285v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Sequoia Capital","permalink":"sequoia-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6384/76384v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"India Head Office","address1":"#4, 1st Floor, Amardeep Building","address2":"396/11, 17th North Avenue Road","zip_code":"400054","city":"Santa Cruz (West), Mumbai","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Development Center","address1":"12 Ealing Street","address2":"","zip_code":"K2W 1E4","city":"Ottawa","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
