Weâ€™ve pioneered a new approach to interactivity called Conversation. Conversation allows machines to communicate more like people. Not in that AI robot sort of way. In a radio/television, written-by-writers, performed-by-actors sort of way.</p>\n\n<p>The Jellyvision Lab is a creative, focused, and driven company, with a strong vision for bringing interactive communication to the web for Fortune 500 partners in the healthcare, financial services, education and high-tech industries.
