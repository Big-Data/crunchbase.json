Third party casual, advanced casual and premium games are distributed in a device-independent format similar in concept to MP3 or PDF.  This format lets consumers access and share games from any of their connected Antix-powered &#8216;screens&#8217;, which include mobile phones, TVs, STBs, PMPs, and PCs. In much the same way as they do already with music, photos and videos, consumers can distribute trial games virally across networks and off-line to their friends and family while still protecting the rights and revenues of operators and publishers. In addition to AGP itself, Antix provides the corresponding tools, certification mechanism, optional white-label store, and optional game warehousing necessary to deploy a complete service offering.</p>\n\n<p>Antix Labs Ltd., headquartered in Reading, England was founded by Francis Charig, a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.
