We act as external hackers, picking through each access point on your website, trying to get in. If we are successful, we record where and how we did it, then report back to you!</p>\n\n<p>Our custom scanner combines the best (hand-picked, and hand stitched together) pieces of popular open source tools, along with other, custom tools built in-house (our &#8220;secret sauce&#8221;) to provide you with the best results. We provide precise vulnerability information, including specific input requests and vulnerability locations. Once you understand what you&#8217;re dealing with we will provide you with vulnerability fixes tailored toward your specific software stack.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/8108/138108v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0013/8108/138108v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0013/8108/138108v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ainsley","last_name":"Braun","permalink":"ainsley-braun","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Borohovski","permalink":"michael-borohovski","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Seed Investor","person":{"first_name":"Jai","last_name":"Choi","permalink":"jai-choi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/7093/87093v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[86,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/7093/87093v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[86,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/7093/87093v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jai","last_name":"Choi","permalink":"jai-choi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/7093/87093v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[86,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/7093/87093v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[86,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/7093/87093v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Tinfoil Security, Inc.","address1":"828 Bryant St","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
