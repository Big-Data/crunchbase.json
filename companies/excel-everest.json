All of the content is linked together with navigation buttons. There is a &#8220;Fun Button&#8221; which triggers the stars on the index screen to light up and a bear to dance across the screen. </p>\n\n<p>Excel Everest is available for Microsoft Excel 2003, 2007, and 2010 (Windows only) and is being sold for both individual and corporate use. Google was the first corporate user of Excel Everest. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0009/6275/96275v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,107],"assets/images/resized/0009/6275/96275v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[280,120],"assets/images/resized/0009/6275/96275v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Duffy","permalink":"sean-duffy-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6289/96289v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[164,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6289/96289v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[296,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/6289/96289v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Duffy","permalink":"sean-duffy-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nuhfSXdesoc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nuhfSXdesoc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Excel Everest Promotional Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0009/6274/96274v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0009/6274/96274v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,308],"assets/images/resized/0009/6274/96274v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://news.yahoo.com/excel-everest-mac-now-available-mac-users-finally-170210874.html","title":"Excel Everest training is now available for Mac"}]}
