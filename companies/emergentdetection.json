While completing their graduate studies at the University of Washington, the two met Dr. Aaron Falk, a PhD physicist with a specialization in optical systems, who developed the underlying technology for BodyKey. The companyâ€™s initial product, BodyKey, gives weight-loss seekers an immediate reading of how much fat they have burned from their diet and fitness efforts. This information provides a huge psychological boost for keeping people motivated since they can now see that they are, in fact, making progress towards their weight loss goals. Additionally, the accompanying computer software program is packed with useful tools that allow the user to track their daily progress, help them select foods and exercise programs that are ideal for their body, and provide them with accurate forecasting so they will know how long it will take them to reach their weight loss goal. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Fogel","permalink":"eric-fogel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Cheif Sales and Marketing Officer","person":{"first_name":"Keegan","last_name":"Hall","permalink":"keegan-hall-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$278k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://emergentdetection.com/pressmedia","source_description":"Emergent Detection Secures Seed Round of Funding from Angel Investors","raised_amount":48000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Unnamed","last_name":"angel investors","permalink":"unnamed-angel-investors","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://www.widepr.com/press_release/3176/Emergent_Detection_Awarded_229_900_Grant_For_Health_Product_BodyKey.html","source_description":"Emergent Detection Awarded $229,900 Grant For Health Product, BodyKey","raised_amount":229900,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"US Government","permalink":"us-government","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.widepr.com/press_release/3176/Emergent_Detection_Awarded_229_900_Grant_For_Health_Product_BodyKey.html","title":"Emergent Detection Awarded $229,900 Grant For Health Product, BodyKey"},{"external_url":"http://www.youngupstarts.com/2010/10/19/emergent-detection%E2%80%99s-bodykey-aids-your-fight-against-flab/","title":"Emergent Detectionâ€™s BodyKey Aids Your Fight Against Flab"},{"external_url":"http://www.youngmoney.com/entrepreneur/entrepreneur-profile-keegan-hall-and-emergent-detection/","title":"Entrepreneur Profile: Keegan Hall and Emergent Detection"}]}
