When people check-in to Modo at the store, they get instant access to offers, promotions, and deals from a wide variety of sources. When they checkout using Modo, everyone in the offer/deal value chain gets immediate verification and payment for the transaction. Plus, the consumer can use any card they want to fund their part of the purchase. The purchase information for payments using Modo improves the value of the next set of offers on both sides of the equation.</p>\n\n<p>Key takeaways about Modo are the frictionless adoption with no special infrastructure requirements, the ease of use for merchants, brands, and consumers, and finally how transaction data creates useful information for all parties. Modo closes the loop on the promotion, purchase, payment cycle. </p>\n\n<p>Tagline: Pay with Modo.
