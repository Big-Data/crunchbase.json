A physics sandbox game, Souptoys replicates a child&#8217;s wooden toy box full of toys, with an open-play environment encouraging creativity &amp; imagination. </p>\n\n<p>Playing on your desktop, Souptoys turns your computer desktop into a virtual playroom, with over 100 toys including basketballs, robots, wooden blocks, dinosaurs and a xylophone.</p>\n\n<p>Designed with players aged 5 to 12 in mind, the toys have an intuitive and tactile feel, using a mouse or touchpad, and the easy to pick up and play style allows kids to be enjoying themselves within seconds. Busy parents can play together with younger children who may be too young to use a mouse but are delighted to see a stuntman flying through a basketball hoop. </p>\n\n<p>Souptoys is free to download at souptoys.com, where players can also upload their creations to share with others. This growing community known as SoupWorld is a fun and secure place for kids to share and discuss their toys and ideas with other fans, with over 20,000 playsets shared to date.</p>\n\n<p>Souptoys makes the largest collection of desktop toys for PC.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0007/1944/71944v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0007/1944/71944v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0007/1944/71944v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Architect","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Hollingsworth","permalink":"tim-hollingsworth","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Designer","person":{"first_name":"Rory","last_name":"Schmitz","permalink":"rory-schmitz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Artist","person":{"first_name":"Khrob","last_name":"Edmonds","permalink":"khrob-edmonds","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Webkinz","permalink":"webkinz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/4048/4048v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,129],"assets/images/resized/0000/4048/4048v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,129],"assets/images/resized/0000/4048/4048v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Club Penguin","permalink":"clubpenguin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[63,67],"assets/images/resized/0000/3967/3967v25-max-150x150.jpg"],[[63,67],"assets/images/resized/0000/3967/3967v25-max-250x250.jpg"],[[63,67],"assets/images/resized/0000/3967/3967v25-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0007/1943/71943v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0007/1943/71943v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0007/1943/71943v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://download.cnet.com/Souptoys/3000-18529_4-10551080.html","title":"CNET review"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACg8Tiq76L0","title":"Souptoys video"},{"external_url":"http://lifehacker.com/5514594/souptoys-is-endless-desktop-fun-for-your-child-may-decrease-your-productivity","title":"Lifehacker review April 2010"}]}
