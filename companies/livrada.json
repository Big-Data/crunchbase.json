For centuries, people have given books to each other. Books are the perfect gift; meaningful and personal, a book reflects the thought that the gift-giver put into the purchase.</p>\n\n<p>We created Livrada title-based e-book gift cards (US Patent pending) to recapture this experience. We want to reintroduce a personal touch into the world of digital media, starting with e-books.</p>\n\n<p>What is a Livrada e-book card?</p>\n\n<p>A Livrada e-book card is a (physical) gift card, sold at retail, that represents a specific e-book title (e.g., The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ). Each card is beautifully designed with the book cover art and also includes a description, much like a traditional book jacket. The card allows the holder to redeem and download the specific e-book onto their e-reader device. At launch, this includes all Kindle and NOOK devices. The plan is to expand to other e-readers soon.</p>\n\n<p>The Company</p>\n\n<p>Livrada, Inc., based in Southern California, was formed in January 2012 by an experienced team of entrepreneurs with deep business and technology backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>Our team consists of experienced executives from the digital media, wireless, pre-paid, payments, and e-commerce industries. We’ve spent time at world-class companies like Virgin Mobile USA, Warner Music Group, McKinsey &amp; Co., Deloitte, and Lexis-Nexis, as well as a number of scrappy start-ups.</p>\n\n<p>We are lovers of technology who happen to believe that the off-line “real world” offers experiences that cannot be replicated in digital. We think Livrada e-book gift cards are a great way to start.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0021/2380/212380v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0021/2380/212380v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,124],"assets/images/resized/0021/2380/212380v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Kang","permalink":"richard-kang-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0013/2791/132791v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0013/2791/132791v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,399],"assets/images/resized/0013/2791/132791v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0021/2381/212381v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0021/2381/212381v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,294],"assets/images/resized/0021/2381/212381v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://paidcontent.org/2012/07/12/startup-livrada-to-sell-ebook-gift-cards-in-u-s-target-stores/","title":"paidContent article"},{"external_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/Livrada/ebook/prweb9693285.htm","title":"Press Release"},{"external_url":"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/53710-livrada-tries-its-luck-with-e-book-gift-cards.html","title":"Publishers Weekly article"},{"external_url":"http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/21/livrada-bridges-the-gap-between-physical-books-and-the-digital-world/","title":"pandodaily article"},{"external_url":"http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/ebook-startup-livrada-could-save-the-brick-and-mortars/","title":"Good E Reader article"}]}
