Using FiftyOne, U.S. retailers can rapidly develop their global ecommerce business across all dimensions, with FiftyOne managing all aspects of the international order lifecycle, including multi-currency pricing and payment processing, landed-cost calculation, customs clearance and brokerage, global logistics orchestration, international fraud management, and customer-experience parity.</p>\n\n<p>The company first came to market as E4X when it introduced a patented technology that allowed ecommerce retailers to automatically present and settle transactions in the preferred currencies of its international visitors. A key benefit of this was that it shielded retailers and consumers transacting in different countries from the volatility of foreign exchange rates. As the business matured however, it became clear that impediments to cross border commerce went way beyond currency to include payment, logistical, and cultural dimensions. In response, the company set about developing a complete, turnkey solution that allowed retailers selling online to quickly and easily sell internationally. FiftyOne today is recognized as the most comprehensive global e-commerce offering available in the marketplace. The company is powering the international expansion initiatives of many leading brands including Gilt Groupe, J.Crew, Macy&#8217;s, Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Overstock.com, Nordstrom, Gap, Neiman Marcus, JCPenney.</p>\n\n<p>FiftyOne is headquartered in New York City with research, development, and back office facilities in Tel Aviv, Israel, as well as satellite offices in Toronto, Canada and Shanghai, China.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0011/7736/117736v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,53],"assets/images/resized/0011/7736/117736v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,53],"assets/images/resized/0011/7736/117736v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"FiftyOne
