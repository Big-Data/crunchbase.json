By matching demand with supply we allow to make use of this spare capacity, thus helping transport providers to generate extra profits as well as customers to benefit from huge price discounts.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, Spedingo contributes day by day to the reduction of the number of vehicles on the roads, thus avoiding the associated CO2 emissions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0021/5932/215932v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,129],"assets/images/resized/0021/5932/215932v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,233],"assets/images/resized/0021/5932/215932v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief technology officer","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Tamanti","permalink":"marco-tamanti","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Tontini","permalink":"marco-tontini","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0021/4070/214070v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0021/4070/214070v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,356],"assets/images/resized/0021/4070/214070v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"uShip","permalink":"uship","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ANYVAN.com","permalink":"anyvan-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/3590/173590v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/3590/173590v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,194],"assets/images/resized/0017/3590/173590v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Milan","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
