For 25 years, GRAPHISOFT has been empowering the broadest community of architects to deliver model based projects that are better designed, more predictable to construct and less expensive to operate.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2007 GRAPHISOFT has been part of the Nemetschek Group.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT is firmly established in the world&#8217;s three largest AEC markets: the United States, Germany and Japan; yet approximately one-half of its revenues come from smaller markets often neglected by other companies.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT&#8217;s global experience and presence carry an even deeper strategic value as the world&#8217;s building and software markets transcend national boundaries. Whereas most of GRAPHISOFT&#8217;s competitors have relied historically on their domestic markets and tailored their products to domestic architectural standards and market priorities, GRAPHISOFT has quickly learned to identify and respect market differences. In the rapidly evolving world economy, companies such as GRAPHISOFT are ideally poised to exploit opportunities in local markets around the globe.\nClose alliance with local partners</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT relies on its network of independent distributors to meet current and future business goals. Their trust and investment allow GRAPHISOFT to focus on product quality, and their efforts in establishing solid markets for GRAPHISOFT products throughout the world are the cornerstone of the company&#8217;s success.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT works with dedicated distributors in 80 countries and hundreds of Value-Added Resellers (VARs) and Systems Integrators who ensure that customers receive support and personal attention wherever they are.</p>\n\n<p>A Multinational Software Corporation</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT SE, Budapest, Hungary is the largest entity in the GRAPHISOFT Group and the corporate headquarters. Its staff controls R&amp;D, manufacturing, publishing, and international sales and marketing. Approximately one half of the headquarters&#8217; staff is employed in product development, while additional teams assist international distributors in 14 geographic regions worldwide; localize and publish software and manuals in major languages; coordinate GRAPHISOFT&#8217;s Productivity Tools program; provide product support; and exercise financial control and steer the direction of the entire group.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT Deutschland GmbH, Munich, Germany was founded in 1988 to serve Europe&#8217;s largest CAD market. Traditionally, this office has contributed the most income among the subsidiary offices.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT N.A. Inc., Boston, following the merger of GRAPHISOFT US, Inc. San Francisco, established in 1989, with Drawbase software, the US division has moved to the Drawbase headquarters in Boston to market, sell and support Archicad in the United States and Canada. In addition, the U.S. office channels industry news, market information and user feedback from the world&#8217;s most computerized market.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT Japan Co. Ltd. opened in Tokyo in 1994 to serve the second largest architectural CAD market in the world. GRAPHISOFT&#8217;s adoption of Japanese architectural conventions and the development of strategic alliances with some of Japan&#8217;s largest construction companies and CAD software distributors resulted in rapid success in Japan.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT UK Ltd. was founded in 1997 to reinforce GRAPHISOFT&#8217;s commitment to the second largest architectural CAD market in Europe. The Woking office provides immediate marketing and technical assistance to the UK sales channel.</p>\n\n<p>ArchiCAD EspaÃ±a, S.A. was established in 1997 in Madrid. In addition to providing marketing and technical assistance to the local sales channel, the Madrid office provides sales and marketing support for Spanish-speaking Central and South American markets.</p>\n\n<p>GRAPHISOFT&#8217;s â€žbiggest not-so-secret weapon is its staff of developers [who] focus enormous talent on a niche, which Westerners can&#8217;t match.â€\nJonathan B.
