It&#8217;s like Kickstarter for dreams. Every person can realize his material dreams by sharing it with the whole world and doing different tasks. He pays $5/month and create his own dreams(up to 3).\nEvery month top rated dreams are sponsored by the company. It&#8217;s necessary to notice that winners receives their wishes that they placed on Dreamise. We don&#8217;t give a money. We makes your dreams come true!\nIdea is that more people participate, more people get their wishes. Dreamise just take the commission from every user and a part of Dreamise&#8217;s revenue going to charity program. Person’s dreams have their own ratings, which include votes &amp; comments for them and profile activity rating. Last one depends on his activity, means that more a person vote&amp;comment for smb else dreams,\nmore rating points he get to his dreams. Adding a person can perform different tasks and\nquests to raise up his rating. So, it becomes a some kind of a game where people gain\nreal things for himself or somebody.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0021/9598/219598v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0021/9598/219598v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0021/9598/219598v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO&Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nikolay","last_name":"Ponomarenko","permalink":"nikolay-ponomarenko-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0021/5822/215822v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,220],"assets/images/resized/0021/5822/215822v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,396],"assets/images/resized/0021/5822/215822v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP","person":{"first_name":"Vlad","last_name":"Novikov","permalink":"vlad-novikov-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/xBbeOplVYGI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/xBbeOplVYGI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>How to realize a dream?</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/8470/218470v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/8470/218470v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[321,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/8470/218470v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
