Maluuba’s proprietary, patent-pending engine provides superior capabilities to traditional voice recognition systems. Asking a question like, “what movies are playing nearby?” enables users to buy tickets, find theater directions, and share search results on social platform­s such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>The Maluuba language engine is a product of two years of advanced research in artificial intelligence, machine learning and linguistics. Maluuba received $2 million from Samsung Ventures in early 2012 and is planning to raise further investment later this year to expand into new domains of search, and other devices and platforms beyond the Android smart phone.</p>\n\n<p>With a goal of providing users the most appropriate answers to their entertainment, organizational and communication needs, Maluuba&#8217;s find it engine positions itself at the forefront of the mobile Internet search revolution.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0021/1112/211112v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0021/1112/211112v2-max-250x250.png"],[[280,90],"assets/images/resized/0021/1112/211112v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Pantony","permalink":"joshua-pantony","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"Pasupalak","permalink":"sam-pasupalak","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and VP Engineering","person":{"first_name":"G","last_name":"Wu","permalink":"g-wu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and Principal Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Kaheer","last_name":"Suleman","permalink":"kaheer-suleman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Infrastructure Services Lead","person":{"first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"Petrescu","permalink":"adrian-petrescu","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"Musbah","permalink":"mohamed-musbah","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Siri","permalink":"siri","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0002/6643/26643v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,181],"assets/images/resized/0002/6643/26643v5-max-250x250.png"],[[278,202],"assets/images/resized/0002/6643/26643v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":29,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Samsung Ventures","permalink":"samsung-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/2039/32039v1-max-150x150.png"],[[129,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/2039/32039v1-max-250x250.png"],[[129,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/2039/32039v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Suite 324, 121 Charles Street West, The Tannery","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Kitchener","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style='text-align:center'>\r\n<object width='430' height='272' id='FiveminPlayer' classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000'>\r\n<param name='allowfullscreen' value='true'/>\r\n<param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always'/>\r\n<param name='movie' value='http://embed.5min.com/517476455/'/>\r\n<param name='wmode' value='opaque' />\r\n<embed name='FiveminPlayer' src='http://embed.5min.com/517476455/' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='430' height='272' allowfullscreen='true' allowScriptAccess='always' wmode='opaque'>\r\n</embed>\r\n</object>\r\n<br/>\r\n</div>","description":"<p>Maluuba Demo TechCrunch Disrupt 2012</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
