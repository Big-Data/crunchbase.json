Differently than with competitor <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/digg\" title=\"Digg\">Digg</a>, Spotplex users are not required to change their behavior to generate content rankings. By eliminating tagging and voting, Spotplex more accurately reflects what people read most today.  Digg and many other social news sites do a reasonable to good job of displaying the most popular news articles of the day, but what they do best is uncover the most interesting content rather than the most read.An algorithm-based measuring system analyzes readers&#8217; behavior in real time to generate Spotplex&#8217;s popular content rankings.  Popular content is derived by aggregating the most read articles on sites that include Spotplex&#8217;s javascript (copies of this code is available to the public).  This impartial process gives every blogger a fair opportunity to be heard. Spotplex also uses a relative popularity measure by which article reads are measured relative to a site&#8217;s overall traffic, rather than by volume alone. This evens the playing field so all blogs can compete equally in the Spotplex rankings, regardless of readership size or subject matter.
