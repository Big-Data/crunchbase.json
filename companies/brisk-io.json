Now they can be made with Brisk. </p>\n\n<p>Brisk was born out of necessity. We were developing an interactive television app for one of Europe&#8217;s largest telecom providers, that had to run on a slow television box and work seamlessly with other devices (phone, smart-TV, tablet, desktop). There weren&#8217;t any tools out there that could do that, so we made our own. This became the technological core of our product and gave us a ton of ideas to use Brisk in even more innovative projects.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"de Beer","permalink":"jim-de-beer","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Ramon","last_name":"Duivenvoorden","permalink":"ramon-duivenvoorden","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"Tauber","permalink":"alejandro-tauber","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"Besjes","permalink":"marcus-besjes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Niels","last_name":"van de Loo","permalink":"niels-van-de-loo","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Meteor","permalink":"meteor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0020/2901/202901v1-max-150x150.png"],[[176,127],"assets/images/resized/0020/2901/202901v1-max-250x250.png"],[[176,127],"assets/images/resized/0020/2901/202901v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Mojito","permalink":"mojito","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Umspannwerk","address1":"Ohlauer Stra√üe 43","address2":"","zip_code":"10999","city":"Berlin","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
