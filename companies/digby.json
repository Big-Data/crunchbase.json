In our current omni-channel market, consumers experience a brand, not a channel within a brand. Digby helps brands connect with consumers across all channels, driving store traffic, engaging with consumers in the store, enabling mobile commerce, and providing web-style analytics to the physical retail store.</p>\n\n<p>Through the Digby Localpoint™ Mobile Platform, comprised of Analytics, Outreach, Venue, and Storefront, Digby leverages location-based technology to allow brands to push effective, targeted location-aware messages and attract, influence, and own the relationship with their customers across all channels – all through their own branded mobile experience.</p>\n\n<p>Solely focused on the retail channel since 2006, Digby has more than 50 top retailers already enabled including Cabela&#8217;s, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, RadioShack, HP, Hasbro, Orvis, and maurices.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0003/7210/37210v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0003/7210/37210v4-max-250x250.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0003/7210/37210v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Digby
