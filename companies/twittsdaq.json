What the site does is to look at the number of followers that a person has, and when that number is greater than the number of people who he is following then it is said that the person has a positive influence. Well, the site does something more than merely â€œsayâ€ that the influence is positive based on that. It actually calculates the difference between the two arithmetically, and the result of such an operation is expressed in TwittsDaq Dollars. </p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, we could say that each follower is worth more or less T$0.01. The exact equation for arriving at the final figure is this: ((&#8220;Number of Followers&#8221; and the &#8220;Number of Following&#8221;) plus (List times 10)) divided by 100. </p>\n\n<p>In this way, Twitter becomes something akin to a marketplace, and people compete to be the top influencer (EG, the richest individuals in the twitterverse). And such a game is given a further twist by letting players actually buy influence, and also participating in the daily challenges that are featured on the main page of the site.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[48,48],"assets/images/resized/0009/3993/93993v2-max-150x150.png"],[[48,48],"assets/images/resized/0009/3993/93993v2-max-250x250.png"],[[48,48],"assets/images/resized/0009/3993/93993v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"TwitterCounter","permalink":"twittercounter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0002/3681/23681v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[230,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/3681/23681v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[230,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/3681/23681v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0009/3992/93992v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,103],"assets/images/resized/0009/3992/93992v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,185],"assets/images/resized/0009/3992/93992v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/twittsdaq-com-turning-twitter-into-a-financial-game","title":"TwittsDaq.com - Turning Twitter Into A Financial Game"},{"external_url":"http://www.feedmyapp.com/p/a/twittsdaq-spread-your-influence/17672","title":"Twittsdaq: Spread your Influence"},{"external_url":"http://www.ziipa.com/view/twittsdaq-com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/beta/twittsdaq","title":""}]}
