Our application allows loyal customers, just like you, to win great prizes by interacting with their favorite brands. Win by taking the most creative photo, getting the most votes from your friends and countless other ways depending on the contest you entered. Our contests allow small business owners and Fortune 500 executives alike to leverage the creative juices of their awesome customers in order to create the optimal marketing campaign for their business or promotion.</p>\n\n<p>The Daily Hundred offers a very different approach to online social media advertising. Unlike ‘daily deal’ sites, The Daily Hundred doesn’t inherently appeal to the deal-seeker clientele. Rather than drive customers who statistically don’t tip and don’t return for more business, The Daily Hundred revives the notion that well-placed advertising and product awareness will drive genuine customers who previously lacked either brand or  promotion awareness for your business.</p>\n\n<p>I just won a Daily Hundred contest, so what is my prize? Let’s just say, when you win a Daily Hundred contest you don’t get a virtual badge or a 5% discount on your next purchase. The incentive for you… $100 cash or more!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0021/4137/214137v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0021/4137/214137v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,91],"assets/images/resized/0021/4137/214137v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and COO","person":{"first_name":"Maxwell","last_name":"Finn","permalink":"maxwell-finn-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Vahid","last_name":"Salami","permalink":"vahid-salami","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Haase","permalink":"nick-haase","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Dugosh","permalink":"chris-dugosh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of User Development","person":{"first_name":"Doug","last_name":"Rios","permalink":"doug-rios","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Ledden","permalink":"chris-ledden","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Groupon","permalink":"groupon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-150x150.png"],[[231,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-250x250.png"],[[231,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kiip","permalink":"kiip","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5908/95908v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5908/95908v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/5908/95908v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"foursquare","permalink":"foursquare","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-250x250.png"],[[442,122],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Pictorious","permalink":"pictorious","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/8083/188083v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/8083/188083v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/8083/188083v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$100k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"Finn","permalink":"jeffrey-finn","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"201 SE 2nd Ave Suite #209","address2":"","zip_code":"32601","city":"Gainesville","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4133/214133v2-max-150x150.png"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4133/214133v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4133/214133v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4134/214134v2-max-150x150.png"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4134/214134v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4134/214134v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4135/214135v2-max-150x150.png"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4135/214135v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4135/214135v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4136/214136v2-max-150x150.png"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4136/214136v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4136/214136v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sg.ufl.edu/News/tabid/126/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/118/Default","title":"University of Florida Article About Daily Hundred"},{"external_url":"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/mobile-weekly-wrap-googles-gift-and-patent-infringements/","title":"App of the Week"},{"external_url":"http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/08/todays-best-apps-mealmonkey-evertale-pocket-games-and-more","title":"Today's Best Apps: MealMonkey, Evertale, Pocket Games And More"}]}
