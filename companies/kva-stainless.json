With its new technology, KVA says martensitic steel has strength, hardness, and durability greater than titanium, and can be manufactured at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n\n<p>Samples of a Ford F150 tow hook were manufactured using KVAâ€™s technology. The new tow hook weighed 50% less and was 17% stronger.  Danny Codd, chief engineer at KVA Stainless, explained that high strength structural shapes can now be integrated into high performance structural assemblies to reduce weight, increase strength and stiffness. Codd outlined a number of components such as vehicle frames, support structures, chassis cross members, bumper beams, suspension control arms, sub-frames, side impact beams, roof rails, etc. could be manufactured using KVAâ€™s technology. Douglas Gore, vice-president of sales, says, â€œThe automotive industry is a perfect fit for our technology. We can increase the strength of the structure to protect the riders, while reducing the overall weight of the vehicle, which results in increased gas mileage.â€ </p>\n\n<p>KVAâ€™s patented processes allows martensitic steel to be welded and or heat-treated into the desired form without losing strength or becoming brittle.</p>\n\n<p>Martensitic stainless steel, containing iron, chromium, and carbon, have been around for decades. Its molecular structure, composed of irregularly shaped crystals, makes it very hard and strong. </p>\n\n<p>Welding martensitic steel can alter its crystalline structure, causing it to become brittle around the weld. So it&#8217;s often used in one-piece products like cutlery.</p>\n\n<p>KVA&#8217;s patented technology controls the welding process to rapidly make welds without this brittleness, says Codd. This opens up martensitic steel to markets previously thought impractical such as lightweight automotive components &amp; structures, gas &amp; oil production/pipelines, aviation components &amp; structures, medical devices, bike frames, golf shafts, lacrosse sticks, heat exchangers, bridge structures, dairy, petrochemical &amp; processing equipment, solar water heaters, train/rail cars, etc..</p>\n\n<p>KVA is presently selling its new lightweight, high strength tubing into the bicycle market.</p>\n\n<p>Technology roots</p>\n\n<p>The founder of KVA Stainless, Ed McCrink, along with the scientific team has over 60 years combined experience in thermal processing, metallurgy, automated welding, brazing and mechanical design. McCrink is accomplished in the world of stainless steel for his business and technological innovations.</p>\n\n<p>KVA was founded several years ago by McCrink and is becoming a leader in stainless steel research and development.  McCrink has continuously pursued his vision of utilizing commonly available, low cost martensitic stainless steels to reduce weight and increase strength in components and structures. </p>\n\n<p>McCrink began his career in 1954 in Chicago, where he founded Hi-Temp, which became one of the largest thermal processors specializing in bright annealing, brazing, and heat treating of stainless steels.  Other companies he founded were Tru-Temp, which specialized in hardening and stress relieving of all types of stainless including plain steel forgings, castings and metal stampings.  Steel Treating Inc. became a plant where an enormous volume of annealing and bright hardening was done.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/3313/103313v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0010/3313/103313v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0010/3313/103313v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Ed","last_name":"McCrink","permalink":"ed-mccrink","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Codd","permalink":"danny-codd","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Douglas","last_name":"Gore","permalink":"douglas-gore","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Laurie","last_name":"McCrink","permalink":"laurie-mccrink","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"McCrink","permalink":"joe-mccrink","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corp.
