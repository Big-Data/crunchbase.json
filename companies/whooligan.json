The Whooligan.com site is an interconnected network of forums, videos, photos, and special brand content. The company uses the site as a marketing vehicle for the brand to sell merchandise offline. They call their online/offline approach the Web 2.0Â². The site was launched in public beta in December 2008. </p>\n\n<p>Whooligan was started by two brothers dedicated to providing soccer fans from every walk of life a chance to support their side against rivals. Whooligan users will be able to build their own brand, effectively turning the traditional roles of the producer and consumer in the marketplace upside down. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/4079/24079v13-max-150x150.png"],[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/4079/24079v13-max-250x250.png"],[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/4079/24079v13-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Kane","permalink":"matthew-kane","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
