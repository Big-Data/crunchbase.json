Unless users build the system from the ground up, there is no way for them to create their own niche marketplaces.  Before now, users had to be technologically savvy enough to program their own ecommerce marketplace in order to get started.  But not anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Thatâ€™s where Marketplacr comes in.  Marketplacr is the Tumblr of online marketplaces.  Users enter their basic info, customize their niche marketplace, and take it live.  They invite their friends through social networking integration, and begin building their community.</p>\n\n<p>Marketplacr empowers out users by providing them with two essential functions: marketplace creation and site management.</p>\n\n<p>Marketplacr allows creators to make their own niche marketplace in under 5 minutes simply by entering basic information, picking a predesigned theme, and inviting friends to join through email, Google+, and Facebook integration.</p>\n\n<p>The marketplace creator gets a percentage of all transactions that occur on the site.  This percentage is adjustable by the creator.</p>\n\n<p>Sample uses include textbook marketplaces at universities, painting/glassblowing/ceramics/sculpture marketplaces in growing art communities, designer jean sales in collaboration with online forums, and a lot more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0015/1284/151284v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0015/1284/151284v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,63],"assets/images/resized/0015/1284/151284v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Cinnamon","permalink":"ian-cinnamon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0426/120426v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/0426/120426v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[193,275],"assets/images/resized/0012/0426/120426v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/28335319?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/3153/153153v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0015/3153/153153v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,336],"assets/images/resized/0015/3153/153153v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
