By combining smartphones with a mobile base, we create robots that do awesome things (telepresence, autonomous navigation, machine vision). </p>\n\n<p>Our first product, Romo, is an iDevice-powered robot that lets you video chat with anyone, anywhere in the world. You can customize Romo’s behavior through a graphical programming interface that’s n00b-friendly. Teaching our bot new behaviors is easy - just update the app. </p>\n\n<p>Our investors believe we’ll change the world by putting a robot in every home in America. We’re well funded by SV Angel/Ron Conway, Mike Arrington, Chris Dixon, and Stanford University. Last summer we started in TechStars Seattle. By Christmas we were shipping handbuilt Romos to 33 countries. </p>\n\n<p>We’re a tight tribe. We design our hardware and software in The Ogden, an apartment building in downtown Las Vegas where most of us live and work. When we aren’t coding, soldering, or checking production lines at our factory in China, we’re probably playing Starcraft or rock climbing at the local gym.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is simple: build awesome robots that make normal peoples’ lives better. If this sounds totally f@$king awesome, Romotive is the place for you.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/7289/157289v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/7289/157289v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/7289/157289v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Romo, the Smartphone Robot","permalink":"romo-the-smartphone-robot","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Keller","last_name":"Rinaudo","permalink":"keller-rinaudo","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Phu","last_name":"Nguyen","permalink":"phu-nguyen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Seid","permalink":"peter-seid","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Jen","last_name":"McCabe","permalink":"jen-mccabe-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Roboticist","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Solocheck","permalink":"aaron-solocheck","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Keller","last_name":"Rinaudo","permalink":"keller-rinaudo-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$6.5M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"http://news.cnet.com/8301-32973_3-57371451-296/romo-the-smartphone-robot-raises-$1.5m-seeks-world-domination/","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":10,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Hsieh","permalink":"tony-hsieh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0002/8084/28084v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0002/8084/28084v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0002/8084/28084v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Tisch","permalink":"david-tisch","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8909/98909v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8909/98909v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/8909/98909v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"PivotNorth Capital","permalink":"pivotnorth-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/8404/208404v2-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/8404/208404v2-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0020/8404/208404v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Lerer Ventures","permalink":"lerer-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,5],"assets/images/resized/0008/9468/89468v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,9],"assets/images/resized/0008/9468/89468v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,16],"assets/images/resized/0008/9468/89468v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Stanford University Venture Fund","permalink":"stanford-university-venture-fund","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"David G.","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"david-cohen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9993/29993v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/9993/29993v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[341,396],"assets/images/resized/0002/9993/29993v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David G.
