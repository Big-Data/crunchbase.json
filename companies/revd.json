Frustrated by longstanding inefficiency in the entertainment industry as well as artificial limitations on how fans and talent interact, Revd was motivated to create a platform to inspire a groundbreaking shift in how fans support and interact with up-and-coming, established and celebrity talent.  </p>\n\n<p>The online world is increasingly more social, providing broader exposure to information. However, fans still have limited ability to convert this increased social access into elevating their talent of choice, or for creating the talent focused events they want to experience. Similarly, talentâ€™s social resources generate exposure, but with limited tools for career growth and/or monetization of their brand.  </p>\n\n<p>The Revd platform efficiently creates and fosters tighter, more direct relationships among the global community of fans and talent (and industry) while streamlining the path to establishing valuable opportunities. Fans now have one centralized online hub for following, engaging and supporting celebrities and other talent, combined with a unique ability to crowd-source opportunities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/3219/183219v7-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/3219/183219v7-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0018/3219/183219v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0018/2036/182036v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0018/2036/182036v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,269],"assets/images/resized/0018/2036/182036v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
