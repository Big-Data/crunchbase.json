All Grupthink plans allow unlimited members and total custom branding. Grupthink is a hosted web service, starting at  $25/mo with a 30-day free trial. </p>\n\n<p>How is Grupthink different? In a nutshell, Grupthink is about making feedback useful and fun. Grupthink was designed to work either as an integrated piece of an existing online community, or as a standalone web property, making it unique among feedback community solutions. The platform has comprehensive community and content management tools built-in,  uses a unique voting system involving instant run-off (ranked votes) and allows &#8220;time traveling&#8221; to see how results change over time in a single discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Grupthink started as a for-fun community in 2006 at grupthink.com. (Grupthink.com continues to run as a &#8220;free-for-all&#8221; community.) Since 2007, the Grupthink-powered platform has been used to power branded online communities, internal knowledge sharing groups, and private online focus groups for client organizations. In September 2009, the platform became available to everyone at at grupthinkpowered.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0005/9964/59964v2-max-150x150.png"],[[214,58],"assets/images/resized/0005/9964/59964v2-max-250x250.png"],[[214,58],"assets/images/resized/0005/9964/59964v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Sundheim","permalink":"steven-sundheim","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Masterson","permalink":"john-masterson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Loucks","permalink":"brian-loucks","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Get Satisfaction","permalink":"satisfaction","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0000/0766/766v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/0766/766v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,104],"assets/images/resized/0000/0766/766v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"UserVoice","permalink":"uservoice","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/7497/17497v14-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/7497/17497v14-max-250x250.png"],[[450,112],"assets/images/resized/0001/7497/17497v14-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"IdeaScale","permalink":"ideascale-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0008/7939/87939v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/7939/87939v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,132],"assets/images/resized/0008/7939/87939v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Missoula","address1":"110 Caras Dr","address2":"","zip_code":"59801","city":"Missoula","state_code":"MT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0005/9963/59963v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,201],"assets/images/resized/0005/9963/59963v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,363],"assets/images/resized/0005/9963/59963v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
