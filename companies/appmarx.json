APPMARX is structured as a social network, and used by site owners to &#8220;network&#8221; with contextual sites.  The APPMARX service is visible with participating site using a special recommendation widget.</p>\n\n<p>Key attributes of APPMARX Site Networking:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Oragnic: APPMARX provides contextual recommendations to users visiting a site. APPMARX is not a destination site. APPMARX is a network curated by site owners.</p></li>\n<li><p>Human Curated Context: APPMARX is not using algorithms to produce context. It is deriving context from relationships between its participating sites. Overtime, relationships are curated by site owners based on what has been working best for their users.  For that APPMARX provides extensive statistical information of traffic behavior.</p></li>\n<li><p>Social Mechanics: APPMARX leverages social mechanics to produce scalable site to site network. Site owners simply network with each other to produce connections that result with on-site recommendations.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We believe that recommendations driven by site owners creates a fantastic contextual discovery graph for users. We call it &#8216;Site Networking&#8217; because it&#8217;s where site owners &#8220;network&#8221; in a new, meaningful way.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0041/120041v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/0041/120041v2-max-250x250.png"],[[302,302],"assets/images/resized/0012/0041/120041v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tzachi","last_name":"Ben Ayoun","permalink":"tzachi-ben-ayoun-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, CTO","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Ben Ayoun","permalink":"adam-ben-ayoun","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Google","permalink":"google","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-250x250.png"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0002/9578/29578v31-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0012/0040/120040v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,159],"assets/images/resized/0012/0040/120040v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,286],"assets/images/resized/0012/0040/120040v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
