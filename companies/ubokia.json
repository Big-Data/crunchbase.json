In a reversal of the traditional buy-sell model, members post what they want to buy on Ubokia, and sellers respond with offers.</p>\n\n<p>When a seller posts an item for sale on Ubokia, he or she instantly connects with qualified buyers. Conversely, when a buyer posts a “Want”, they can immediately view matching Seller Items.</p>\n\n<p>Members can also join specific Groups based on proximity or shared interests, enabling them to buy and sell within a secure, trusted network.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/8594/158594v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/8594/158594v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,60],"assets/images/resized/0015/8594/158594v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Pine","permalink":"mark-pine","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CMO","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Pine","permalink":"scott-pine","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Pine","permalink":"matt-pine","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Research & Development","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Stein","permalink":"bill-stein","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Business Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Petroni","permalink":"david-petroni","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"eBay","permalink":"ebay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Craigslist","permalink":"craigslist","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-150x150.png"],[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-250x250.png"],[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"2430 Camino Ramon","address2":"Ste. 120","zip_code":"94583","city":"San Ramon","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/28131000?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"440\" height=\"248\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/29066699?byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"440\" height=\"325\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":""}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/5623/165623v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[169,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/5623/165623v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[304,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/5623/165623v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0016/5624/165624v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,248],"assets/images/resized/0016/5624/165624v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,446],"assets/images/resized/0016/5624/165624v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0019/6050/196050v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0019/6050/196050v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,320],"assets/images/resized/0019/6050/196050v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
