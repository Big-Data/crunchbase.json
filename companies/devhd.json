Think MyYahoo meets Digg meets Wired. </p>\n\n<p>Streets is a more generic mash-up framework which tries to isolate and encapsulates things that are needed to build feedly but are not specific to feedly.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of a panel of 200 users, they have iterated seven times since the inception of the project.
