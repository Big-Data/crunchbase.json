During your swing, this chip samples the position and orientation of your club 1000 times per second - compare this to conventional video cameras which only record around 60 frames per second - and can wirelessly communicate the data to your phone. Your smart phone&#8217;s high powered processor then takes this data and completely reconstructs and analyzes your swing - all in less than a second. Once reconstructed, the swing is rendered and displayed in 3D on your screen, complete with annotated analysis.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0010/4287/104287v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0010/4287/104287v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,273],"assets/images/resized/0010/4287/104287v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
