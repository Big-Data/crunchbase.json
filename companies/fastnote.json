Fastnote is like &#8220;public email,&#8221; and reading Fastnotes is like reading someone&#8217;s public inbox.  </p>\n\n<p>Fastnote notifies celebrities, organizations, and &#8220;public&#8221; people as new notes are posted to them.   Also, 100% of the content on Fastnote is open to the public and indexed by search engines.  So if you post a note to someone, there&#8217;s a good chance that they will eventually see it.</p>\n\n<p>All Fastnotes must be civil and anonymous.  Obscenities, accusations, threats, spam, and personal information are not allowed.  </p>\n\n<p>Fastnote was created to give everyone a greater voice.  Many people are difficult or impossible to reach, and email addresses are often hard to find.   Fastnote was designed to give everyone a new way to tell others what they think &#8211; to speak their minds, to praise what&#8217;s good, and to change what isn&#8217;t.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0013/3066/133066v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0013/3066/133066v6-max-250x250.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0013/3066/133066v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Warren","last_name":"Hart","permalink":"warren-hart","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Shaffner","permalink":"richard-shaffner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Louis","last_name":"Shaffner","permalink":"louis-shaffner","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Twitter","permalink":"twitter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Website Development","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Ender Technology Corporation","permalink":"ender-technology-corporation","image":null}},{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Strait Insights, LLC","permalink":"strait-insights-llc","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$800k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":550000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":31,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"400 Crenshaw Blvd.","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"90503","city":"Torrance","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/12/28/1937936/no-names-just-rants-and-raves.html#storylink=misearch","title":"Early Press Coverage"},{"external_url":"http://civilination.org/?s=fastnote","title":"Coverage in Civilination.org"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztW3cpC79lI","title":"TV News about Fastnote "}]}
