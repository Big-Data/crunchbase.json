Plurk is similar to <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> in its basic functionality, except that each initial comment is given a thread of responses, making it more conversational in style.  Plurk asks users to select qualifiers such as loves, likes, is, hates, etc for each message.  This means every message you write is in third person.</p>\n\n<p>Like <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pownce\" title=\"Pownce\">Pownce</a>, Plurk lets you embed Flickr images and YouTube videos.  Plurk has added image hosting to the site to ease the posting of photos.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Plurk differs from <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> in its user interface.  Plurk shows your friends&#8217; updates in a horizontally scrolling timeline.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[81,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/9619/19619v1-max-150x150.png"],[[81,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/9619/19619v1-max-250x250.png"],[[81,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/9619/19619v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Plurk","permalink":"plurk","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director, Asia Pacific","person":{"first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Lin","permalink":"danny-lin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0014/9309/149309v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,173],"assets/images/resized/0014/9309/149309v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,173],"assets/images/resized/0014/9309/149309v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Danny Lin</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"FriendFeed","permalink":"friendfeed","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/1096/1096v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1096/1096v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1096/1096v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Twitter","permalink":"twitter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Edmodo","permalink":"edmodo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/6596/16596v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0001/6596/16596v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,196],"assets/images/resized/0001/6596/16596v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Lifeblob","permalink":"lifeblob","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/5933/25933v2-max-150x150.png"],[[131,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/5933/25933v2-max-250x250.png"],[[131,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/5933/25933v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"StatusNet","permalink":"statusnet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/1436/21436v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/1436/21436v7-max-250x250.png"],[[300,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/1436/21436v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"CitySpeek","permalink":"cityspeek","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0003/1711/31711v1-max-150x150.png"],[[204,49],"assets/images/resized/0003/1711/31711v1-max-250x250.png"],[[204,49],"assets/images/resized/0003/1711/31711v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Shoutitout","permalink":"shoutitout","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0007/6149/76149v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6149/76149v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/6149/76149v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"2425 Matheson Blvd","address2":"8th Floor, Suite 813","zip_code":"L4W 5K4","city":"Mississauga","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":43.657979,"longitude":-79.603622}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/plurk_unique_or_just_another_t.php","title":"Plurk: Unique or Just Another Twitter Clone?"},{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/06/pluck-twitter-meets-friendfeed/","title":"Plurk: Twitter meets FriendFeed"}]}
