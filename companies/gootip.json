Indeed, the siteâ€™s content presented to users depends on their location in order to improve relevance. This is made possible thanks to usersâ€™ ip location, information given by registered members, Foursquare and Facebook Graph.</p>\n\n<p>All registered users can respond to all questions. However, combining usersâ€™ location, information provided when they register, and their expertise level through â€œstickersâ€ won by precise actions, questions asked will be answered primarily by people living / working in the city or the specific location concerned.\nWe notified by email and through our mobile application, these skilled people in order they answer in priority.\nFor Â« live Â» questions requiring fast answers (only opened for 1 hour), we combine data presented above to recent Facebook and Foursquare usersâ€™ checkins. So we can notify our experts that questions are asked around their current location.\nOf course, users who ask questions are also notified by email and mobile â€œPushâ€ notification when an answer is given to one of their questions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0013/5386/135386v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,109],"assets/images/resized/0013/5386/135386v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,109],"assets/images/resized/0013/5386/135386v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mathieu","last_name":"Bidart","permalink":"mathieu-bidart","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Gagnaire","permalink":"eric-gagnaire-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Thierry","last_name":"Sebba","permalink":"thierry-sebba","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
