The site was made so it could be viewed in both English and Japanese.  </p>\n\n<p>In April of 2006 Zooomer was relaunched and the following month digital media enthusiast Thomas Hawk was hired on as Zooomr&#8217;s CEO.</p>\n\n<p>Zooomr has continued to grow since then and now supports 18 localizations.  For non English speakers, Zooomr may be the most compelling photo sharing option.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/2566/2566v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,100],"assets/images/resized/0000/2566/2566v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,100],"assets/images/resized/0000/2566/2566v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Zooomr","permalink":"zooomr","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
