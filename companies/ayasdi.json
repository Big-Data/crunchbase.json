We believe that our products will fundamentally alter the way complex data is analyzed.</p>\n\n<p>Our flagship product Iris quickly turns data into interactive visualizations that show the patterns hidden in the numbers and uncover actionable insights. In the same way medical professionals use MRI technology to image physical structures hidden from view, you can use Iris to find hidden structures in your data sets. Finding structure in complex data is the central challenge of the information age.</p>\n\n<p>We are a team of mathematicians, computer scientists and biologists, who came together to develop algorithms and software to address this challenge. Our unique technology leverages a ten years of Stanford research in computational topology. The patent pending software enables, for the ï¬rst time, an interactive analysis of data sets with millions of dimensions and data points. Since it only requires a measure of similarity in order to compare data points, the software can handle seemingly disparate data types such as text documents and networks in addition to the usual tabular data.</p>\n\n<p>The visualizations are beautiful and offer immediate insight into the relationships contained in the source data. They also preserve inherent geometric features in the data, permitting us to find patterns which are often difficult or impossible to discover by other means. Iris is also robust to outliers and missing data, interactively preventing visual artifacts from appearing that are not present in the data. Furthermore, the algorithms lend themselves naturally to parallelization, and scale from laptop to data center sized installations.</p>\n\n<p>We work with customers in life sciences and government. The problem spaces are as varied as disease diagnostics, fraud detection, materials discovery, failure analysis, text mining. Every data set analyzed by Iris has led to identification of previously undiscovered knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Topological analysis lets the shape of data guide the decision making process.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0014/7580/147580v2-max-150x150.png"],[[198,70],"assets/images/resized/0014/7580/147580v2-max-250x250.png"],[[198,70],"assets/images/resized/0014/7580/147580v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Gurjeet","last_name":"Singh","permalink":"gurjeet-singh","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"N","last_name":"Shivakumar","permalink":"n-shivakumar","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7324/147324v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[142,178],"assets/images/resized/0014/7324/147324v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[142,178],"assets/images/resized/0014/7324/147324v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"Miura-Ko","permalink":"ann-miura-ko","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/1439/81439v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/1439/81439v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[211,278],"assets/images/resized/0008/1439/81439v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"FLOODGATE","permalink":"floodgate","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0008/1508/81508v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,144],"assets/images/resized/0008/1508/81508v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[315,182],"assets/images/resized/0008/1508/81508v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
