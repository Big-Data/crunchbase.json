The engine is able to deduce and build dynamically &#8220;on the fly&#8221; graphical components, then programmer just have to declare the business concepts and business rules. Declarative systems let business logic be easy and low cost/time to evolve, overwrite and to share.</p>\n\n<p>Actually DynaGent system is comercialized in cloud and it runs in 5 companies wich size is near 5 million euro annual revenues.</p>\n\n<p>Business Models developed by DynaGent fit with small business. However higer companies should be natural target for Dynagent, because higer companies demands more adaptation. So in order to reach medium size companies, grow business models is needed.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0018/9669/189669v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0018/9669/189669v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[290,83],"assets/images/resized/0018/9669/189669v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Alfonso","last_name":"González","permalink":"alfonso-gonzlez","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/0573/190573v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[235,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/0573/190573v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[424,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/0573/190573v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Analista programador","person":{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"José Martinez","permalink":"francisco-jos-martinez","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Microsoft Dynamics","permalink":"microsoft-dynamics-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sage Software","permalink":"sage-software-2","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€950k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.cdti.es/index.asp?MP=7&MS=112&MN=4","source_description":"NEOTEC CDTI","raised_amount":350000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":13,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"15","last_name":"socios angel 156K€","permalink":"15-socios-angel-156k","image":null}},{"company":{"name":"CDTI (NEOTEC)","permalink":"cdti-neotec","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.enisa.es","source_description":"ENISA","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":11,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"ENISA (200K€)","permalink":"enisa-200k","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Socios","last_name":"angel (100K€)","permalink":"socios-angel-100k","image":null}}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.cdti.es/index.asp?MP=7&MS=20&MN=3","source_description":"CDTI PID","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"CDTI (224K€)","permalink":"cdti-224k","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Socios","last_name":"(76K€)","permalink":"socios-76k","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Dirección","address1":"Antonio Nebrija 51","address2":"","zip_code":"41930","city":"Bormujos","state_code":null,"country_code":"ESP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
