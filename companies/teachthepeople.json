The application lets anyone with specific subject knowledge or a useful skill set share it by setting up a Teach the People learning communities with 1gig of free storage. The learning communities provide educators and students with all the standard learning management system tools that are standard on existing systems (<a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/blackboard\" title=\"Blackboard\">Blackboard</a>, Moodle), and some not so standard like video chat and VOIP.</p>\n\n<p>The service leverages Facebook as a social network by providing tools to intelligently connect educators and learners. Once an educator sets up a learning community she can find other Teach the People users to invite through a list automatically generated based on user interests and the community description. Also, users interested in learning about a specific topic can crowdsource their requests for an expert through a Digg-like request tool. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Teach the People provides a flexible subscription platform so that educators can charge a variety of one time, monthly, and yearly fees to their community members. </p>\n\n<p>Teach the People&#8217;s business model is to charge monthly platform fees for subscription based communities, storage sales, offer premium search listings for communities, and to offer Teach the People as a white label service for organizations looking for an affordable, feature rich, and hosted LMS. </p>\n\n<p>Live Beta is set to launch August 28th, 2008.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/0196/196v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[184,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/0196/196v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[184,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/0196/196v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Teach The People","permalink":"teach-the-people","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3892/23892v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/3892/23892v2-max-250x250.png"],[[324,151],"assets/images/resized/0002/3892/23892v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Beckerman","permalink":"jason-beckerman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Backer","permalink":"josh-backer","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"TeachStreet","permalink":"teachstreet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/7469/17469v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/7469/17469v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,145],"assets/images/resized/0001/7469/17469v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$300k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":null,"source_description":null,"raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"302\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2167108&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2167108&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"302\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/2167108\">Teach the People - The People Powered University</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user907537\">Jason Beckerman</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.","description":"<p>fbFund Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
