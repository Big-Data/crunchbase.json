We are changing that with the Jobaline smart matching platform. Since 2011 we have been testing platform functionality, employer-worker matching, ranking and balancing algorithms, and audience monetization business models. Now, after processing more than 10,000 real-time interactions, we are ready for the next phase. </p>\n\n<p>Our team loves the way technology can drive positive social change. We know cloud computing, mobile technologies, the power of software platforms, and the beauty of simplicity. Our investors include Madrona Venture Group and a select team of angel investors from Seattle and New York. In addition to being internationally recognized experts in digital media, software as a service, and cloud computing, our investors and advisors understand the psychology of successful and rewarding working relationships. Jobaline, the platform of the future for hiring hourly workers is smart, social, mobile, simple, and coming soon.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0011/0184/110184v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0011/0184/110184v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[313,122],"assets/images/resized/0011/0184/110184v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"J.
