Users create group profiles for their various â€œcliquesâ€ or â€œcrewsâ€, post and share social plans, then connect with other groups based on common interests or activities. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike other social networking sites, MIXTT aims to facilitate offline interaction, as opposed to merely enhancing time spent at the computer.  In addition, MIXTT empowers users to meet people outside of their regular social circles, not just stay in touch with acquaintances they have already established.  MIXTT is the Web 2.0 tool for socializing, professional networking, dating, sports playing, or any realm of life that can benefit from a simple, natural, and laid-back way of meeting new people.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0002/4189/24189v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0002/4189/24189v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,143],"assets/images/resized/0002/4189/24189v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President & CMO","person":{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"Agraz","permalink":"diana-agraz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/1448/101448v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/1448/101448v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/1448/101448v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"StepOut","permalink":"stepout","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3914/23914v6-max-150x150.png"],[[121,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3914/23914v6-max-250x250.png"],[[121,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3914/23914v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/hRbNiUoA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>","description":"<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2008/09/online-dating-m.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"},{"embed_code":"<object id=\"otv_o_857044\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\"  classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param value=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/699921\" name=\"movie\" /><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\" /><param value=\"always\" name=\"allowScriptAccess\" /><param value=\"transparent\" name=\"wmode\" /><param value=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" name=\"flashvars\" /><embed name=\"otv_e_224548\" id=\"otv_e_965022\" flashvars=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/699921\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /></object>","description":"<p>tc50</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.mixtt.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2008/12/eve-peters-ceo-of-mixttcom-interview.html","title":"CEO Eve Peters Interview  12/08"}]}
