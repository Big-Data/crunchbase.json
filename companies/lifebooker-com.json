This marketplace is beneficial to the spas and salons who advertise on Lifebooker it serves as an alternative to traditional advertising, offering its partner businesses a pay-per-performance marketing tool. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We allow any businesses with an Internet connection to discount certain hours over others. These appointments are then advertised in real time, browsed through, and booked instantly online. Consumers find uniquely good deals, and businesses fill unused appointment times. The service is free for consumers, Pay-For-Performance for businesses, and ultimately a win-win for everyone,&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>&#8211; COO Dana Reichman.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s free until I get an appointment, and when I do, the cost is still so much less than doing my own advertising,&#8221;  </p>\n\n<p>&#8211; Jamie Ahn, owner of, Townhouse Spa &amp; Acqua Beauty Bar.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve created a more efficient marketplace benefiting all involved parties.
