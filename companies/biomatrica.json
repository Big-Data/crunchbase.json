The core technology is designed for use in preserving complex biological samples and assays and is based on the principles of anhydrobiosis (â€œlife without waterâ€), a natural mechanism that allows multicellular organisms to survive extreme environments. Biomatricaâ€™s current products stabilize DNA, RNA, proteins, cells and assays with no sample degradation, allowing scientists and clinicians to have pristine samples and reduce their reliance on freezers and drastically reduce shipping costs. Biomatrica products are used in laboratories performing life science research, from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to academic research and forensics laboratories. Custom services to stabilize additional sample types are also available. Biomatrica also offers SampleWareÂ® software, an easy-to-use, customizable laboratory management database that provides scientists with the means to store and organize their sample data, and directly supports samples stabilized by Biomatrica technology.
