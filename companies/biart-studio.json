The Company has developed its own technology biEngine that supports simultaneous development for video game consoles, mobile devices and PCs without production of additional content and unique game code.</p>\n\n<p>Biart Company LLC is incorporated in Delaware, USA. Its business office is in Texas, USA and a R&amp;D office in Moscow, Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Biart successfully released games for PCs, Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and Sony PlayStation Portable. Biart’s latest projects – Depth Hunter and Deep Black - have been released in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Biart is Intel’s platinum partner and NVIDIA’s technological partner. Biart has Microsoft and Sony development licenses and Sony publishing license for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles.</p>\n\n<p>Biart’s target is to occupy a niche of interactive products development for fans of underwater theme, divers and underwater hunters. Biart is going to launch the Online world for them. It will be a truly cross-platform product with possible access from any devices.</p>\n\n<p>Biart’s second target is licensing of the biEngine technology. biEngine is the optimal solution for third-party developers, who want to have high performance of 3D-projects on mobile devices, tablets and Intel® Ultrabooks.</p>\n\n<p>COMPANY HISTORY</p>\n\n<p>The Company was founded by Konstantin Popov, who is the author of all Company’s projects. The Company has worked only with own IPs from the moment it was founded.</p>\n\n<p>IPs of the Company: Diver: Deep Water Adventures, Deep Black (Underwater Was, U-WARS), Depth Hunter, Depth Hunter 2, Reef Aquarium, Fish &amp; Reefs.</p>\n\n<p>Biart was originally an independent Russian developer. Its first game, Diver: Deep Water Adventures, issued in 2007, was rated by the Russian publishing (rate 73%) and online (rate 75%) industry press. The game was also published in the USA and Europe. Some time later, the next project, Check Dive project, was published digitally.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, it was decided to create a new team to develop a multiplatform technology biEngine. The Company got licences from Sony and Microsoft. At the same time, the development of Deep Black project was launched, which was Biart’s first project for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, agreements were concluded with 505 Games, Just a Game, Noviy Disk companies to launch the Deep Black Project. At the same time, Biart became a partner of Intel and NVIDIA companies.</p>\n\n<p>In summer 2010, Reef Aquarium for Sony Playstation Portable (PSP Minis) was released.</p>\n\n<p>Development of Deep Black Reloaded was complete in 2011. The team started working on the Depth Hunter Project and it was decided to move business from Russia to the USA.</p>\n\n<p>Biart Company LLC was incorporated in Delaware in August 2011 with all agreements re-concluded for the new legal entity. The Russian company was closed and there’s only a R&amp;D office of Biart in Russia at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>All assets and operational activities of the company are in the USA. Biart’s official office is in Texas, USA. The Company has plans to set up a representative office in California, USA, in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Depth Hunter and Deep Black projects were released for PC in March 2012. The first project’s average rate was 70%, the average rate out of 146 reviews of Deep Black is 60%. Deep Black for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was released in April and August 2012. Depth Hunter was published by Lace Mamba Global and Koch Media in the UK on April 20th, 2012 and in German-speaking countries on May 18th, 2012. It is going to be released in other countries of the world, including Eastern Europe in Q4 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Biart decided to enter publishing business in 2012 and accordingly, the whole digital distribution of Depth Hunter was carried out without the involvement of outside publishers.</p>\n\n<p>Starting with February 2012, the Company has concluded direct distribution agreements with game portals to develop its digital distribution network. Biart got licences to develop and publish games for iOS and Mac OSX in March 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Biart is constantly developing its technology.

It has more than 12Mb (6676 pages) of source code.</p>\n\n<p>Starting with June 2012, biEngine 2.0 is being developed - a new version of the engine that is optimized for mobile and tablet devices. biEngine 2.0 will also include support of MacOS X and Linux. Its architecture is pre-adapted for the next-gen consoles.</p>\n\n<p>In May 2012, Doug Fisher, VP and General Manager of System Software Division of Intel Corporation talked about Deep Black, that is based on biEngine, at his keynote at IDF Brazil in Sao Paulo.</p>\n\n<p>Biart is working closely with Intel. Biart has optimized biEngine and increased gaming performance of Deep Black and Depth Hunter by more than 50%, which led to excellent results on the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge architecture. Since 2012, Biart takes part in optimization activities for Intel ® Ultrabooks.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9779/139779v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/9779/139779v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/9779/139779v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Deep Black","permalink":"deep-black","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/6040/206040v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/6040/206040v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,256],"assets/images/resized/0020/6040/206040v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"biEngine technology","permalink":"biengine-technology","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/2443/212443v2-max-150x150.png"],[[142,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/2443/212443v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/2443/212443v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"Depth Hunter","permalink":"depth-hunter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/6039/206039v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/6039/206039v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,256],"assets/images/resized/0020/6039/206039v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"Depth Hunter 2","permalink":"depth-hunter-2","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Konstantin","last_name":"Popov","permalink":"konstantin-popov-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0014/0268/140268v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,214],"assets/images/resized/0014/0268/140268v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,385],"assets/images/resized/0014/0268/140268v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Owner, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Konstantin","last_name":"Popov","permalink":"konstantin-popov","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0014/4726/144726v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,214],"assets/images/resized/0014/4726/144726v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,385],"assets/images/resized/0014/4726/144726v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Unity Technologies","permalink":"unity-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0003/7449/37449v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0003/7449/37449v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[327,180],"assets/images/resized/0003/7449/37449v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal services","is_past":true,"provider":{"name":"IEM Consulting GmBH","permalink":"iem-consulting-gmbh","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$4.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Private Investors","raised_amount":4200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":1000,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"R&D office","address1":"Kolomenskiy pr, 17","address2":"","zip_code":"115446","city":"Moscow","state_code":null,"country_code":"RUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"HQ office","address1":"10685-B Hazelhurst Dr. #
