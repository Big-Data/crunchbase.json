The companyâ€™s mobile applications enable fans to place and pay for in-venue offerings using their mobile phones without ever leaving the action. Orders are routed to the closest fulfillment location, whereby fans access express pick-up locations or have the product delivered to their seat. The platform alleviates congestion generated by peak-load demand and captures valuable data including who attends the event, where they are sitting, and what they are consuming. This data is being leveraged by properties to micro-target fans with relevant promotions, ticket offers, and integrated sponsor messaging. </p>\n\n<p>Bypass Lane technology is compatible with all major smartphone platforms (Apple, Android, Blackberry, and Mobile Web), leverages legacy point-of-sale infrastructure (including Micros/Quest/Agilysys), and seamlessly integrates into official team applications. Service is now offered at more than 40 sports and entertainment venues throughout Major League Baseball (MLB), National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), Minor League Baseball (MiLB), NCAA football and basketball facilities, and music venues.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0013/3834/133834v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/3834/133834v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0013/3834/133834v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.35M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/09/20/smallb1.html","source_description":"Austin start-up creates food in the fast lane","raised_amount":600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://vator.tv/news/2011-12-06-bypass-lane-checks-out-175m-for-concession-easy-pay","source_description":"Bypass Lane checks out $1.75m for concession easy pay","raised_amount":1750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Don","last_name":"Sanders","permalink":"don-sanders","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Casey","last_name":"Wasserman","permalink":"casey-wasserman","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Red","last_name":"McCombs","permalink":"red-mccombs","image":null}},{"company":{"name":"Capital Sports & Entertainment","permalink":"capital-sports-entertainment","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Bypass Headquarters","address1":"3301 Northland Drive","address2":"Suite 500","zip_code":"78731","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0013/4527/134527v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0013/4527/134527v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,347],"assets/images/resized/0013/4527/134527v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC8HPlpwHqA","title":"Bypass Lane at Dell Diamond"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZN9J6ZLUo0&feature=related","title":"Bypass Lane Demo"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100197570933140.2861612.7901471#!/video/video.php?v=10100406988922814","title":"Bypass at Rangers Ballpark"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEXmXgWsk8U","title":"\"What Did I Miss?\" Bypass Lane commercial..."}]}
