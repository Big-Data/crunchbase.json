The xMax system addresses the global spectrum crisis through technology that helps wireless network operators and their customers get more capacity out of existing spectrum allocations.</p>\n\n<p>The xMax network includes a complete ecosystem including access points (base stations), fixed and mobile personal WiFi hotspots, mobile switching centers, and network management and deployment tools. xMax incorporates xGâ€™s patented technologies to deliver the first fully mobile VoIP network offering an end-to-end IP infrastructure, excellent quality of service and low latency. </p>\n\n<p>xMax provides additional mobile bandwidth and new spectrum capacity to incumbent wireless operators, and can also remove spectrum barriers for emerging carriers, defense agencies, rural telecom firms, public safety organizations and utilities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0007/0040/70040v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0007/0040/70040v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0007/0040/70040v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman ","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"L.
