The site creates profiles based on users&#8217; viewing habits and identifys content related to their favorites. FFWD will transform your social network into a recommendation network, harnessing the human intuition and personal knowledge of your friends to identify content you all want to watch. </p>\n\n<p>FFWD is aiming to refine the psychology of channel surfing by providing an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; browsing experience that guides users to content according to their responses to options in sequence. You only have a few hours a day for video content. Spend more of that time actually enjoying it by using FFWD to find great video content via your tastes, your friends, and your natural actions.</p>\n\n<p>FFWD was formerly Vadver.com. They are currently working on applications for both Facebook and TiVo.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0000/0754/754v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,97],"assets/images/resized/0000/0754/754v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,97],"assets/images/resized/0000/0754/754v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"FFWD","permalink":"ffwd","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Koppula","permalink":"patrick-koppula","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9414/19414v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[149,168],"assets/images/resized/0001/9414/19414v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[149,168],"assets/images/resized/0001/9414/19414v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Wasserman","permalink":"mark-wasserman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Roberts","permalink":"greg-roberts","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,124],"assets/images/resized/0001/6733/16733v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[103,124],"assets/images/resized/0001/6733/16733v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[103,124],"assets/images/resized/0001/6733/16733v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Roberts","permalink":"nick-roberts","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.siliconvalleywire.com/svw/2007/08/san-francisc-16.html","source_description":null,"raised_amount":1700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ)","permalink":"draper-fisher-jurvetson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.775196,"longitude":-122.419204}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
