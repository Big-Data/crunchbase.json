The company&#8217;s signature products include Saavn.com, Saavn Music for iPhone, and Saavn Music for Android.</p>\n\n<p>Saavn shifted its core focus to become a music destination for fans of Bollywood and other Indic music in 2009, re-launching it flagship product, Saavn.com, with an improved user interface and faster, smarter search capabilities. Saavn.com offers free music search and streaming supported by display ads.</p>\n\n<p>Users of Saavn can create their own playlists on the go, or listen to editorialized playlists.
