We create dynamic experiences with our interactive platform and accompanying mobile apps.</p>\n\n<p>Since TouchTunes invented the first Internet-connected jukebox in 1998, the network has become the largest of its kind in over 55,000 bars and restaurants in North America. It is second only to iTunes for paid music downloads.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, the company reimagined the iconic experiences of the jukebox, karaoke and photo booth on our platform. Our music app allows users to control the jukebox from their mobile phones and has been downloaded 1MM times.</p>\n\n<p>For advertisers, TouchTunes has interactive and native formats, including Flash games, branded playlists, and photosâ€”that enable email collection and the reach of social media. TouchTunes is the largest 4th screen network in North America.</p>\n\n<p>TouchTunes is a privately held US corporation in New York City with additional offices in Montreal and Chicago.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0014/9968/149968v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0014/9968/149968v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0014/9968/149968v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Goldstuck","permalink":"charles-goldstuck","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Innovation Officer","person":{"first_name":"Ed","last_name":"Rivera","permalink":"ed-rivera","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/7631/167631v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/7631/167631v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/7631/167631v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Brecher","permalink":"steve-brecher","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Lane","permalink":"david-lane-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Barry","permalink":"patrick-barry-3","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"Shores","permalink":"patricia-shores","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Marketing Officer","person":{"first_name":"Christian","last_name":"McMahan","permalink":"christian-mcmahan","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Gallagher","permalink":"patrick-gallagher-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[76,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/1945/151945v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[126,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/1945/151945v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[165,325],"assets/images/resized/0015/1945/151945v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$45M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/touchtunes-interactive-networks-receives-45m-investment.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"TouchTunes Interactive Networks Receives $45M Investment","raised_amount":45000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"3i Group","permalink":"3i-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[70,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/9740/19740v1-max-150x150.png"],[[70,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/9740/19740v1-max-250x250.png"],[[70,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/9740/19740v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"VantagePoint Capital Partners","permalink":"vantagepoint-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/0782/10782v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/0782/10782v3-max-250x250.png"],[[254,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/0782/10782v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"850 Third Ave","address2":"Suite 15C","zip_code":"10022","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[94,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/8745/208745v2-max-150x150.png"],[[157,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/8745/208745v2-max-250x250.png"],[[283,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/8745/208745v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/8746/208746v2-max-150x150.png"],[[199,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/8746/208746v2-max-250x250.png"],[[358,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/8746/208746v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-12/the-rise-of-the-e-jukebox","title":"The Rise of the E-Jukebox"},{"external_url":"http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/genre/rock-and-pop/the-beatles-coming-soon-to-a-digital-jukebox-1006494552.story","title":"The Beatles: Coming Soon to a (Digital) Jukebox Near You"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663333/frog-creates-a-jukebox-for-people-who-ve-never-touched-a-jukebox","title":"Frog Creates a Jukebox for People Who've Never Touched a Jukebox"},{"external_url":"http://www.psfk.com/2011/03/touchtunes-virtuo-re-inventing-the-jukebox.html","title":"TouchTunes Virtuo: Re-Inventing the Jukebox"},{"external_url":"http://www.pcworld.com/article/218026/15_4g_apps_that_will_matter_in_2011.html","title":"15 4G Apps That Will Matter In 2011"}]}
