Letting money makers make money.</p>\n\n<p>People have always had trouble trying to push a global marketing campaign that will build brand awareness.  It’s been difficult trying to reach people who live in smaller cities.  There is risk and challenge to finding resources who will scour local regions across the globe and stick marketing material to promote your product.  Adecode helps businesses create marketing campaigns that are global all the while allowing their advertising campaigns to be spread to an unlimited number of regions.</p>\n\n<p>How does Adecode create a marketing campaign that leverages the global audience?</p>\n\n<p>Adecode leverages the use of a QR code.  With the rapid growth of the QR code used as a mobile site visiting link, Adecode takes the QR code, applies a link that goes to your site, and leverages “Spreaders” from around the world to print your advertisements and promote wherever, whenever. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s take Tony for example.  If he was walking down the street and saw a printed flyer with your advertisement, he has the choice of visiting the link.  In fact, if he does not visit the link, the Merchant still wins because the Merchant was able to promote their product simply because Tony read the flyer.  When Tony decides to read the QR code and visit the link, the Merchant would have gained a very strong marketing lead to their product. </p>\n\n<p>How do Spreaders earn money from Adecode?</p>\n\n<p>Every time someone visits the QR code link, the spreader will earn cash!  Each Merchant can specify how much they are willing to pay for each visit.  Spreaders will follow these Merchants and print out the various campaigns and stick them up across town.  When a visitor scans the QR code and visits the link, the Spreader will earn money. </p>\n\n<p>If our friend Tony was going to class at his University campus and notices a flyer that is promoting a new band, he may want to visit the link.  He will scan the QR code, and the link could take him to a video promoting the band, or their website, or a site to buy tickets.  The options are endless. </p>\n\n<p>So here we are, Adecode is launched in Beta.  If you are part of this, welcome and we hope you are ready to be a Merchant and get your brand out there or a Spreader who is ready to make money.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0016/7951/167951v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0016/7951/167951v4-max-250x250.png"],[[285,62],"assets/images/resized/0016/7951/167951v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Scotellaro","permalink":"michele-scotellaro","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"Parisi","permalink":"antonio-parisi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Milan","last_name":"DavÃ©","permalink":"milan-dav","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
