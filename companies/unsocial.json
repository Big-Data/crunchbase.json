It is a multi-platform application and available on both iPhone and Android phones &#8211; versions available on Blackberry, Windows Mobile and Nokia as well as an HTML 5 version &#8211; will be coming soon.</p>\n\n<p>Unsocial has been in development since early 2010 and is launching in beta. Initially, it will be available in San Francisco &#8211; with plans to expand to other cities soon.</p>\n\n<p>Launched in October 2010 at Venturebeatâ€™s DiscoveryBeat, the Seattle-based startup (founded by Kiran Modak, Justin Richardson and Santosh Khare) is officially coming out of stealth and unveiling its iPhone and Android apps.</p>\n\n<p>According to Evelyn Rusli of TechCrunch, here&#8217;s how Unsocial works: &#8220;A user signs up via his or her LinkedIn account and Unsocial uses that profile to collect basic information on the personâ€™s career. The user inputs &#8216;smart tags,&#8217; or rather keywords, that describe his/her professional background (for example you might include &#8216;journalist,&#8217; &#8216;writer,&#8217; or &#8216;technology&#8217;) and the traits of people s/he is seeking.</p>\n\n<p>When youâ€™re ready to use the application, you simply open it up and click on the first button, &#8216;People,&#8217; which will show you relevant, nearby matches, if you find someone you want to connect with you can send a direct message through the platform (or e-mail/call them if that information is available). The service is ideal for large conferences or similar events where attendees have a limited amount of time to identify high-value contacts.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/6070/106070v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0010/6070/106070v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,155],"assets/images/resized/0010/6070/106070v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Santosh","last_name":"Khare","permalink":"santosh-khare","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Kiran","last_name":"Modak","permalink":"kiran-modak","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Richardson","permalink":"justin-richardson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/05/unsocial-closes-seed-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Unsocial Closes Seed Financing Round","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":23,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,130],"assets/images/resized/0010/6074/106074v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,217],"assets/images/resized/0010/6074/106074v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,391],"assets/images/resized/0010/6074/106074v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0010/6075/106075v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0010/6075/106075v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0010/6075/106075v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
