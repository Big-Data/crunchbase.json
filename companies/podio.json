Podio gives people more power than they&#8217;ve ever had before to manage their work better, smarter and in their own way. </p>\n\n<p>Combining hundreds of specialized and flexible work apps with messaging, tasks, reporting, workflow and contact management, Podio lets you build and shape the online workplace most fitting to your role. It eliminates scattered, unorganized work routines, and replaces multiple products from different companies with a single environment and a single login. </p>\n\n<p>Podio is already trusted by thousands of teams, companies and organizations worldwide who use it to facilitate a particular work process or to connect all their work activity. </p>\n\n<p>Currently based in Copenhagen, Podio is building a multinational team of German, French, British, and Danish employees.
