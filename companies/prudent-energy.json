Prudentâ€™s VRB-ESSÂ® allows utility customers to balance load, bridge generation, and regulate voltage and frequency â€“ in one low maintenance system.  Prudent also sells or leases VRBÂ® systems and services to commercial onsite generators and telecoms companies to reduce their operating expenses and provide backup power.  Unlike other advanced battery systems, Prudentâ€™s VRBÂ® system operates at room temperature, cycles at 100% without damage to power capacity, and uses an energy-storing electrolyte that never wears out.
