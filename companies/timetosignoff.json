Plus each of the 9 nightly stories includes an interesting fact that readers can remember so that the next day they feel even smarter. It is very facts based, memorable and useful to its audience.</p>\n\n<p>SignOff is already available in 3 cities in the US: New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. It will expand soon in couple of others and abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Given the challenges faced by the publishing industry today, repackaging a news service as an end-of-day update for the busiest readers adds a clever twist that may just set SignOff apart. The local spin adds yet more appeal.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/7128/127128v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[155,191],"assets/images/resized/0012/7128/127128v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[155,191],"assets/images/resized/0012/7128/127128v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Marc-Henri","last_name":"Magdelenat","permalink":"marc-henri-magdelenat","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Ceria","permalink":"arthur-ceria","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New York","address1":"29E 19th street","address2":"5th Floor","zip_code":"10003","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0012/7127/127127v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0012/7127/127127v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0012/7127/127127v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
