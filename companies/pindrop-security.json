The startup has developed a caller-ID product that helps detect, report and mitigate phone fraud by identifying key attributes of any phone call including the device used (based on audio analysis), ID, call path, and geographic point of origin. Pindrop says that its technology essentially creates a “fingerprint” that helps clients identify and avoid fraud.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0018/7496/187496v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0018/7496/187496v1-max-250x250.png"],[[268,53],"assets/images/resized/0018/7496/187496v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Paul Judge","permalink":"dr-paul-judge","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/4363/74363v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[107,160],"assets/images/resized/0007/4363/74363v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[107,160],"assets/images/resized/0007/4363/74363v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Vijay","last_name":"A.
