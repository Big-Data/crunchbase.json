Precog allows companies to store, integrate, and analyze large volumes of measured data. Featuring the industry-leading implementation of Quirrel, the &#8220;R for big data&#8221; statistical language, the Precog platform  allows companies to create analytics or predictive models that can be deployed as new products or features inside existing products.</p>\n\n<p>Companies use Precog to build analytics and reporting into their applications, to turn existing data assets into new data products that can then be resold, and to build advanced analytical features like recommendations and personalizations.</p>\n\n<p>Precog is the next-generation technology that spawned out of ReportGrid, a 2011 TechStar&#8217;s company. Founded by veteran technologist and entrepreneur John A. De Goes, Precog is tackling the big data productization problem head-on through a combination of innovative technology and obsessive attention to usability.</p>\n\n<p>Precog is funded by RTP Ventures, Resonant Ventures, David G. Cohen, and other seasoned angels. Its board of directors includes SendGrid CEO Jim Franklin, and serial entrepreneur Kirill Sheynkman.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0015/6983/156983v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0015/6983/156983v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,126],"assets/images/resized/0015/6983/156983v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"A.
