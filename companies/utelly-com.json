Itâ€™s time for advanced technology to make TV entertaining again.</p>\n\n<p>Utelly is the smart application that controls TV and recommends the best shows based on consumer profiles and behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>The initial idea comes from the frustration generated whilst trying to find something to watch on linear TV. The offering has grown over the past years (600+ channels in the UK atm) yet the UI (the in-TV app, aka EPG) is still archaic, dating back from the times where there were only 6 channels. </p>\n\n<p>Using mobile technology and serious data crunching, coupled with extensive TV experience, Utelly aims to fix this and make TV entertaining again.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0022/2973/222973v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,103],"assets/images/resized/0022/2973/222973v2-max-250x250.png"],[[278,115],"assets/images/resized/0022/2973/222973v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Romain","last_name":"Eude","permalink":"romain-eude","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/9162/149162v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/9162/149162v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/9162/149162v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0022/2972/222972v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,137],"assets/images/resized/0022/2972/222972v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,248],"assets/images/resized/0022/2972/222972v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
