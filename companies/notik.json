Bidders on such auctions purchase tokens at a price of $0.60 each. Each bid raises the price by a single penny. An item worth hundreds may end up selling for far less, but a final sale value of  $35.00 for an item such as an Ipod ($300 value) equals 3500 bids at $0.60 each meaning that the charity has raised $2,100. One person has won a cheap item and everyone else has donated anywhere from $0.60-$20.00 to the charity that has listed the item.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Zalman","last_name":"Notik","permalink":"zalman-notik","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Quibids.com","permalink":"quibids-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$74.5k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":74500,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"478 Albany ave.","address2":"","zip_code":"11213","city":"Brooklyn","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Seed funding $80,000","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":4,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"NOTIK","permalink":"notik"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKJf79LM1kc&feature=player_embedded","title":"Youtube video"}]}
