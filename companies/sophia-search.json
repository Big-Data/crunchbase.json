There is no external meta-data required: no ontology, no dictionary, no thesaurus, no RDF-augmenting and improving other search engines. Using a proprietary set of algorithms, the content enrichment process automatically creates semantic metadata for your information. Because it is based on a model of linguistics (called semiotics), the metadata discovered and extracted by Sophiaâ€™s Contextual Discovery Engine (CDE) is exposed as XML through RESTful web services.</p>\n\n<p>Sophia Search Limited is an Irish software company, founded in 2007.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/1789/161789v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/1789/161789v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,181],"assets/images/resized/0016/1789/161789v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CSO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Vladimir","last_name":"Dobrynin","permalink":"vladimir-dobrynin-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"J Horn","permalink":"chris-j-horn-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"dave-patterson-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/2132/162132v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/2132/162132v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/2132/162132v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"V.P.
