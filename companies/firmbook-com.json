Whether it is by phone, email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.</p>\n\n<p>It can be hard to figure out which of these contact ways a possible client would prefer. Some might prefer good old fashioned emailing. While some of the more modern users would like to connect with you through social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn. Others may just want to call you on the phone. All people have different needs and preferences. With a Firmbook business card you can let them make the choice.</p>\n\n<p>A Firmbook business card gives a great view of the different ways to reach you. Let your customers and partners choose the way which they want to get in touch by sending them a link to your business card.\nWe have put a lot of effort into making Firmbook as easy to use as possible. In the development phase we have focused on simplicity and functionality. As a result we have a polished product with some unique key features and no useless rubbish.</p>\n\n<p>A quick overview of the functionalities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The business card itself. It is structured the same way as an electronic vCard is, and is available as a downloadable .vcf file for the users. Including an image, if you choose to upload one.</p></li>\n<li><p>A unique identifier that you can choose, to get an easy memorable reference for your business card. Mine is, for example, firmbook.com/amo/ - where amo is my identifier.</p></li>\n<li><p>Find me elsewhere links. These links will appear on the right side of your business card and can be used to connect to other webpages of your choice. E.g. your Facebook Profile, your LinkedIn profile or maybe a personal website? The only limitation is your imagination!</p></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0011/8954/118954v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0011/8954/118954v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0011/8954/118954v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarter","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"DNK","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
