Fast, low cost translation services in all major languages provided by native speakers 24/7, all around the world. Instant pricing. Order and review online.</p>\n\n<p>This professional translation service can be used for all publications and documents; it can become a dedicated multilingual outsourcing support for service sectors, the production of emails, letters, product description, annual reports, agreements, sales brochures, websites and just about any text into just about (almost) any language.</p>\n\n<p>What is the idea?</p>\n\n<p>Entirely Web-based\nThe company emphasizes the convenience factor for customers, describing itself as an â€œonline pricing serviceâ€ for translation, as opposed to a website that simply asks you to telephone or send e-mails to the service company.</p>\n\n<p>We are addressing some issues that have been raised by customers regarding translation prices and delivery time. Before TranslationsPal there were two existing options: machine translation and translation companies.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Generally, the machine translation is speedier than the manual translation. Ten times, twenty times more? It doesnâ€™t matter when it comes to getting things done the right way. Because sometimes the result would change your future business. Or future relationship. As for translation, the first most important factor is QUALITY, not quantity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Traditional translation provides excellent results but it would simply be too slow and too costly.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now TranslationsPal offers human translation services that suppose speed as machine translation and quality as traditional translation. Yes, human translations are not free, but their dividends well justify their costs.</p>\n\n<p>We are also addressing some issues that have been raised by translators regarding â€œnon-translationâ€ costs. Using TranslationsPal you do not need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Buying translation software tools</li>\n<li>Paying membership fee for getting listed or accessing to job postings</li>\n<li>Spending time in biding for the job</li>\n<li>Spending time in negotiating with the clients</li>\n<li>Spending taking free sample jobs, for winning the jobs or simply the opportunities to win the jobs</li>\n<li>Paying agency fee </li>\n<li>Handling invoices, payments, urging the clients to pay on time, etc.</li>\n<li>Occasionally, loss because of the bad clients refuse to pay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What TranslationsPal does to minimize the non-translation cost at translator side?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Guaranteed payment: you don&#8217;t need to cash the earning job by job. Weâ€™re sure translators will be paid for any job they do.</li>\n<li>Flexibility: you can start or stop working on a job at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How does it work?</p>\n\n<p>TranslationsPal is an AUTOMATED translation workplace where translation projects are being posted by service buyers and translated by service providers.</p>\n\n<p>Clients can now review their project costs online without hard sales telephone conversations by translation suppliers. They can, in the privacy of their own offices, compile budgets with accurate pricing for high quality, speedy, low-cost translation for any length of project.</p>\n\n<p>Clients can deposit files for translation at TranslationsPalâ€™s service via a secure connection website and the work will be processed immediately. Clients are kept informed of the status of their project via TranslationsPalâ€™s unique web-based interface and even pay for the work on-line securely.</p>\n\n<p>NO human project management is involved when using TranslationsPal.</p>\n\n<p>Who works on your documents?</p>\n\n<p>TranslationsPal has created a global network of professional translators all over the world. TranslationsPal works only with native language speakers who are familiar with the current use and conventions of a language.\nCrowdsourcing and outsourcing</p>\n\n<p>To avoid human project management, TranslationsPal is working under the crowdsourcing principle.  Crowdsourcing is the act of taking a task traditionally performed by an employee or contractor, and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people or community in the form of an open call. Crowdsourcing provides fast results, thus saving project management time and costs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/3951/73951v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0007/3951/73951v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,156],"assets/images/resized/0007/3951/73951v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Petya","last_name":"Ivanova","permalink":"petya-ivanova","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0007/3950/73950v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0007/3950/73950v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,244],"assets/images/resized/0007/3950/73950v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/translationspal-com-a-real-time-translation-service","title":"KillerStartups.com"},{"external_url":"http://startupmeme.com/online-real-time-translation-by-humans-with-translationspal/","title":"Startup Meme"}]}
