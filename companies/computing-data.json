Most of the people at Computing Data are originally from the Arcade and Video game industry. Game companies involved include CAPCOM, RARE, ZIPPO GAMES, US GOLD, TIERTEX, PARKER BROTHERS, PSYGNOSIS among others&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>The new aim of the company is to bring the skills required in writing video games to the software application market, making compact, hi-speed and fluid applications that shame the competition!</p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2008 and regularly updated, the acclaimed Elementary Reports and itâ€™s licenced variations already have over an incredible 750 schools and 3,000 teachers creating annual / end of term student reports, making it the market leader in school report writing systems. In 2009 Computing Data licensed a version of itâ€™s school report writing â€˜engineâ€™ to Nottingham based ReportPlus. ReportPlus is widely regarded as a natural successor to the popular ReportAssist program that was used in the majority of UK schools.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 Elementary Reports name will be changed to ReportComplete! - the ElementaryReports, PrimaryReports and SecondaryReports domain names will be used to promote the package (and itâ€™s licenced versions) in various territories.</p>\n\n<p>Also in 2011, Computing Data will be launching a new, exciting and free application that can be used by teacher and parents to help teach reading, writing and mathematics!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/9818/29818v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[102,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/9818/29818v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[102,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/9818/29818v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Ball","permalink":"anthony-ball","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Company Secretary","person":{"first_name":"Faye","last_name":"O'Neill","permalink":"faye-oneill","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"329 Preston Road,","address2":"","zip_code":"PR2 5JT","city":"Grimsargh Preston","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":53.8070285,"longitude":-2.6172859}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/9817/29817v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0002/9817/29817v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,308],"assets/images/resized/0002/9817/29817v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
