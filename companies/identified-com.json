Identified Score is a measurement of how in demand your professional background is to companies right now.

Identified&#8217;s goal is to make the Identified Score the standard measure of relevance in the professional world. The Identified Score is helping professionals connect with other professionals, companies find employees, and professionals find future employers.</p>\n\n<p>Identified was founded by Stanford University students Adeyemi Ajao and Brendan Wallace as a research project between the engineering school and MBA program.
