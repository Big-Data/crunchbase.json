Here&#8217;s how it works: teachers upload proposals for needed resources or projects and users can view proposals and make donations. Each proposal gets its own page with a written description from the teacher and detailed information on the classroom, project, school and funding needed. DonorsChoose.org reviews each submission before posting it to their site. </p>\n\n<p>All proposals can be easily browsed by subject, region, type of resource, student profiles, type of school, etc. When you find a proposal you like you can share it with friends, donate part or donate the full amount. Users can also make a donation directly to DonorsChoose.org. </p>\n\n<p>DonorsChoose.org&#8217;s founder and CEO Charles Best used to be a Bronx schoolteacher. He is planning for his company to become completely self-sustainable as its expands nationally. DonorsChoose.org opened in the fall of 2007 to every public school in the country. </p>\n\n<p>According to <a

Yahoo&#8217;s David Filo donated five Yahoo engineers full-time for five months to rewrite DonorChoose.org&#8217;s code base. </p>\n\n<p>The site is slightly similar to non-profit <a
