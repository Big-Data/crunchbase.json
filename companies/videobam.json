Unlike YouTube and Vimeo, VideoBam is geared towards allowing members to control the content based on their personal preferences.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-Browser Compatibility \nAs content is delivered to smaller devices, the inability to view Flash on such devices as the iPad and the iPhone, make it difficult to reach an audience for many content providers.</p>\n\n<p>VideoBam video hosting supports most video formats. In addition, VideoBam offers the ability to quickly encode in H.264 and stream to all desktop and media devices whether Flash is enabled or not. The media file format also paves the way for playback on upcoming Internet TV and tablet devices.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0011/4325/114325v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0011/4325/114325v2-max-250x250.png"],[[301,62],"assets/images/resized/0011/4325/114325v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Oliver","permalink":"adam-oliver","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"ivan-wong","image":{"available_sizes":[[[87,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8708/128708v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[145,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/8708/128708v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[185,317],"assets/images/resized/0012/8708/128708v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Ivan Wong</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Florian","last_name":"Cervenka","permalink":"florian-cervenka","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Vimeo","permalink":"vimeo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1624/1624v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/1624/1624v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/1624/1624v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"YouTube","permalink":"youtube","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/0724/10724v372-max-150x150.png"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/0724/10724v372-max-250x250.png"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/0724/10724v372-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"MegaVideo","permalink":"megavideo-2","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Photobucket, Corp.","permalink":"ontela","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0002/1122/21122v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/1122/21122v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/1122/21122v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Tinypic","permalink":"tinypic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0003/2800/32800v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,184],"assets/images/resized/0003/2800/32800v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,332],"assets/images/resized/0003/2800/32800v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Flixya Entertainment, LLC","address1":"330 Townsend Street Suite 115","address2":"","zip_code":"94107","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,142],"assets/images/resized/0011/4323/114323v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,237],"assets/images/resized/0011/4323/114323v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,428],"assets/images/resized/0011/4323/114323v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[89,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/4324/114324v2-max-150x150.png"],[[149,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/4324/114324v2-max-250x250.png"],[[268,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/4324/114324v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
