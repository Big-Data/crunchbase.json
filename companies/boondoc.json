This makes the Boondoc environment one that is safe and exclusive. </p>\n\n<p>While all physicians have networks of colleagues and peers on whom they rely for advice and counsel, Boondoc will break down barriers allowing that network of trust to grow exponentially. Doctors can collaborate across specialties and across the country. With our tools, physicians will be able to discuss, question, and report on cases and findings that are of interest and importance in real-time. </p>\n\n<p>Greater and faster access to information, trends, and insights for physicians means better quality of care for patients. </p>\n\n<p>Boondoc Inc. â€“ Using the power of the crowd to accelerate change in the Canadian healthcare system.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0022/3443/223443v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0022/3443/223443v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,157],"assets/images/resized/0022/3443/223443v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Clory, MD","permalink":"mike-clory-md","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","person":{"first_name":"Will","last_name":"Harris","permalink":"will-harris","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Duncan","last_name":"Enman","permalink":"duncan-enman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"56 Zinck Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"B4C1V7","city":"Sackville","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0022/3442/223442v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,134],"assets/images/resized/0022/3442/223442v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,242],"assets/images/resized/0022/3442/223442v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
