Plastiqâ€™s operations are carried out via an online interface allowing merchants and consumers to link directly and instantaneously from anywhere in the world. By partnering directly with credit card associations, issuers and processors, Plastiq can offer attractive rates and better value directly to consumers and merchants. Plastiq&#8217;s unique model alleviates high credit card fees to the merchant by instead charging consumers a nominal fee to use the service. The fees assessed are dependent upon the credit card brand, location of the merchant and industry. Fees can also be subsidized by merchants as desired. </p>\n\n<p>Customers now have the power to pay bills in the method they desire. Plastiq facilitates payments for tuition, taxes, rent, donations, country club dues, auction purchases and boat and plane charters. </p>\n\n<p>Plastiq is headquartered in Boston, with satellite operations in Toronto, and has backing from top advisors and investors across the financial sector, academia, and consumer technology including Flybridge Capital and Atlas Ventures\nSpecialties\nHigh-end Payment Verticals, Payment Augmentation, Processor Integrations</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0018/9787/189787v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,60],"assets/images/resized/0018/9787/189787v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[208,60],"assets/images/resized/0018/9787/189787v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$2.35M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2012/05/14/daily1-Credit-card-processing-startup-raises-235M.html","source_description":"Credit card processing startup raises $2.35M","raised_amount":2350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":14,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Atlas Venture","permalink":"atlas-venture","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/3403/3403v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Flybridge Capital Partners","permalink":"flybridge-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/3209/23209v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/3209/23209v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[229,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/3209/23209v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0018/9788/189788v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0018/9788/189788v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,320],"assets/images/resized/0018/9788/189788v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
