Members also have the option of using the unique and innovative â€œBrainâ€ to suggest the best time to meet for the event. </p>\n\n<p>Users are able to log into the website using their facebook account (which imports all friends to ActivityBrain) or by creating a new account. Once logged in, the home page offers suggestions for activities that fit the members interests and free times. From there they can create the activity with just a few clicks. </p>\n\n<p>The core feature of the site is its event creation system. Users have the option of selecting the best time and date of the activity (one-time or repeating) or they can get help from &#8220;The Brain&#8221;. The Brain looks through inviteeâ€™s schedules and finds the best time they are available to meet. For example, if a student wanted to get a group meeting together, they would be able to ask the brain for help and see the common free time among the groupâ€™s schedules. An event creator also has the option of letting the brain evolve a best time as invitees sign up for the event. Examples of how the different activity creation methods work can be found here: http://www.activitybrain.com/tour</p>\n\n<p>Each event that gets created receives a dedicated activity page. Here, the invitees can RSVP, add comments, and view details about the event. If the event is repeating, an invitee can forward to a future date to RSVP and add comments.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0004/8976/48976v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,36],"assets/images/resized/0004/8976/48976v2-max-250x250.png"],[[285,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/8976/48976v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"event creation tools","permalink":"event-creation-tools","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Socializr.com","permalink":"socializr-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"patent","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Schwegman Lundberg & Woessner P.A.","permalink":"schwegman-lundberg-woessner-p-a","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/8972/48972v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0004/8972/48972v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,377],"assets/images/resized/0004/8972/48972v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0004/8973/48973v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,226],"assets/images/resized/0004/8973/48973v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,406],"assets/images/resized/0004/8973/48973v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0004/8974/48974v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,178],"assets/images/resized/0004/8974/48974v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,321],"assets/images/resized/0004/8974/48974v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/8975/48975v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,209],"assets/images/resized/0004/8975/48975v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,377],"assets/images/resized/0004/8975/48975v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
