Markets of opportunity include human and veterinary diagnostic, environmental, biohazard, bioterrorism, agricultural commodity, and food safety testing. Our technology offers remarkably faster and less expensive results than existing methods. Current diagnostic tests can take hours to days from the time a sample is taken to delivery of results. Rapid Diagnostekâ€™s IntelliProbe Immunosensorâ„¢ (IPIâ„¢) platform can deliver results at the point of sampling in under 60 seconds. The sensor has performed as intended in the laboratory and the company is now developing a fully functioning device and initial assays to aggressively move towards commercialization. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0007/5460/75460v1-max-150x150.png"],[[232,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/5460/75460v1-max-250x250.png"],[[232,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/5460/75460v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President, CEO, Director ","person":{"first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Norris","permalink":"harry-norris","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Knapp","permalink":"paul-knapp","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"https://www.fis.dowjones.com/article.aspx?ProductIDFromApplication=32&aid=DJFVW00020100128e61t0012x&r=Rss&s=DJFVW","source_description":"Peak Ridge Ag Fund Makes First Deal, Leads Rapid Diagnostek's $4M Series B  ","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":29,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Peak Ridge Capital","permalink":"peak-ridge-capital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3076/103076v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[139,186],"assets/images/resized/0010/3076/103076v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[139,186],"assets/images/resized/0010/3076/103076v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1301 Gateway Circle","address2":"Suite #400","zip_code":"54016","city":"Hudson","state_code":"WI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
