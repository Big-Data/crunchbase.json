Since the site launched in October 2010 it has attracted hundreds of eco sellers selling over 7,000 unique products from across the world ranging from Fairtrade coffee, to handmade natural soap, to up-cycled tshirts.</p>\n\n<p>The website also simplifies the often complicated  process of shopping ethically by explaining what each products ethical credentials and certificates mean. Shoppers can also learn more about each seller by interact with sellers reading interviews and interacting with them via the site&#8217;s own social network and video system, where they can learn more about the story and people behind the products they buy.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal as a company is not only to give (often small one man band) sellers a platform to sell products but also to give consumers all the tools and information they need to demystify ethical shopping, and to create open debates about key issues that will help shape our planet.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0013/6614/136614v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0013/6614/136614v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0013/6614/136614v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Dainter","permalink":"jason-dainter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/6604/136604v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/6604/136604v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/6604/136604v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Liam","last_name":"Patterson","permalink":"liam-patterson","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Dainter","permalink":"jason-dainter-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£225k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/17/etsy-for-eco-ethical-community-raises-300000-in-seed-funding/","source_description":"“Etsy For Eco” Ethical Community Raises $300,000+ In Seed Funding","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":17,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Giuliano","last_name":"Stiglitz","permalink":"giuliano-stiglitz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,86],"assets/images/resized/0011/4625/114625v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,144],"assets/images/resized/0011/4625/114625v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[320,185],"assets/images/resized/0011/4625/114625v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Kelvin","last_name":"Au","permalink":"kelvin-au","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"Turner","permalink":"mary-turner","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Barnes","permalink":"robert-barnes","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London Office","address1":"32 - 38 Scrutton Street","address2":"","zip_code":"E1 4RP","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0013/6613/136613v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,129],"assets/images/resized/0013/6613/136613v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,232],"assets/images/resized/0013/6613/136613v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.shell-livewire.org/home/alumni/grand-ideas-award-winners/2009-winners/2009-april/liam-patterson/","title":"Shell Livewire Grand Ideas Award"},{"external_url":"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/70/ethical_one-stop_shop_wins_award","title":"Ethical One Stop Shop Wins Award"}]}
