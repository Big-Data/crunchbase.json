And as they started figuring out more, they saw a need for helping small businesses manage their inbound calls and messages over multiple phones. Soon, they had a virtual business phone system with features like extensions, voicemail, conference, dialer, SMS keyword responder etc. It is secure, fault tolerant &amp; performant. With Exotel, you can create highly interactive &amp; intelligent voice SMS flows within minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The Exotel Phone System is being used by a variety of small businesses already. Do take a look at what their experience as been.  They are seeing a positive impact on these businesses, and are excited about the next round of enhancements that they are already working on.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0019/7672/197672v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0019/7672/197672v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0019/7672/197672v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Shivakumar","last_name":"Ganesan","permalink":"shivakumar-ganesan","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://yourstory.in/2012/03/exotel-raises-2-5-crores-series-a-funding-from-mumbai-angels-blume-ventures/","source_description":"Exotel Raises 2.5 Crores Series A Funding from Mumbai Angels & Blume Ventures","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":27,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mumbai Angels","permalink":"mumbai-angels","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/9396/29396v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/9396/29396v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[305,93],"assets/images/resized/0002/9396/29396v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Blume Ventures","permalink":"blume-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0021/0012/210012v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0021/0012/210012v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[328,71],"assets/images/resized/0021/0012/210012v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Bangalore","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
