We are Glasgowâ€™s newest stars, and we intend to build on the first class reputation we have already established. </p>\n\n<p>We provide the most effective and dynamic method of raising companiesâ€™ brand profiles and getting their message across to their target demographic. By allowing us to become â€˜the faceâ€™ of their organisation, they can be sure that the image and standard they project will be world class and second to none.</p>\n\n<p>In the current economic climate, it makes no sense to throw money away on television advertising campaigns that people flick past without registering, radio campaigns nobody listens to or magazine inserts that are discarded without a glance. We can offer the most direct and effective way of increasing clientsâ€™ revenue and customer base.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0016/4906/164906v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,138],"assets/images/resized/0016/4906/164906v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,248],"assets/images/resized/0016/4906/164906v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Enigma Marketing Ltd ","address1":"34 St Enoch Square","address2":"5th Floor Station House","zip_code":"","city":"Glasgow ","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
