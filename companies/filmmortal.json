The startup&#8217;s main goal is to help talented filmmakers and future Cannes, Sundance or even Oscar darlings - get funding for their dream projects (both movies and TV shows). Some of the best films and shows of our times were indie projects; being rejected by major studios and later on gaining cult and even pop-culture status!</p>\n\n<p>The advertisers get a chance to place or integrate their products in upcoming movies and shows; this could be in the form of the product being shown or used in the movie during emotionally engaging scenes, or perhaps even integrated into the storyline. There is also the possibility of barter arrangements between the two parties where the advertisers provide things like crew transport, hotel stays, catering, props, equipment etc. in exchange for having their products placed in the project. </p>\n\n<p>These kinds of deals were previously done behind closed doors; between privileged ad agencies and major movie studios. Filmmortal makes the entire process simple, transparent and fast (both parties being notified in the inboxes or on their Blackberryâ€™s whenever a new project is listed; or whenever their proposals are bid on or finalized).</p>\n\n<p>For film buffs a special section called &#8220;BRANDSPOTTERS&#8221; which is a massive database of every product placement in every film from 2000-2009. They can do a live Ajax search using either film or brand and it will show what film or what brand was featuref in what movie. Anything missing from the database, BRANDSPOTTERS can â€œsuggest or addâ€. Top BRANDSPOTTERS will have the chance to be in upcoming movies, receive special edition dvdâ€™s, attend premieres, film festival screenings etc.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0003/5870/35870v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/5870/35870v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,111],"assets/images/resized/0003/5870/35870v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sahil","last_name":"Kazi","permalink":"sahil-kazi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[68,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9493/139493v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[114,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/9493/139493v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/9493/139493v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Self</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"IndieFlix","permalink":"indieflix","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9451/19451v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,237],"assets/images/resized/0001/9451/19451v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,237],"assets/images/resized/0001/9451/19451v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Parent Company, PR, Marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Webtronaut Innovations","permalink":"webtronaut-innovations","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0013/9497/139497v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0013/9497/139497v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/9497/139497v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$155k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Private","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":40000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":18,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":65000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94040","city":"Mountain View","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.3785351,"longitude":-122.086585}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"225\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3257633&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3257633&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/3257633\">Filmmortal Demo Video For Advertisers</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user1210077\">Filmmortal .com</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.","description":"<p>Filmmortal for Advertisers</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"225\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2969337&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2969337&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/2969337\">Filmmortal.com Demo Video -
