With the belief that there had to be a better way to advertise and find flatshares, Simon set out to write the first few lines of code for what would become Apartli.</p>\n\n<p>By having users sign in with Facebook, Apartli shows people looking for a flatshare if their friends (or friends of their friends) have a  spare room to let, and gives them results relevant to their preferences. This significantly increases trust, reduces the risk of scams and makes the flat hunting process much more efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Posting is nearly as simple as looking. Apartli makes it easier by significantly reducing the time required to complete a beautiful, high-quality ad, providing a trusted environment to look for a flatmate, and making it easier to manage viewings.</p>\n\n<p>Finding a fantastic place to live should enjoyable and stress-free. And that&#8217;s what we aim to enable with Apartli.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/0062/220062v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0022/0062/220062v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0022/0062/220062v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Rohrbach","permalink":"simon-rohrbach","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
