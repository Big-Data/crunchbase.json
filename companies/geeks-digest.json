A technology enthusiast, Ryan Bolanowski, purchased the GeeksDigest.com domain name to create a news orientated blog in effort to keep people in touch with the growing technology industry. Months later Ryan decided to expand his site to provide reviews on the latest electronics. To expand the Geeks Digest brand Ryan now is accepting applications to become an editor on the geeksdigest.com website as well as advertising opportunities too. With the site traffic and subscribers rapidly growing, the Geeks Digest is becoming more and more well-known to the technology community.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0014/2536/142536v2-max-150x150.png"],[[224,74],"assets/images/resized/0014/2536/142536v2-max-250x250.png"],[[224,74],"assets/images/resized/0014/2536/142536v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
