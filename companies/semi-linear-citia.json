We reorganize books onto virtual index cards. Each “idea card” lives in a 3D interface that lets readers explore new concepts. </p>\n\n<p>Citia’s cards free ebooks from paginated, linear constraints. Designed for the touchscreen, the app offers intuitive navigation and cards that can be emailed, tweeted, or posted to Facebook. </p>\n\n<p>Citia has partnerships with major publishers including Penguin, HarperCollins, Hachette, O’Reilly, and Perseus. </p>\n\n<p>“I started the company because our media haven’t evolved as quickly as our hardware — or our habits,” says Citia founder and CEO Linda Holliday. “Today’s ebooks are simply digitized versions of what’s been around since Gutenberg. This is the moment when reading can be truly reinvented for new devices — made smarter, more visual, more social, and more fun.”</p>\n\n<p>citia.com\n@GoCitia\nfacebook.com/gocitia</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,139],"assets/images/resized/0019/4919/194919v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,232],"assets/images/resized/0019/4919/194919v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,418],"assets/images/resized/0019/4919/194919v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO ","person":{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"Holliday","permalink":"linda-holliday","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"New York Office","address1":"1123 Broadway","address2":"Suite 700","zip_code":"10010","city":"NYC","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" src=\"http://live.wsj.com/public/page/embed-08266E29_0233_4097_9549_D4AA85692290.html\"></iframe>","description":"<p>Citia launches at All Things D</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0020/6435/206435v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0020/6435/206435v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,449],"assets/images/resized/0020/6435/206435v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[144,144],"assets/images/resized/0021/4426/214426v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,144],"assets/images/resized/0021/4426/214426v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,144],"assets/images/resized/0021/4426/214426v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://allthingsd.com/20120530/citia-lets-you-skip-the-boring-stuff-in-e-books-and-get-to-the-important-parts/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.idealog.com/blog/citia-apps-from-semi-linear-a-whole-new-way-to-present-high-concept-non-fiction/?doing_wp_cron=1338489671","title":""}]}
