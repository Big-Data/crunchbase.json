Originally only featuring iPhone developers, the site added in a second phase support for iPad, Google Android, Windows Mobile, Symbian, Blackberry and Palm developers.</p>\n\n<p>â€œPart of the TheyMakeApps vision is to help level the playing field,â€ explained Olivier Peyre, Kettle co-founder. â€œIt&#8217;s in everyone&#8217;s interest to spread the love, and facilitate the maturation of emerging mobile platforms such as Blackberry, Android, and Palm.  We hope TheyMakeApps helps illustrate how many great application developers there are outside of the iPhone community&#8211;enticing brands to explore this enormous untapped market.â€ </p>\n\n<p>Apps makers can quickly list their services at no cost, display visuals and upload examples of applications they have already built in a hip, user friendly format. The site also offers limited space on the home page for featured sponsorships: developers that choose to become a sponsor get more exposure and can showcase more apps.\nMarketers can peruse the site for free, filtering results by popularity, location, typical fee, newest listing, and most recently updated listings. Favorite apps makers can be short listed or shared on Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Launched in December 2009 the site has already attracted a hefty following. An estimated 900 developers participate, many of them gathering solid leads just days after creating a listing. SPIN Magazine used TheyMakeApps to find the perfect developer for their latest project.  </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;TheyMakeApps was a huge help with SPIN&#8217;s latest development project,â€ commented Nick Pandolfi, Digital Edition Manager, SPIN Media LLC. â€œRather then reach out to all our contacts for developer references, it was a quick way to find locally based developers and see exactly what they specialize in. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be using it again soon!&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>On April 4, 2010, TheyMakeApp won a Webby Award in the IT Hardware/Software category, and was also nominated in the Best Navigation/Structure category. The Webby Awards are the most prestigious Awards in the web industry, and fellow nominees include: twitter, HBO Imagine, Mashable, Hulu, TED,com, Mint.com, TheOnion, NYTimes, Tumblr&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>On March 14, 2010, Kettle won the SxSW Interactive Web Award in the business category for TheyMakeApps. For the last 13 years, SxSW has honored the top Web developers and designers worldwide.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/1025/81025v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/1025/81025v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/1025/81025v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"olivier","last_name":"PEYRE","permalink":"olivier-peyre-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7290/77290v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[221,232],"assets/images/resized/0007/7290/77290v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[221,232],"assets/images/resized/0007/7290/77290v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"tyler","last_name":"PETERSON","permalink":"tyler-peterson-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Won SXSW Web Award in Business Category","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/03/sxsw-web-awards/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Wired","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"TheyMakeApps","permalink":"theymakeapps"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
