Instead of providing business intelligence development tools, Insight, delivers pre-built, working anlaytics designed by business domain experts in manufacturing, operations, supply chain, sales and finance.  The analytics are hosted in the cloud and delivered using the Insight work bench that allows full customization of all of the delivered BI apps, as well as a robust ability to create dashboards and reports from scratch.  The product does all the hard work of extracting and translating complex data tables â€” like the ones in SAP â€” into everyday business terms that regular users can understand, with out going to IT for extra help. FusionOps also realized that the ability to easily share  business analytics makes them more valuable. Thatâ€™s why Insight includes social networking features like the kind found in Facebook, Twitter, and instant messaging. Combining visual analytics with social networking provides a powerful collaboration framework that is, by far, the fastest and most effective way to deliver results using business intelligence.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0001/7961/17961v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[216,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/7961/17961v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[216,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/7961/17961v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rich","last_name":"Nieset","permalink":"rich-nieset","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ram","last_name":"Mohan","permalink":"ram-mohan","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4.69M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":690000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":4,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"530 Lakeside Drive","address2":"Suite 150","zip_code":"94085","city":"Sunnyvale ","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.384206,"longitude":-121.992805}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0007/5154/75154v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,196],"assets/images/resized/0007/5154/75154v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,354],"assets/images/resized/0007/5154/75154v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sdcexec.com/publication/article.jsp?pubId=1&id=9672&pageNum=3","title":"Supply Chain Executive List 2007"}]}
