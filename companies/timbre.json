This has enormous value for independent musicians who rely heavily on sales of tickets and concert “stuff” (T-shirts, CDs, etc.) to fund themselves.  On the consumer side, this simple tool (with cool minimalist design) connects users to the local music scene and allows them to form new attachments, buy tickets and connect to the band via Facebook and Twitter.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/0722/210722v2-max-150x150.png"],[[213,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/0722/210722v2-max-250x250.png"],[[383,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/0722/210722v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Kasdorf","permalink":"mark-kasdorf","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Bridges","permalink":"matt-bridges-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Bandsintown","permalink":"bandsintown","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/0572/20572v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/0572/20572v8-max-250x250.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/0572/20572v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Livetapp","permalink":"livetapp","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Soundtracker","permalink":"soundtracker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/8519/68519v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/8519/68519v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,96],"assets/images/resized/0006/8519/68519v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"BandoftheDay","permalink":"bandoftheday","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Intrepid Labs","address1":"222 3rd Street","address2":"Suite 4000","zip_code":"024142","city":"Cambridge","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kBt4R8QEiro\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Timbre Demo Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4118/214118v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4118/214118v2-max-250x250.png"],[[253,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4118/214118v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4119/214119v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4119/214119v2-max-250x250.png"],[[253,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4119/214119v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4120/214120v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4120/214120v2-max-250x250.png"],[[253,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4120/214120v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4121/214121v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4121/214121v2-max-250x250.png"],[[253,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4121/214121v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/timbre-iphone-app-local-live-music-discovery/","title":"TechCrunch"},{"external_url":"http://articles.boston.com/2012-09-07/business/33680072_1_app-store-timbre-free-samples","title":"Boston Globe"},{"external_url":"http://www.soundctrl.com/blog/2012/09/13/checking-out-music-venues-before-you-check-in-timbre-app/","title":"SoundCtrl"},{"external_url":"http://evolver.fm/2012/09/10/timbre/","title":"Evolver.FM"},{"external_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/timbre-music-discovery-app-2012-9?op=1#ixzz26Nkug6cj","title":"Business Insider"},{"external_url":"http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2012/09/concert-finding_app_timbre_app.html","title":"Boston.com"}]}
