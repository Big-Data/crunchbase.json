While there are already &#8220;people search&#8221; sites and social news aggregators, Newsle does two things that haven&#8217;t been done before:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Finds real news about&#8211;not by&#8211;your Facebook friends and LinkedIn contacts (no tweets, no statuses, no &#8220;social noise&#8221;)</li>\n<li>Combines this with news about public figures you select, in a single newsfeed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve developed sophisticated algorithms to disambiguate between people with the same name, to evaluate the importance of news articles, and to optimize your newsfeed as you rate and interact with articles. You can adjust the amount of news you see about each person you&#8217;re following and sort your newsfeed by date or importance. This makes it a unique way to discover news that is relevant to you personally, but that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0011/7213/117213v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0011/7213/117213v2-max-250x250.png"],[[330,116],"assets/images/resized/0011/7213/117213v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"Varon","permalink":"jonah-varon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/2482/122482v4-max-150x150.png"],[[213,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/2482/122482v4-max-250x250.png"],[[242,284],"assets/images/resized/0012/2482/122482v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Axel","last_name":"Hansen","permalink":"axel-hansen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/9457/119457v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,207],"assets/images/resized/0011/9457/119457v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,207],"assets/images/resized/0011/9457/119457v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0011/7212/117212v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,180],"assets/images/resized/0011/7212/117212v2-max-250x250.png"],[[425,306],"assets/images/resized/0011/7212/117212v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/13/newsie/","title":"TechCrunch article on Newsle"}]}
