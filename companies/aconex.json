This was true even though projects generate thousands of documents and pieces of correspondence that need to be shared between hundreds of people, who are often geographically dispersed. </p>\n\n<p>Information management using paper documents, couriers, mail and fax was expensive, time consuming, and open to human error.</p>\n\n<p>Aconex was devised as a solution for online document management on construction projects â€“ a system which leverages the power of the internet to streamline communication and improve collaboration. Aconex was designed in cooperation with industry professionals to mirror standard industry practice, and an emphasis was placed on customer service and support, to ensure that users were quickly adept at using the system. </p>\n\n<p>Since then, Aconex has expanded to become the largest - and fastest-growing -provider of web collaboration technology to its target markets. Global uptake of the Aconex solution has doubled every year, as more and more organiszations become aware of the benefits of web-based collaboration. </p>\n\n<p>The company now services more than 5,500 projects across more than 65 countries, on landmark developments throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. </p>\n\n<p>The growth of Aconex can largely be attributed to a world-class solution, the highest standard of customer support, and the ability to service any project in the world, regardless of size or location. Aconex is an award-winning, privately owned organization, with a clear vision and a strong leadership team. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/2222/32222v1-max-150x150.png"],[[217,81],"assets/images/resized/0003/2222/32222v1-max-250x250.png"],[[217,81],"assets/images/resized/0003/2222/32222v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Aconex","permalink":"aconex","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Hosking","permalink":"martin-hosking","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Ezra","last_name":"Perlman","permalink":"ezra-perlman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$85M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2008/09/down_undas_acon.html","source_description":"Down Unda's Aconex Raises $85M For Construction Software","raised_amount":85000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":23,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Francisco Partners","permalink":"francisco-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,113],"assets/images/resized/0006/8442/68442v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[121,113],"assets/images/resized/0006/8442/68442v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[121,113],"assets/images/resized/0006/8442/68442v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"PA","address1":"405 Lexington Ave, Chrysler Building, ","address2":"25th Floor","zip_code":"10174","city":" New York City","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
