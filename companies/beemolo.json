Name, Address and Phone number (NAP) information is still the most critical search data sought by consumers.  The bottom line expectation of users is to be presented with complete and thorough listing information at any time they make a request.</p>\n\n<p>Problem we solve: Bad local businesses data propagates through most local mobile and web-based business listings.  We created an infrastructure to solve this along with mobile apps to serve it up. </p>\n\n<p>Beemolo is much more than mobile applications - an entire  web-accessible framework to support the upkeep of the data has been built on Microsoft .NET and SQL Server technology.  The framework was built for quick real-time support of data updating.</p>\n\n<p>The mobile opportunity for app developers is to make life easier for smartphone users as they navigate through the world. The Beemolo hyper-local platform allows businesses and organizations to &#8220;touch&#8221; local communities with the features they seek: direct linkage to social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc), location mapping, website connectivity, mobile display advertising, mobile coupons and more. </p>\n\n<p>The Beemolo App launch for Lawrence, Kansas includes more than 2,500 businesses and over 2,700 organizations. Business headings include Auto, Beauty, Fitness, Food, Health, Living, Retail and Services. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/6707/206707v2-max-150x150.png"],[[156,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/6707/206707v2-max-250x250.png"],[[156,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/6707/206707v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0020/6706/206706v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0020/6706/206706v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,269],"assets/images/resized/0020/6706/206706v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
