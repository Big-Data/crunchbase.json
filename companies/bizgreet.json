This powerful business intelligence allows BizGreet to offer unsurpassed CPA pricing, ensuring that clients only pay for success in delivering the message to the customer and the customer to the point-of-sale. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0009/4326/94326v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,125],"assets/images/resized/0009/4326/94326v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,125],"assets/images/resized/0009/4326/94326v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mat","last_name":"Harris","permalink":"mat-harris","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Peters","permalink":"mark-peters","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$345k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2010/feb/07/no-headline---businessnews/","source_description":"http://www.bizgreet.com/bizgreet-receives-245000-in-funding-from-three-texas-investment-groups/","raised_amount":345000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"8140 N Mopac Expy","address2":"Ste. 1-110","zip_code":"78759","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"BizGreet 2.0 Platform Release - BizGreet releases the next version of its platform for adaptive video, enabling personalized web video hosted anywhere.
