It enables consumers to easily “snip” content - videos, images, and articles - and share their opinions with the world.</p>\n\n<p>The site was founded in the spring of 2011 when Egypt-born, San Francisco-based Ramy Adeeb, then a principal at Khosla Ventures, was struggling to ﬁnd a platform to share his thoughts and relevant content around the Arab Spring. With that in mind, he created Snip.it, a platform focused on highlighting interests through collections, and a\nvenue for non-ﬂeeting content.</p>\n\n<p>Snip.it&#8217;s dedicated user base has generated hundreds of thousands of snips on thousands of global topics from Politics to Health, Sports and Film; current events such as SXSW; special interests such as Fashion and Yoga; and global developments such as the violence in Syria. Snip.it is ideal for today&#8217;s readers, thinkers and communicators who want to delve deeper into the topics that interest them.</p>\n\n<p>The site has been featured in several high proﬁle news outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, Mashable and AllThingsD. The company is funded by Khosla Ventures, True Ventures, Charles River Ventures, and SV Angel.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/2555/162555v2-max-150x150.png"],[[218,225],"assets/images/resized/0016/2555/162555v2-max-250x250.png"],[[218,225],"assets/images/resized/0016/2555/162555v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ramy","last_name":"Adeeb","permalink":"ramy-adeeb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/5098/205098v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/5098/205098v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/5098/205098v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"181 Fremont Street","address2":"","zip_code":"94105","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gcU0oWOeDOs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<div style='text-align:center'>\r\n\r\n<object width='430' height='265' id='FiveminPlayer' classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000'>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowfullscreen' value='true'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='movie' value='http://embed.5min.com/517404198/'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='wmode' value='opaque' />\r\n\r\n<embed name='FiveminPlayer' src='http://embed.5min.com/517404198/' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='430' height='265' allowfullscreen='true' allowScriptAccess='always' wmode='opaque'>\r\n\r\n</embed>\r\n\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n</div>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/snip-it-revamp-analytics-new-features/","title":"Hands-On With The Newly Revamped Snip.it: Where Pinterest Meets News, And So Much More"},{"external_url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/06/27/snip-its-interest-network-aims-to- ﬁlter-out-the-noise/","title":"Snip.it's Interest Network Aims To Filter Out The Noise"},{"external_url":"http://pandodaily.com/2012/06/26/khosla-backed-snip-it-launches-a-complete-redesign/","title":"Khosla-Backed Snip.it Launches a Complete Redesign"},{"external_url":"http://vator.tv/news/2012-06-26-snipit-the-pinterest-for-brain-candy-revamps-site","title":"Snip.it, the Pinterest for brain candy, revamps site"},{"external_url":"http://betakit.com/2012/06/27/snip-it-overhauls-aims-to-be-a-pinterest-for-in-depth- content","title":"Snip.it Overhauls, Aims to be a Pinterest for In-Depth Content"}]}
