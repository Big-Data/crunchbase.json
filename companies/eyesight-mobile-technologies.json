Mobile phones, TVs, tablets, netbooks, set up boxes, all-in-ones, navigation systems, digital signage and more, can now be control with a wave of a hand.</p>\n\n<p>The technology:\neyeSightâ€˜s Touch Free User Interface utilizes the deviceâ€™s camera, along with advanced real-time image processing and machine vision algorithms, to track the user&#8217;s hand gestures and convert them into commands.\nThe technology is independent of the underlying processor and camera hardware, highly optimized in a manner of CPU and Power Consumption, and produces high quality gesture recognitions.</p>\n\n<p>for more information visit: www.eyeSight-tech.com </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0015/9631/159631v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0015/9631/159631v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,113],"assets/images/resized/0015/9631/159631v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"Shmuel","permalink":"gideon-shmuel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Itay","last_name":"Katz","permalink":"itay-katz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/11/eyesight-mobile-technologies-completes-4-2m-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"eyeSight Mobile Technologies Completes $4.2M Series B Funding Round","raised_amount":4200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":22,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"CEVA","permalink":"ceva","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0016/3641/163641v1-max-150x150.png"],[[152,81],"assets/images/resized/0016/3641/163641v1-max-250x250.png"],[[152,81],"assets/images/resized/0016/3641/163641v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mitsui Global Investment","permalink":"mitsui-global-investment","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"16 Abba Eban blvd.","address2":"","zip_code":"46725","city":"Hertzelia","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Pantech licensed eyeSight's gesture technology to intigrate in their upcoming smartphones.\r\nPantech Vega LTE launched with eyeSight's technology inside.","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://gizmodo.com/5855256/pantechs-gesture-recognizing-vega-lte-will-do-more-than-smile-when-you-wave-at-it/gallery/1","source_text":null,"source_description":"In the press","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"eyeSight Mobile Technologies","permalink":"eyesight-mobile-technologies"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0015/9628/159628v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0015/9628/159628v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,312],"assets/images/resized/0015/9628/159628v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[141,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/9629/159629v2-max-150x150.png"],[[236,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/9629/159629v2-max-250x250.png"],[[369,390],"assets/images/resized/0015/9629/159629v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0015/9630/159630v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,213],"assets/images/resized/0015/9630/159630v2-max-250x250.png"],[[434,371],"assets/images/resized/0015/9630/159630v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0016/4271/164271v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,161],"assets/images/resized/0016/4271/164271v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,291],"assets/images/resized/0016/4271/164271v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0016/4273/164273v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,161],"assets/images/resized/0016/4273/164273v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,291],"assets/images/resized/0016/4273/164273v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
