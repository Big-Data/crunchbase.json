For $9.95 per month and 30 minutes each quarter, anyone can build and manage their own ETF portfolio and grow their money like the world&#8217;s smartest investors.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional wisdom suggests that being successful in the stock market is about picking the right stocks or hiring the right financial advisor to manage one&#8217;s money.  Study after study proves, though, that it&#8217;s not possible to &#8220;beat the market&#8221; with any consistency, and that the most successful investors ride the market by allocating their assets across broad sections of the market and re-balancing when their asset allocations get out of whack. </p>\n\n<p>While mutual funds purport to do this sort of thing, they typically charge investors 2% or more off the top, whether they&#8217;re making money or not, and have tax implications that are often unfriendly to investors.  Over time, these taxes and fees can erode 30-50% of an average portfolio!</p>\n\n<p>E.Adviser allows investors to take control of their own money in a three step process as follows: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>User inputs data points such as age and risk tolerance, and based on those factors, MarketRiders suggests a portfolio based on ETFs (low-fee index funds typically associated with buckets of stocks or commodities).  User can customize the portfolio or copy a successful portfolio from another MarketRiders user.</p></li>\n<li><p>MarketRiders sends user a lists of trades to make at his or her online broker. Once user confirms purchases and prices, MarketRiders begins monitoring user&#8217;s account for necessary changes based on rules and alerts that user can configure. </p></li>\n<li><p>MarketRiders watches each user portfolio and alerts user when he or she needs to make changes.  If for example, a user wants to maintain 10% in coal, and coal makes a run such that 15% of the user&#8217;s portfolio is now in coal, MarketRiders suggests the necessary trades to bring the portfolio back to the desired asset allocation.  </p></li>\n</ol>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0003/0735/30735v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/0735/30735v4-max-250x250.png"],[[273,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/0735/30735v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO and co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Pfenninger","permalink":"ryan-pfenninger","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and founder","person":{"first_name":"Mitch","last_name":"Tuchman","permalink":"mitch-tuchman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Beck","permalink":"stephen-beck","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$200k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":15,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Mitch","last_name":"Tuchman","permalink":"mitch-tuchman","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"530 Lytton Ave","address2":"2nd Floor","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.8097439,"longitude":-121.9909454}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0012/4179/124179v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0012/4179/124179v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,339],"assets/images/resized/0012/4179/124179v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/marketriders-commission-free-e-t-f-portfolios/","title":"MarketRiders Offering Commission-Free E.T.F.
