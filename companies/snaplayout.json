Tired of a lack of innovation from MySpace&#8217;s end, the Weebly guys created a simple profile editor to help the millions of users looking to better customize their personal page.</p>\n\n<p>The SnapLayout editor is pretty easy to use.  MySpace users log in to SnapLayout with their MySpace credentials and use a &#8220;what you see is what you get&#8221; (WYSIWYG) editor to rearrange the major features of their page.  Users can use an array of SnapLayout&#8217;s templates or drag and drop sections of their page wherever they&#8217;d like.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/flickr\" title=\"Flickr\">Flickr</a> photos can be used as backdrops, text size, style and color can be changed.  SnapLayout even lets you place your uploaded photos in a slide show.  It also has a widget platform which will include apps created by the company.  The first is a virtual gift widget which mimics the very popular <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> feature.</p>\n\n<p>SnapLayout offers an addition to Myspace that will be popular with its users.  We&#8217;ll see how MySpace reacts if SnapLayout gains traction.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0006/2097/62097v18-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0006/2097/62097v18-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0006/2097/62097v18-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SnapLayout","permalink":"snaplayout","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Veltri","permalink":"dan-veltri","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Rusenko","permalink":"david-rusenko","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Fanini","permalink":"chris-fanini","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$650k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/weebly","source_description":null,"raised_amount":650000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Baseline Ventures","permalink":"baseline-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0013/5134/135134v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0013/5134/135134v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,272],"assets/images/resized/0013/5134/135134v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.775196,"longitude":-122.419204}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[93,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/0411/70411v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[155,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/0411/70411v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[280,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/0411/70411v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
