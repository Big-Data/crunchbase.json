We use paper to share, work and collaborate. In effect, in the world where most of our work happens online, the results of the design phase are left in the analog world, disconnected, not shareable, and easily forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>With Substance, you can finally, using your smartphone, transfer your hand drawn sketches into editable interactive models.
