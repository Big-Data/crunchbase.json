Barring a handful of major Brands, most other Brands face challenges in getting their Gift Cards to the right &#8216;pockets of demand&#8217;. This is the major bottleneck in taking this industry to its next level of growth.\nWe have launched several channels of sale targeting specific &#8216;pockets of demand&#8217; for Gifts &amp; Incentives - at an individual as well as corporate level. Effectively, we act as a single-point solution for Gift Voucher (pre-paid cards) based Gifting &amp; Incentive needs.\nOur target customers range from upwardly mobile Indians &amp; NRIs gifting to India to companies incentivizing their employees, sales channel, customers &amp; business associates.\nSome of our channels of sale include \n1) E-commerce website www.thegiftopia.com\n2) Hosted Corporate Incentive Program (HCIP) - a Gift Voucher based hosted, extremely scalable, customizable, pan-India tool for employee incentives (www.thegiftopia.com/HCIP)\netc&#8230;.\nWe&#8217;ve launched in Sept-end 2011 &amp; are a small but highly efficient team.</p>\n\n<p>About me: I am the founder &amp; CEO of Ubiquity Consumer Technologies Pvt Ltd, that has launched The Giftopia platform. Before founding the company in 2011, I&#8217;ve worked with Intel Corp in Phoenix, US, for 5.5 years. I completed my MS at Univ of Southern California, Los Angeles.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0017/0706/170706v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0017/0706/170706v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0017/0706/170706v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Paritosh","last_name":"Likhote","permalink":"paritosh-likhote","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"www.giftbig.com","permalink":"www-giftbig-com","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Khar West","address2":"","zip_code":"400052","city":"Mumbai","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
