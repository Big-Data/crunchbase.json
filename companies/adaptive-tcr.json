T-cell receptor profiling using Adaptiveâ€™s proprietary technology and software allows scientists to study the adaptive immune system to an unprecedented depth via high-throughput T-Cell Receptor (TCR) sequencing. Adaptive provides T-cell receptor profiling as a service to the research community.</p>\n\n<p>The Adaptive team is developing a myriad of applications based on this technology, such as the study of immune system reconstitution post-bone marrow transplantation and the efficacy of vaccines in development. Adaptive is pioneering work using this technology to discover diagnostics in immune system disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Type I Diabetes.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0008/2022/82022v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0008/2022/82022v1-max-250x250.png"],[[380,113],"assets/images/resized/0008/2022/82022v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Chad","last_name":"Robins","permalink":"chad-robins","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"Andriesen","permalink":"jessica-andriesen","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10.4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/adaptive-tcr-grabs-4-5m-funding/2010-03-26?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss","source_description":"Adaptive TCR grabs $4.5M in funding","raised_amount":4550000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":26,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/06/adaptive-tcr-completes-5-8m-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Adaptive TCR Completes $5.8M Series B Funding","raised_amount":5800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":10,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"307 Westlake Ave N","address2":"Suite 300 ","zip_code":"98109","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
