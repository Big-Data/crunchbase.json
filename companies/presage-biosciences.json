The Presage clinical surrogate approach enables drug companies to halt development projects for compounds that show no efficacy in the native tumor microenvironment. In addition, the Presage approach can identify drug targets using RNA interference without concern regarding localization or distribution of systemically administered RNAi agents. Presage technology can also be used to identify effective drug combinations in ways that more directly measure the efficacy of such combinations than otherwise possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,60],"assets/images/resized/0012/0951/120951v2-max-150x150.png"],[[136,60],"assets/images/resized/0012/0951/120951v2-max-250x250.png"],[[136,60],"assets/images/resized/0012/0951/120951v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$4M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.presagebio.com/history.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Wu","permalink":"david-wu-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0011/6787/116787v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,169],"assets/images/resized/0011/6787/116787v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,169],"assets/images/resized/0011/6787/116787v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.presagebio.com/releases/Presage_PR_06232010.pdf","source_description":"","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
