Then apply algorithms based on computational linguistics and Bayesian methodology, allowing us to cull the data, filtered by category, contributor and source, identify the most relevant trending conversations, and provide the foresight needed to engage people in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>But it takes action to influence.  Blabâ€™s real time marketing platform creates, produces and publishes branded content across all digital channels contextualized by the relevant trending conversations within 24 hours, making you a participant and an influencer in the trending conversation, not just an eavesdropper.
