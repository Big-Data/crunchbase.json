Our mission is to provide the most robust white-label solution and business opportunity for the digital publishing of the local restaurant industry.</p>\n\n<p>Previous to OrderUp, the founders were co-founders in another company in a similar space.  In this previous company, the founders learned the product and local business model, but believed in licensing the product to local entrepreneurs and media companies rather than expand horizontally through the traditional top-down¬ù approach. The belief in local content management, sales and marketing efforts executed by a vested local entity, combined with a robust software offering and support infrastructure, is the foundation of OrderUp.</p>\n\n<p>Today, more than 25 local restaurant guides are powered by OrderUp and this is just scratching the surface. OrderUp is constantly growing horizontally into new markets and vertically in existing markets by developing new local sales and marketing strategies and technologies to enable the OrderUp licensee.
