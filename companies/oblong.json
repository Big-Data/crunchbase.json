Oblong’s technology has roots in more than two decades of research at the MIT Media Lab and was the direct basis for the computers depicted in the film “Minority Report”. The company, founded in 2006, maintains global headquarters in Los Angeles, CA.</p>\n\n<p>The g-speak™ Spatial Operating Environment (SOE) is Oblong’s application development and deployment platform. It&#8217;s the only general purpose platform designed from the ground up to give programmers access to the principles of spatial (and gestural) computing and real-world pixels, and to enable applications that are inherently multi-screen, multi-user, and multi-device. Oblong has used g-speak to help Global Fortune 500 companies like Boeing, Saudi Aramco, and GE (as well as government agencies and universities) build and deploy profoundly productive solutions in areas including modeling and simulation, logistics and supply chain management, natural resource discovery and extraction, energy grid management, and financial and scientific data navigation and visualization.</p>\n\n<p>Oblong’s Mezzanine™ product, built atop the g-speak platform, is a meeting- and conference-room system that offers a unique shared pixel collaboration space: multiple participants work across multiple screens, sharing data, live video, and applications &#8211; and exercising collaborative control &#8211; from every device (phones, tablets, laptop browsers) they bring with them into the room. Telepresence capabilities, collaborative whiteboarding, and presentation design and delivery are integrated into the Mezzanine experience. Each Mezzanine room can join up to three other Mezzanine rooms (or connect to standard telepresence / videoconference endpoints) to enable distance collaboration of unprecedented immediacy and fluidity.</p>\n\n<p>The Oblong team comprises former executives, developers, and engineers from (among others) Apple, Google, Pixar, Microsoft, Accenture, and Walt Disney Imagineering. Oblong is privately held; investors include The Foundry Group, Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, and Energy Technology Ventures.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0007/5664/75664v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0007/5664/75664v3-max-250x250.png"],[[256,128],"assets/images/resized/0007/5664/75664v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientist & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Underkoffler","permalink":"john-underkoffler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[92,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/7785/207785v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[154,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/7785/207785v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[277,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/7785/207785v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Kwindla","last_name":"Kramer","permalink":"kwindla-kramer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0020/7784/207784v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0020/7784/207784v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0020/7784/207784v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Feld","permalink":"brad-feld","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/2127/12127v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,151],"assets/images/resized/0001/2127/12127v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,151],"assets/images/resized/0001/2127/12127v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"Ann de Lares Norris","permalink":"mary-ann-de-lares-norris","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Mendelson","permalink":"jason-mendelson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/6427/56427v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,151],"assets/images/resized/0005/6427/56427v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,151],"assets/images/resized/0005/6427/56427v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"McIntyre","permalink":"ryan-mcintyre","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/5439/55439v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/5439/55439v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/5439/55439v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$8.8M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":8800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Foundry Group","permalink":"foundry-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[164,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[164,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/2511/22511v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"David G.","last_name":"Cohen","permalink":"david-cohen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9993/29993v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/9993/29993v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[341,396],"assets/images/resized/0002/9993/29993v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David G.
