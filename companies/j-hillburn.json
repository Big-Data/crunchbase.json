Hilburn offers custom-made men&#8217;s shirts and clothing at a fraction of what the same shirt would cost at a traditional retailer.  The company sources its own fabric and cuts out the retail middleman, acting as a direct-to-consumer manufacturer.  </p>\n\n<p>Personal style advisors act as its salesforce, visiting each customer in his home or office, measuring them, and offering a high-end shopping experience.  Customers can also shop via the Web and an iPhone app.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,94],"assets/images/resized/0012/7357/127357v1-max-150x150.png"],[[121,94],"assets/images/resized/0012/7357/127357v1-max-250x250.png"],[[121,94],"assets/images/resized/0012/7357/127357v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Hil","last_name":"Davis","permalink":"hil-davis-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & President","person":{"first_name":"Veeral","last_name":"Rathod","permalink":"veeral-rathod-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$12.3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/23/three-years-after-launch-mens-custom-clothier-j-hilburn-discovers-e-commerce/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/23/three-years-after-launch-mens-custom-clothier-j-hilburn-discovers-e-commerce/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":3250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/23/three-years-after-launch-mens-custom-clothier-j-hilburn-discovers-e-commerce/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/j-hilburn-5-million-suits/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":9,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Bridgescale Partners","permalink":"bridgescale-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3033/23033v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/3033/23033v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[273,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/3033/23033v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Battery Ventures","permalink":"battery-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,95],"assets/images/resized/0000/3520/3520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"2601 W.
