With multiple profile support, great productivity apps out of the box and complete personal and IT cloud management, Divide is the next generation solution for enterprise mobility.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to compromise your personal freedom just because you want to do work on your handheld. Divide allows you to create an independent business profile on your Android phone so you can enjoy all the benefits of the Android platform while still having a fully managed and secure environment for business.  And Divide technology lets you switch instantly from one profile to another with the touch of a button.</p>\n\n<p>Divide provides you with a full-featured set of native-Android office applications out of the box. Check mail in a threaded conversation view and perform searches both on the device and on your mail server. Keep your Tasks, Contacts and Calendar fully synced both over 3G and on WiFi. And because all apps run in the separate Enterproid work environment, everything you do is fully encrypted and compliant with your company&#8217;s policies.</p>\n\n<p>All applications running in your work profile can take advantage of the enhanced security of the Enterproid platform. Full on-flash encryption safeguards your data and unlike with the native Email, Contacts and Calendar applications, no app you download from the Android Market can ever read your data. In addition, Enterproid technology guarantees that your personal browsing and app data will be kept private from your company. Work in full confidence knowing that nothing you do on your device can compromise your professional life.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0012/4585/124585v6-max-150x150.png"],[[221,56],"assets/images/resized/0012/4585/124585v6-max-250x250.png"],[[221,56],"assets/images/resized/0012/4585/124585v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Divide","permalink":"divide","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0018/8253/188253v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/8253/188253v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,115],"assets/images/resized/0018/8253/188253v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO
