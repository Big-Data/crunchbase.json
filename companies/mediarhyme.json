How???</p>\n\n<p>When you go and search for anything (song, video, torrentâ€¦) for example you want to search for a song for the Beatles you go to Google or any search engine and input the name of your song ; links come up and , to download the song you should click all of these links and search for the song you want , thus taking time and energy ; and maybe in the end finding a different song that contains a virus â€¦\nWhat MediaRhyme does is that it scans these links to provide the users with the best and most resumable link found.</p>\n\n<p>MediaRhyme&#8217;s search technology produces search results that reference media content and content information located worldwide throughout the Internet.
