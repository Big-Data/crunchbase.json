Their emphasis is on style, enjoying life and inclusion. It is a guide where, founder Fiona Jarvis says &#8216;style and disability are not mutually exclusive; you can have both&#8217;.</p>\n\n<p>They are the only such guide that has an emphasis on style and as such tap into the &#8216;disability&#8217; market which currently has an annual spend of £80bn. Their reach is at present greater than any of their competitors.</p>\n\n<p>They have a unique rating system for venues and equipment which is an accreditation of a maximum of 3 BBS Ticks. Similar to a Michelin Star.</p>\n\n<p>They also provide &#8216;access audit services&#8217; for venues that wish to improve their &#8216;less able&#8217; facilities and attain the maximum 3 BBS Ticks. Aswell as a concierge service for BBS users.</p>\n\n<p>Currently covering London, they are looking for further investment to expand their reach to the whole of the UK and Europe. In addition they would like to further develop their Mobile App. It is currently available on iPhone, iPad, Android and Blackberry and was jointly developed with UCL and Stuxbot. The app finds B BS accredited venues near your location and identifies if they are accessible and have disabled facilities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0021/0450/210450v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0021/0450/210450v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,221],"assets/images/resized/0021/0450/210450v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Chairman","person":{"first_name":"fiona","last_name":"jarvis","permalink":"fiona-jarvis-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"langford","permalink":"amanda-langford-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"PR Director","person":{"first_name":"Kate","last_name":"Warwick","permalink":"kate-warwick","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Disabled Go","permalink":"disabled-go","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Inclusion London","permalink":"inclusion-london","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Accountant","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"M. paget","permalink":"m-paget","image":null}},{"title":"PR","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"PR Savvy","permalink":"pr-savvy","image":null}},{"title":"Marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"SocialMediaStrategist","permalink":"socialmediastrategist","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"£40k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":40000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":8,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"Langford","permalink":"amanda-langford","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Fiona","last_name":"Jarvis","permalink":"fiona-jarvis","image":null}},{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Mounsey","permalink":"paul-mounsey","image":null}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YsJaqdo23D8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Mobile app tutorial</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/0449/210449v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/0449/210449v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/0449/210449v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/09/05/blue-badge-style-launches-app-cool-venue-spotting-accessibility/","title":"TheNewWeb press article"}]}
