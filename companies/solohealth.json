The award-winning company&#8217;s first offering was the EyeSiteÂ® vision kiosk, currently located in numerous retail outlets across America. In summer 2010, the company received a $1.2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to help enable innovation for the next-generation health and wellness platforms for healthcare and prevention. The company&#8217;s bilingual kiosks provide free health screenings and recommendations for follow-up care, as well as health and wellness information, which leads to prevention and lower healthcare costs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0012/7168/127168v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,97],"assets/images/resized/0012/7168/127168v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,97],"assets/images/resized/0012/7168/127168v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder ","person":{"first_name":"Bart","last_name":"Foster","permalink":"bart-foster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/7220/127220v1-max-150x150.png"],[[151,184],"assets/images/resized/0012/7220/127220v1-max-250x250.png"],[[151,184],"assets/images/resized/0012/7220/127220v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Sales and Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Sommer","permalink":"tony-sommer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/7222/127222v1-max-150x150.png"],[[151,184],"assets/images/resized/0012/7222/127222v1-max-250x250.png"],[[151,184],"assets/images/resized/0012/7222/127222v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Kendig","permalink":"stephen-kendig","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/7221/127221v1-max-150x150.png"],[[151,184],"assets/images/resized/0012/7221/127221v1-max-250x250.png"],[[151,184],"assets/images/resized/0012/7221/127221v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$8.2M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=PR&Date=20110321&ID=13194191&topic=TOPIC_FINANCING&isub=1","source_description":"Coinstar to Invest in SoloHealth","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":21,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Coinstar","permalink":"coinstar","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,56],"assets/images/resized/0011/5218/115218v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[145,56],"assets/images/resized/0011/5218/115218v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[145,56],"assets/images/resized/0011/5218/115218v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/10/solohealth-closes-8-2m-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"SoloHealth Closes $8.2M Funding Round","raised_amount":8200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":21,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"11555 Medlock Bridge","address2":"Suite 190","zip_code":"30097","city":"Duluth","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0012/7218/127218v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,226],"assets/images/resized/0012/7218/127218v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,408],"assets/images/resized/0012/7218/127218v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
