It then supports a quick drag and drop experience to organize these information snippets into community-created project templates (predefined file folders specific to an activity, like planning a trip).  These projects are then easily published or shared.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to allow information capture without forcing a user to change context and leave the experience they are engaged with, and then support automated and manual classification and organization of the information when it is appropriate, a bit like the weekly photo tagging activity of Facebook users.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0005/5289/55289v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0005/5289/55289v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0005/5289/55289v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Ho","permalink":"josh-ho","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Newcome","permalink":"dan-newcome","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.launchboxdigital.com/portfolio/launchbox09-portfolio/","source_description":"LaunchBox 09 Portfolio","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"LaunchBox Digital","permalink":"launchbox-digital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/9357/29357v1-max-150x150.png"],[[229,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/9357/29357v1-max-250x250.png"],[[229,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/9357/29357v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"225\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5939921&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5939921&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></embed></object><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5939921\">KeepFu</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user2126282\">Eleven Prime</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Screencast</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
