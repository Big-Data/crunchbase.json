Current business information providers&#8217; models focus on easy-to-obtain data - but do not allow for the extraction of important data locked into siloed corporate and governmental datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Arachnys uses domain expertise from the security and investigative industry alongside innovative spidering and scraping technology to identify high-value information buried in the deep web and make it searchable and accessible to businesses - investment banks, hedge funds, law firms, accountants and risk consultancies - who are increasingly looking to emerging markets for growth. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0014/6159/146159v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0014/6159/146159v2-max-250x250.png"],[[280,63],"assets/images/resized/0014/6159/146159v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/11/arachnys-raises-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Arachnys Raises Series A Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":28,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"ideaSpace","address2":"3 Charles Babbage Road","zip_code":"CB3 0GT","city":"Cambridge","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
