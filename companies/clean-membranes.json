These membranes are inherently anti-fouling and exhibit higher water flow, dramatically improving filter performance and long-term operating life.<br/>\nPotential applications include municipal, wastewater, oil and gas, pharmaceutical and food industry produced waters, seawater desalination, as well as producing potable water from brackish water and many more purification applications. \nThe combination of higher membrane permeability and exceptional fouling resistance results in significantly lower manufacturing and operating costs than existing membrane technology.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0011/8530/118530v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0011/8530/118530v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,73],"assets/images/resized/0011/8530/118530v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/01/clean-membranes-closes-series-financing.html","source_description":"Clean Membranes Closes Series A Financing Round","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":22,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Morningside Venture Investments","permalink":"morningside-venture-investments","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
