They video would then play at that pace to emulate the pace which the treadmill operates. These videos will work with any DVD player and any treadmill.</p>\n\n<p>Virtual Runner brings the experience one step further. The user attaches a small footpod to their shoelace which communicates with a wireless receiver connected to the user&#8217;s laptop, PC or iPad. An optional heart rate monitor can also be displayed if worn. The footpod transmits the runner&#8217;s pace to the wireless receiver which in turn controls the pace of the video through Virtual Runner. If the user runs faster, the video speeds up. If the video slows down or stops, the video responds accordingly and accurately. An on screen dashboard can be enabled to show the overall time, distance run, average pace, heart rate and cadence. </p>\n\n<p>All videos are shot in HD from a runner&#8217;s point of view. Videos include famous race courses, popular running routes and scenic destinations. Distances range from a 5K all the way up to a full marathon. Optional starting points and a save feature allow the viewer to spread a videoout over several days or workouts.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0016/2806/162806v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0016/2806/162806v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,355],"assets/images/resized/0016/2806/162806v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
