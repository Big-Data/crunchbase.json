This tool creates a commodity marketplace to address the fragmented and high risk needs of content owners and distributors (networks, syndicators) and their currency clients (advertisers, viewers).</p>\n\n<p>Our flagship product, Debuit.com, creates a front and back end content delivery platform, which delivers original programming to a mass audience, and then measures audience viewership and participation down to the individual viewer.</p>\n\n<p>Our clients critically require a better way to predict the success of their content and advertising investments. There is currently no standard currency for online measurement that is adequate to meet the needs of media planners, networks and content owners. Our business reduces the financial risk for our clients, and provides them with critical insight to make multi-billion dollar decisions more effectively.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0017/2290/172290v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,107],"assets/images/resized/0017/2290/172290v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,192],"assets/images/resized/0017/2290/172290v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"Valenti","permalink":"jennifer-valenti","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/2289/172289v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/2289/172289v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/2289/172289v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"Valenti","permalink":"jennifer-valenti","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/2289/172289v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/2289/172289v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/2289/172289v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO/COO","person":{"first_name":"Jarrett","last_name":"Goetz","permalink":"jarrett-goetz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/5283/135283v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/5283/135283v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/5283/135283v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
