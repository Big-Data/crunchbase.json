Dan recently founded and funded Avalon Integration, a systems integrator focused on SAP R/3.  Profitable in Y1, Avalon had revenue of $3mm in Y3. Before that, as CTO, Dan helped to grow Applied Tactical Systems, an enterprise software firm, from $6MM to $10MM in 3 years and a $26MM exit. </p>\n\n<p>Charlie Oâ€™Flaherty is a proven leader with a track record for identifying new markets and business opportunities then recruiting and leading top executive teams to execute category-dominating business plans.  His 18 years of experience in Asia, UK and the US include building and running HSBC Securities USA (APAC); founding AsiAlliance, Asiaâ€™s first financial technology VC incubator, and selling it to Dublin-based Digital Channel Partners; purchasing Lonrhoâ€™s Index Air Cargo and repositioning it as the IFRCâ€™s primary East African logistics partner; and restructuring ABN AMROâ€™s US equity derivatives business by bringing manufacturing and distribution in-house to yield Y1 sales of more than $2 billion. As a hands-on operator, he looks forward to building EverythingTree from a disruptive startup to the category-defining solution for lead capture &amp; broadcast shopping.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Market Opportunities:</strong>\nConsumers typically find providers by â€œcalling around.&#8221;  This is a time consuming and inefficient search strategy. </p>\n\n<p>Service Providers typically generate leads via advertising or purchase them from lead-capture sites.  This is often expensive and ineffective.  </p>\n\n<p>We solve the &#8220;matching&#8221; problem above, at no cost to the provider or consumer.</p>\n\n<p>We disrupt the leads-for-sale (ServiceMagic &amp; Redbeacon) models by providing our leads for free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Target Markets:</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>PROVIDERS:</strong> Other lead capture sites target specific vertical markets (ServiceMagic targets contractors; SitterCity targets babysitters, etc.) Our market includes ALL service businesses (contractors, lawyers, doctors, car services, nannies etc.). Many are already paying for leads through ServiceMagic, etc.  We now have 87 service providers including 3 national franchises.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONSUMERS</strong> don&#8217;t pay at EverythingTree.  The potential market is essentially the craigslist user base which is to say, consumers of most any service, anywhere in the US.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competitors:</strong>\nThere are many in the lead capture space, including: ServiceMagic, RedBeacon, ProspectVista, LendingTree, etc.  But EverythingTree is DISRUPTIVE: we are the only one attempting to monetize this space in this fashion. Our revenue model is similar to craigslist which is free to nearly everyone, nearly everywhere, but still has revenues of more than $100M with only 38 employees.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong>\nIt is difficult to compete on a traditional basis with an offering that is free for nearly every user, nearly everywhere, nearly all the time.  Our early experience has shown that the EverythingTree model is intuitively pleasing for both service providers and consumers and while marketing is definitely necessary to get our message out, we are very confident about the sales conversion rate we will achieve.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,109],"assets/images/resized/0007/9327/79327v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[101,109],"assets/images/resized/0007/9327/79327v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[101,109],"assets/images/resized/0007/9327/79327v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Charlie","last_name":"O'Flaherty","permalink":"charlie-oflaherty","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/1991/91991v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/1991/91991v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/1991/91991v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"McCabe","permalink":"dan-mccabe","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ServiceMagic","permalink":"servicemagic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/9468/29468v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/9468/29468v3-max-250x250.png"],[[304,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/9468/29468v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Redbeacon","permalink":"redbeacon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0005/8347/58347v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0005/8347/58347v4-max-250x250.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0005/8347/58347v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Craigslist","permalink":"craigslist","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-150x150.png"],[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-250x250.png"],[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Fort Lauderdale","address1":"1314 East Las Olas Blvd","address2":"Suite 123","zip_code":"33301","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0007/9326/79326v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0007/9326/79326v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,444],"assets/images/resized/0007/9326/79326v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,119],"assets/images/resized/0009/2010/92010v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,198],"assets/images/resized/0009/2010/92010v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,358],"assets/images/resized/0009/2010/92010v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
