This doesn&#8217;t limit mileage or impose curfews; instead it assesses individual driving behaviour. Insurance premiums are reviewed every 3 months with the aim of reducing the cost of car insurance for better drivers. Customers get feedback via the ingenie mobile app and website to help them develop their skills.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0016/3176/163176v2-max-150x150.png"],[[207,102],"assets/images/resized/0016/3176/163176v2-max-250x250.png"],[[207,102],"assets/images/resized/0016/3176/163176v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"King","permalink":"richard-king-4","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Dorset House, Regent Park","address2":"297 Kingston Road","zip_code":"KT22 7PL","city":"Leatherhead","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/11/sensor_box_insurance/","title":"The Register article"}]}
