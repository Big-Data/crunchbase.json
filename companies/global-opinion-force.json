You communicate your stand on the issues to local, national, and global policy makers.</p>\n\n<p>What can you do?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do you have a burning issue or concern? Submit it.\n2.Vote “for” or “against” and explain why (if you choose)\n3.Invite your friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens—the more the\nmerrier. Besides—greater participation raises your issue to the top of the agenda.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why participate?</p>\n\n<p>Voting is the next step beyond petitioning (and having others vote on your behalf). The internet is a great information, access, and organizing tool.\nLet’s use it to discuss, deliberate, and make our voices count. Together we’ll share and promote views from the ground level. When we own our ideas we’re more inclined to get off our comfy chairs and do something about it in real time.</p>\n\n<p>Is it free?</p>\n\n<p>You betcha. We want everyone to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Our core principles.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Non-partisan</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is no agenda from the left or right (or anything in between). All opinions are welcome as long as they are respectful of human dignity and diversity. We do reserve the right to flag content that is disrespectful, a violation of human rights, or just plain old spam.</p>\n\n<p>We don’t take stands or prioritize issues. We only deliver a live platform that allows all citizens to evoke their point of view and measure its popularity by quantifiable methods.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Transparency</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>GOF cannot hide or reserve information about our participants. We will only reserve as private the personal information and activity at the behest of the contributor. The ability to vote is sacred.\nWe have an ongoing commitment to investigate and constantly develop new ways to verify and authenticate the content, votes and contributors on our platform.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Human rights are civil rights.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We will not accept content that discriminates on the basis of race, class, sex, ethnicity, politicl affiliation, or sexual orientation. Content that represents a violation of Human Rights or contravenes our intent to provide a conduit for open and democratic exchange of ideas will be removed.</p>\n\n<p>We are developing new tools that will allow our users to determine if flagged content should be removed by vote. Let us know about your point of view by contacting us at info@gof.do</p>\n\n<p>Team</p>\n\n<p>We are a dedicated, perspicacious, and small group of engineers,designers and entrepreneurs living in Palo Alto, CA.
