Lavva lets people observe, understand, socialize and collaborate</p>\n\n<p>The LAVVA team has developed a search engine that will change the way the world surfs the net! We&#8217;ve created a unique algorithm that works organically on the user level and adds the missing human element to browsing, transforming search from a pattern of keywords into a personalized social environment. Hence our motto, Go Social!</p>\n\n<p>LAVVA has improved the way you retrieve information, empowering users with the ultimate information exchange and communication platform. We treat each search query as a unique request, producing top results based on users&#8217; experiences, with an additional opportunity, if desired, to interact with others with the same immediate interests. That&#8217;s where LAVVA excels, at this experienced based search model.</p>\n\n<p>Our vision is to create a socially driven and collaborative search engine where people can share their experiences and create a unique, democratic platform based on a currency of collective intelligence and experience. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/6141/66141v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0006/6141/66141v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[364,92],"assets/images/resized/0006/6141/66141v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"Rostom","permalink":"mohamed-rostom","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Public Relations and Social Community Manager","person":{"first_name":"Lindsay","last_name":"Segersin","permalink":"lindsay-segersin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5914/125914v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5914/125914v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[399,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/5914/125914v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
