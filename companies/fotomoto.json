Service","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":7,"source_url":"","source_text":"SAN FRANCISCO, California (May 7, 2009) â€“ Within two weeks of launching in closed beta on April\r\n12th, Fotomoto, a service that enables photographers to sell images on their own websites, passed the\r\n150-customer mark.\r\nPhotographers and organizations that own or aggregate photos often find the amount of effort required\r\nto sell photos rather frustrating. While creating photo websites has become easy, adding e-commerce\r\nand professional fulfillment to such websites is still a challenge. The only existing solution, selling via\r\ngeneric photo store websites, contradicts the branding and artistic identity of one's own website.\r\nWith Fotomoto, photography websites can instantly attach a \"Buy Now\" button to all of their sellable\r\nphotos. The button â€œknowsâ€ the pricing and availability of the photos, and keeps track of photo\r\neditions. It allows visitors to easily place orders for photos without leaving the website.\r\nâ€œPersonally, I'm really excited by this as it will allow us to provide high-quality prints, to a world-wide\r\naudience, in a much simpler way than previously.\" said photographer David J. Nightingale, whose\r\nwebsite, www.chromasia.com, is viewed by more than 150,000 unique visitors every month.\r\nIn addition to prints, Fotomoto is planning to offer postcards, calendars, photo licensing, and\r\nmerchandise. As the New York Times has observed, â€œthis could turn the industry on its headâ€ by\r\nremoving the middleman and empowering photography websites to sell directly:\r\nï¬ The service can be customized to blend into any website, and takes just a few clicks to install.\r\nï¬ Fotomoto receives, fulfills, and ships the orders on behalf of the site owner.\r\nï¬ Site owners have full control over the pricing of their photos.\r\nï¬ Fotomoto automatically manages their photos, editions, sales, and customer lists for them.\r\nï¬ Organizations and galleries can share revenues with their photographers via Fotomoto.\r\nâ€œThe reaction has been overwhelming.â€ said Ahmad Kiarostami, CEO and co-founder. â€œPhotographers\r\nhave been looking for a solution that would not make them sell their art at online photo supermarkets.\r\nFotomoto allows them to maintain their online artistic brand, and sell directly to their audience. The\r\nvolume of requests to use Fotomoto is staggering, coming literally from all over the world.â€\r\nFotomoto has partnered up with best-in-class printing facilities for premium quality prints, and delivers\r\norders internationally.\r\nAbout Fotomoto\r\nFotomoto enables photographers, magazines, blogs, non-profit organizations, news agencies, and sports\r\nand celebrity websites to sell photos on their own websites. Using Fotomoto, any individual or\r\norganization with photo content can sell photo-based products without sending their customers to thirdparty\r\nwebsites.
