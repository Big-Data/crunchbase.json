It is the British subsidiary of Europe&#8217;s largest and most successful serious online dating service with millions of members, who are predominantly affluent, educated men and women between 28 and 55 years old. Since its launch in Germany in 2001, PARSHIP has matched thousands of single people who are serious about forming a long-lasting relationship. </p>\n\n<p>The first step is an 80-question psychometric test, which is free of charge and takes about 20 minutes to complete. The results of the test create a fascinating profile of each member&#8217;s personality. Using methods based on years of scientific research, this profile is then carefully matched with the profiles of other members whose balance of similar and complementary characteristics marks them out as a potential partner for the new member. </p>\n\n<p>PARSHIP.co.uk operates a 3-tiered pricing system: Â£35 for 1 month, Â£57 for 3 months, Â£84 for 6 months. 75% of people who register with the PARSHIP site go on to complete the psychometric compatibility test. In fact, 2,500 people across Europe complete the test every day. </p>\n\n<p>PARSHIP GmbH, headquartered in Hamburg, is 87%-owned by Holtzbrinck networXs AG, part of the Georg von Holtzbrinck publishing group, one of Germany&#8217;s largest publishing companies with financial interests in more than 80 companies including the Macmillan Group.
