The Companyâ€™s intuitive, web-based drag-and-drop environment enables rapid creation of new casual games and multimedia applications, which can be easily shared on social networks and web sites. Creativity is required, but programming expertise is not! The Companyâ€™s vision is to democratize the creation and sharing of software.</p>\n\n<p>Sharendipity is uniquely extensible. Individuals can leverage or contribute to a growing library of modular content such as game characters, behaviors, special effects, artwork and sounds â€“ which piece together in new and surprising ways. Anything made in Sharendipity can be shared back to the community either in whole or as smaller, reusable components. When those creations have value, Sharendipity provides a secure, integrated marketplace for buyers and sellers to transact.</p>\n\n<p>Non-creators will also find a fresh source of casual games and entertainment in Sharendipity. Our Web portal allows visitors to challenge other players, compete for high scores, rate or comment on applications, and interact with fellow players and creators alike. Over time players will discover that they can customize their favorite games. Sharendipity introduces players to concepts such as importing their own images and sounds into an existing game. Later, they&#8217;ll discover how easy it is to change game play mechanics to create a completely unique experience. Serendipity occurs when consumers become producers.</p>\n\n<p>And casual games are just the beginning. Under the hood, Sharendipity is designed to support a natural progression into other vertical markets. Because the community extends and adds functionality to Sharendipity, a broad range of applications will eventually be possible. We believe this will be of particular interest to niche markets that are poorly served by the traditional software industry.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0002/3705/23705v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0002/3705/23705v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0002/3705/23705v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"3 S.
