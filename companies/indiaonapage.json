You have 3 options:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Ask your friends to get contact numbers for cook/maid etc, which they themselves wonï¿½t be having.\n* Hunt for news paper to get some contact number, which again is not fruitful.\n* Do all chores on your own.

Alas! You have no clue of what to do. Again you have 3 options:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Call Reeta, Ganesh , Amit or Sheeta to check if they are free.\n* Hunt newspaper to see if you get any idea to spend weekend.\n* Stick to your favorite time pass (sleeping).\n\n  Here is the fourth lucrative option:\n\n* 1, Login to www.indiaonapage.com, go to your city page and get all the information you want about movies, events etc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These are not fictitious scenarios but real time scenarios.
