The Zigtag sidebar provides both an intuitive way of tagging web pages (using descriptive words or phrases) and a user-friendly way of quickly retrieving tagged pages.</p>\n\n<p>Users tag web pages with semantic tags (tags which have definitions) e.g. if you tag a page with &#8220;Apple&#8221; you can choose &#8220;Apple (computer company)&#8221;, &#8220;Apple (fruit)&#8221;, â€œApple (record label)â€ etc.  Pages can be retrieved using any of the tags which were previously entered or using synonyms for those tags, e.g. a page tagged with &#8220;Car&#8221; can be retrieved by searching for pages tagged with â€œCarâ€ or â€œAutomobileâ€ (Zigtag understands Car and Automobile are the same). This allows you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your tag space organized â€“ you donâ€™t end up with â€œNew_Yorkâ€, â€œNew-Yorkâ€ and â€œNewYorkâ€ â€“ Zigtag has only one â€œNew York (the city)â€ (although you can search for using â€œNYâ€, â€œNYCâ€ or even â€œBig Appleâ€)</li>\n<li>Search for your bookmarks quickly and efficiently â€“ the type-ahead helps you choose from tags youâ€™ve used and also shows their definitions</li>\n<li>Find what others have tagged effectively â€“ no confusion between â€œStock (soup base)â€ , â€œStock (equities)â€ or â€œStock (inventory)â€</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Zigtag also has a major social networking component; you can see what your friends are tagging and create and join special interest groups.  The sidebar notifies you when your friends tag something new, and a news feed allows you to see what your friends are tagging at a glance.  Itâ€™s kind of a â€œpersonal Diggâ€ - your friends&#8217; interesting sites are likely to be interesting to you.  Zigtag groups form the focal point for collaboration and a central gathering point for people with shared interests.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0001/6353/16353v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,118],"assets/images/resized/0001/6353/16353v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,142],"assets/images/resized/0001/6353/16353v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"Johnson","permalink":"bruce-johnson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Montgomerie","permalink":"scott-montgomerie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Reg","last_name":"Cheramy","permalink":"reg-cheramy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/0149/70149v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/0149/70149v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[376,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/0149/70149v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"delicious","permalink":"delicious","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0000/0499/499v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[247,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/0499/499v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[247,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/0499/499v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"ma.gnolia","permalink":"magnolia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/7992/27992v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,105],"assets/images/resized/0002/7992/27992v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,105],"assets/images/resized/0002/7992/27992v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Bonzobox","permalink":"bonzobox","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/2727/32727v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0003/2727/32727v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0003/2727/32727v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"#206 - 9650 - 20 Avenue T6N 1G1","address2":"","zip_code":"T6E 6V7","city":"Edmonton","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
