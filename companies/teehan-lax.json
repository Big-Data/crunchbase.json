They also created &#8220;the iPhone PSD&#8221;, the first popular Photoshop design tool for creating iPhone interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from creating great digital experiences for clients like Virgin Mobile, Bell, AIR MILES &amp; Corcoran they create self-funded software too. Some of their products include Image Spark (imgspark.com): An image bookmarking service that lets uses save images from anywhere on the Web and organize them in Moodboards.</p>\n\n<p>Their second forthcoming product is called TweetMag. It uses Twitter usernames, hashtags and lists to curate a feed of articles. It only uses tweets that contain links and ignores those that don&#8217;t. When it finds a link, it grabs the headline, an abstract and embeds any associated media (images &amp; videos) into the feed. Essentially, it becomes a feed of articles prioritized by what&#8217;s being tweeted about most. It doesn&#8217;t require users to have a twitter account since they can simply search hashtags or view common topics like technology or sports.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0008/1125/81125v2-max-150x150.png"],[[240,102],"assets/images/resized/0008/1125/81125v2-max-250x250.png"],[[240,102],"assets/images/resized/0008/1125/81125v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Image Spark","permalink":"image-spark","image":null},{"name":"TweetMag","permalink":"tweetmag","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Geoff","last_name":"Teehan","permalink":"geoff-teehan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Lax","permalink":"jon-lax","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Corey","last_name":"Eastman","permalink":"corey-eastman","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Big Spaceship","permalink":"big-spaceship","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0010/9148/109148v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[181,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/9148/109148v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[181,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/9148/109148v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Firstborn Multimedia","permalink":"firstborn-multimedia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,41],"assets/images/resized/0008/6800/86800v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[122,41],"assets/images/resized/0008/6800/86800v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[122,41],"assets/images/resized/0008/6800/86800v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Toronto","address1":"460 Richmond St. W.","address2":"Suite 301","zip_code":"M5V 1Y1","city":"Toronto, ON","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
