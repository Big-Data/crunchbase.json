It&#8217;s faster and handier than phone calls, SMS and online chats. International conversations are free, too.</p>\n\n<p>Talk one-on-one, start your own channel or join one of thousands of existing public channels. Connect globally in 11+ languages.</p>\n\n<p>Check Zello@Work if you want to use Zello on rugged Windows Mobile devices or within a company network.</p>\n\n<p>Zello is based on peer-to-peer architecture and works behind most firewalls and NATs. The software is lightweight (installer less than 1 Mb) and unobtrusive. Normally it runs in the background and can be activated with hotkey without switching the focus or popping up the application window.</p>\n\n<p>The advantages of Zello over existing messaging systems include speed, asynchronous style and voice messaging.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0000/0559/559v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,105],"assets/images/resized/0000/0559/559v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,190],"assets/images/resized/0000/0559/559v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Zello Apps","permalink":"zello","image":null},{"name":"Zello Cloud","permalink":"zello-cloud","image":null},{"name":"Zello Enterprise Server","permalink":"zello-enterprise-server","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Moore","permalink":"bill-moore-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Moore","permalink":"bill-moore","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Alexey","last_name":"Gavrilov","permalink":"alexey-gavrilov","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0000/9586/9586v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0000/9586/9586v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,216],"assets/images/resized/0000/9586/9586v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer","person":{"first_name":"Eugene","last_name":"Mymrin","permalink":"eugene-mymrin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0000/9589/9589v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0000/9589/9589v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,216],"assets/images/resized/0000/9589/9589v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Architect","person":{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Vinogradov","permalink":"alexander-vinogradov","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0000/9592/9592v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0000/9592/9592v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,216],"assets/images/resized/0000/9592/9592v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General director","person":{"first_name":"Veronika","last_name":"Zaslavskaya","permalink":"veronika-zaslavskaya","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0000/9595/9595v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0000/9595/9595v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,216],"assets/images/resized/0000/9595/9595v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sr. Developer","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Pickering","permalink":"jim-pickering","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/6424/196424v2-max-150x150.png"],[[169,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/6424/196424v2-max-250x250.png"],[[304,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/6424/196424v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Voxer LLC","permalink":"voxer-llc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/3859/33859v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0003/3859/33859v7-max-250x250.png"],[[252,58],"assets/images/resized/0003/3859/33859v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"701 Brazos","address2":"","zip_code":"78701","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Moved to Austin","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Zello","permalink":"loudtalks"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
