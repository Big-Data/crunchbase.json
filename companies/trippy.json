It&#8217;s a friend-sourced solution solving the long-standing problem of untrustworthy and irrelevant travel content. </p>\n\n<p>Trippy launched as a finalist in the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2011 Startup Battlefield.  The company was founded by J.R. Johnson and the team that launched and grew VirtualTourist.com and OneTime.com (both bootstrapped and grown to an annual revenue of $18MM and $8MM EBITDA) until the sites were acquired by Expedia in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Trippy ties into social sites like Facebook to find your friends who know about where you&#8217;re traveling to (those who have checked in, live, work, or go to school there) and who already know your personal details (like if youâ€™re vegan, have toddlers, or a penchant for pinot).  It is based on the premise that tapping into the travel experiences of your friends is far more valuable than getting questionable info from random strangers on sites that rely on crowd-sourced solutions.  </p>\n\n<p>Along the way, Trippy aims to inspire and spread &#8220;helper joy&#8221; &#8211; that happy kick you get when a friend has a great experience thanks to advice you shared.  </p>\n\n<p>You get helpful suggestions to make your trip great, and your friends get to relive their favorite travel moments and share their passion for places they know and love. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0015/0579/150579v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0015/0579/150579v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,257],"assets/images/resized/0015/0579/150579v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"J.R.","last_name":"Johnson","permalink":"j-r-johnson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7513/57513v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/7513/57513v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/7513/57513v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>J.R.
