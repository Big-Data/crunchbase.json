The Nocklist database consists of over 800 proprietary designs which are created from the Jason Jenkins portfolio of original artwork.</p>\n\n<p>The Nocklist is a sole proprietorship created in 2001 by abstract surrealist artist Jason Jenkins.  With an M.B.A. from the University of Phoenix, Jason has over 15 years of sales and marketing experience.  Prior to becoming a full time artist, Jason was a successful sales representative for several major corporations.  After developing a strong desire for painting, Jason left the corporate world, used over $300,000 of his personal funds to become a full-time artist and created The Nocklist.</p>\n\n<p>Our brands are created from over 15,000 products consisting of shoes, apparel, posters, drink-ware and original artwork.  The designs that are featured on each product consist of proprietary abstract, surreal and political images painted by Jason Jenkins.    Each online product is created and placed into worldwide distribution by utilizing the vast amount of applications available throughout the internet.</p>\n\n<p>The Nocklistâ€™s current market position is emerging with a tremendous guidance for growth.  Our business model is designed to distribute our database of proprietary content by leveraging online applications.  This model allows for our company to grow exponentially as the internet expands with more applications.</p>\n\n<p>Our companyâ€™s short term objective is to become a division of a complimentary parent company with adequate resources to invest that will grow our brands.  Additional sales and marketing resources would enable The Nocklist to expand our specialized content creation and distribution system.   Long term objectives consist of expanding our product lines with additional divisions being created for live art entertainment and the development of a Jason Jenkins museum.</p>\n\n<p>The Nocklist is a successful company because we have a proven business model that consists of over 15,000 high-quality products along with a unique online sales and distribution system that generates revenue.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0010/2181/102181v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,26],"assets/images/resized/0010/2181/102181v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/2181/102181v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"FOUNDER","person":{"first_name":"JASON","last_name":"JENKINS","permalink":"jason-jenkins-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0011/6410/116410v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0011/6410/116410v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,111],"assets/images/resized/0011/6410/116410v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"ECKO UNLIMITED","permalink":"ecko-unlimited","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$300k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2003,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"PO BOX 88271","address2":"","zip_code":"96830","city":"Honolulu","state_code":"HI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6399/116399v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6399/116399v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6399/116399v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6400/116400v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6400/116400v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6400/116400v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6401/116401v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6401/116401v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6401/116401v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6403/116403v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6403/116403v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6403/116403v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6404/116404v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6404/116404v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6404/116404v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6405/116405v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6405/116405v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6405/116405v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6406/116406v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6406/116406v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6406/116406v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6407/116407v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6407/116407v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6407/116407v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6408/116408v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6408/116408v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6408/116408v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/6409/116409v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/6409/116409v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/6409/116409v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://JASONJENKINSLIVE.ning.com","title":"JASON JENKINS LIVE!"}]}
