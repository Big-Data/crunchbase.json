It&#8217;s the mutual respect that Evony has and enjoys with our player community that we strive to protect and reward.</p>\n\n<p>While competitors have chosen to go for investors and try to emulate our success; weâ€™re proud that Evony has been able to set the standard for free online games that donâ€™t give second-rate quality.  With superior graphics, game play and game mechanics, Evony: Age I has overtaken the traditional online games such as Runescape and Travian and now we command the highest level of reach across the globe for free games.</p>\n\n<p>Evonyâ€™s corporate motto is â€œPride in innovation, value, response and enterprise&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to provide the best and set the standard for browser-based flash online games that are free to play without compromising quality, fun and entertainment for our players.</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™ve succeeded tremendously through the release of our first title, â€œEvony: Age Iâ€ on the 6th of May 2009.  Through an exponential growth from a handful of players and a server to now boasting over 80 servers and 8 million registered active players, Evony has set the bar for video game developers and publishers that free does not mean you have to lack in quality.</p>\n\n<p>We at Evony feel that the future of games is the free to play model called â€œFreemiumâ€; whereby customers can purchase if they want, but are under no obligation to.  It really shows the success of Evony, LLC by going against the normal video game publishing and charging for access or forcing players to pay, or alternatively to forcing players to watch third party advertisements.  Instead of forced loyalty, we&#8217;re able to create an extremely loyal community which grows exponentially through word of mouth as well as marketing and generates a wonderful game community atmosphere where players help one another for the love of the game.  Our model of Freemium sets the standard for the future, and weâ€™re quite proud of that achievement.</p>\n\n<p>Our players who play Evony: Age I are taking part in leading technology and research with lots of hard work and effort from our team to giving them the best in online free entertainment.  With players from around the world, Evony is truly a global phenomenon.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/2159/62159v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/2159/62159v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[308,67],"assets/images/resized/0006/2159/62159v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Kingory","permalink":"kingory","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Global Headquarters","address1":"PMB 6846 Suite 120","address2":"2711 Centerville Road","zip_code":"19808","city":"Wilmington","state_code":"DE","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"8 Million Active Users","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://evony.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=1&Itemid=50","source_text":null,"source_description":"News and Achievements","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Evony","permalink":"evony"}},{"description":"15 Million Active Users","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"http://www.evony.net/index.php?view=article&catid=1:latest-news&id=69:15-million-players","source_text":null,"source_description":"News and Achievements","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Evony","permalink":"evony"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
