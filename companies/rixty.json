FRANCISCO -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Rixty announced today it has expanded its cash payment system to safely include kids under the age of 13. Now kids can utilize Rixtyâ€™s nationwide network of more than 10,000 Coinstar kiosks and 10,000 prepaid card distribution locations to pay for top quality online games and virtual worlds. Rixtyâ€™s new functionality follows the strict guidelines established by the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA) and enforced by the FTC. Kids can now sign up to use Rixty without revealing any personal information and their parents are notified of account creation. This new system has been audited by TRUSTe, an FTC authorized COPPA review agency, and Rixty has been certified as a 2010 TRUSTe Childrenâ€™s Privacy Seal Program member.\r\n\r\nâ€œRixty is committed to protecting the privacy of our all our users, especially our newest users under the age of 13,â€ said Rixty CEO Ted Sorom. â€œIn addition to restricting kidâ€™s access to only kid-safe partners, Rixty does not market to these users, or allow them to post any information on the Rixty network. As we continue to add partnerships with leading kid-focused companies, parents can feel sure that their childâ€™s experience with Rixty will be safe and completely anonymous.â€\r\n\r\nIn addition to current partners like Puzzle Pirates Family and ourWorld, Rixty is now also partnered with Roblox, an online virtual playground and workshop, and Artix Entertainment, creators of the popular Adventure Quest and Dragon Fable games. With Rixtyâ€™s membership in the TRUSTe Childrenâ€™s Privacy Seal Program, kid-focused partners can feel confident that Rixty is now the leader in safe online cash payments for kids and adults.\r\n\r\nâ€œWith more people online now than ever before, the number of cybercriminals trying to exploit consumer information has also grown to record numbers, making third party trustmarks an essential tool for both consumers and businesses,â€ said Fran Maier, President and Executive Chair of TRUSTe. â€œBy becoming a TRUSTe sealholder, Rixty gives its customers a clear signal that it is trustworthy, safe, and respects the privacy wishes of the people who visit its Web site.â€ ","source_description":"Rixty Announces Nationâ€™s First Certified Kid-Friendly Online Cash Payment System","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Rixty","permalink":"rixty"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/4368/74368v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/4368/74368v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[448,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/4368/74368v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
