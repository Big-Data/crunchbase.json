Worlds apart from the traditional translation office, tolingo translations are carried out using it&#8217;s online translation platform.  This modern method and tolingo&#8217;s worldwide translator network not only ensure high quality but also cut out bureaucracy for a much faster and more efficient service.  </p>\n\n<p>So how does it work? The translation process at tolingo starts with the nifty little cost calculator on our homepage which allows customers to get an instant quote as well as an estimated delivery time for their text. As soon as the customer confirms the order, the digital copy of the text is sent to tolingo&#8217;s database and then picked up by an available translator with suitable language skills and specialist experience. The translator then translates the text using tolingo&#8217;s online software which simultaenously allows the customer to keep track of the order progress. After the translation is completed and once any necessary proofreading/correction is carried out, the finished order is delivered to the customer. This direct and unbureacratic chain from customer to translator to customer allows tolingo to handle a large volume of orders day and night and dramatically reduce customer waiting time.</p>\n\n<p>With the launch of tolingo.com, tolingo hopes to reach both customers and translators on a worldwide scale. But itâ€™s not only the customer/translator base that is unlimited; tolingo is constantly thinking up new ways to improve it&#8217;s service and technology. tolingo listens to feedback from translators and customers alike and employ a young and dynamic team to think up creative new solutions for it&#8217;s translation service and technology. Many new developments, document formatting and translation memory to name but two, are just around the corner so watch this
