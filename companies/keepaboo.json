The service is user friendly, and very easy to use.  Parents can upload pictures, record developmental milestones, write diary entries, enter growth data, of fun memories of their baby or child.  The system can then automatically create a online scrapbook with those items.  Parents can also create custom books using selected items.</p>\n\n<p>Keepaboo also has an interactive timeline that provides parents with an overview of their child&#8217;s life.  Each of the items is automatically added to the timeline, and each is represented by a different icon.</p>\n\n<p>The dynamic timeline gives users instant access to all the items they create.  Using the timeline, users can access any past date or age and explore memories of a child&#8217;s life.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0002/8649/28649v1-max-150x150.png"],[[183,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/8649/28649v1-max-250x250.png"],[[183,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/8649/28649v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/8648/28648v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0002/8648/28648v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[359,196],"assets/images/resized/0002/8648/28648v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
