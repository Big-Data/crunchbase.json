EcoApprentice 1.0 is a working prototype. v2.0 will take us to revenue.  We have a variety of business models on the burner to get there.</p>\n\n<p>How does EcoApprentice work?</p>\n\n<p>Organizations or individuals seeking an eco-friendly solution to some aspect of operations or home life, post an EcoChallenge.  EcoApprentice aims to encourage thinking-outside-the-box ideas which are added to a growing list of EcoSolutions. People from around the country will collaborate and respond with real-world EcoSolutions. After crowd sourcing a challenge, the best solution is posted.  The respondents with the best answer (as chosen by the person that posted it) may receive a reward or recognition.</p>\n\n<p>Participation on the EcoApprentice platform demonstrates that an individual, organization, business, or company  is committed to sustainable best practices, and the health of their local community. In many cases, being more efficient also equals more profit.</p>\n\n<p>College and University students can add unique experience to a resume or earn class credit for green solutions. We already have MBA students engaged with a business to help solve a challenge; the goal is to create these kinds of connections through out the United States and eventually &#8211; globally.</p>\n\n<p>SIGN UP IS FREE!</p>\n\n<p>SEEKING TECHNICAL CO-FOUNDER OR MARKETING SAVVY BIZ PARTNER.
