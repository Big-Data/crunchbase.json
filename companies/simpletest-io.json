It is primarily used during developing web applications, because just while developing most of errors occur. It is not possbile to develop web applications without errors so the best way is to find errors immediately after they ocur, before your customer does!</p>\n\n<p>You can easily create your own tests. We are focused on simplicity of use. Using SimpleTestIO is easy and intuitive and it does not require any technical skills.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Katarina","last_name":"Cabalova","permalink":"katarina-cabalova","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Miroslav","last_name":"Varga","permalink":"miroslav-varga","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Michal","last_name":"Spacek","permalink":"michal-spacek","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Lukas","last_name":"Hudecek","permalink":"lukas-hudecek","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6541/146541v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/6541/146541v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/6541/146541v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"LomnickÃ©ho 1705/7","address2":"","zip_code":"14097","city":"Praha 4","state_code":null,"country_code":"CZE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
