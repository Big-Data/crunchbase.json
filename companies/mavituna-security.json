We are a well-funded company and we are here to stay. We focused on a single product &#8220;Netsparker, Web Application Security Scanner&#8221; and are not developing any other product or providing any other service.</p>\n\n<p>The development and security research team is led by Ferruh Mavituna, who is also the founder of the company and a well-known application security researcher.</p>\n\n<p>Netsparker</p>\n\n<p>We are committed to developing a web application security scanner which accomplishes what it claims. A web application security scanner should find vulnerabilities and should not report false-positives. Therefore, instead of spending our time on creating useless features, we focused on actually finding vulnerabilities and eliminating false-positives.</p>\n\n<p>Netsparker has confirmation and exploitation engines. These engines ensure that it does not report any false-positives and allow users to see the actual impact of attacks instead of a text which explains what might happen.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0006/8865/68865v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0006/8865/68865v2-max-250x250.png"],[[350,79],"assets/images/resized/0006/8865/68865v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ferruh","last_name":"Mavituna","permalink":"ferruh-mavituna","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"IBM","permalink":"ibm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","permalink":"hewlett-packard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[242,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[291,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/4529/14529v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Cenzic","permalink":"cenzic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/2942/22942v1-max-150x150.png"],[[224,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/2942/22942v1-max-250x250.png"],[[224,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/2942/22942v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
