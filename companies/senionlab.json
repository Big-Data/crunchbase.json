SenionLab provides a pedestrian indoor navigation system intend to work in indoor environment such as shopping malls, governamental institutions, universities, hospitals, museums and airports. The indoor navigation solution is delivered as a separate software module together with a fully documented Application Programming Interface (API) that can be integrated into third-party iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Android location based mobile applications.  Navigation and positioning is based only on the sensors available on the mobile device. No additional hardware is required besides the mobile device for navigation and positioning</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0016/1729/161729v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0016/1729/161729v2-max-250x250.png"],[[312,85],"assets/images/resized/0016/1729/161729v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Bunus","permalink":"peter-bunus-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/7382/157382v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/7382/157382v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/7382/157382v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Peter Bunus</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Bunus","permalink":"peter-bunus","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Bunus","permalink":"peter-bunus-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/7382/157382v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/7382/157382v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/7382/157382v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Peter Bunus</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"The Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"","source_description":"The Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems and the Swedish Energy Agency","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":12,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Swedish Office","address1":"Plojaregatan 104","address2":"","zip_code":"58333","city":"Linkoping","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"US Office ","address1":"1810 Embarcadero Road","address2":"Suite 100A","zip_code":"94303","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0015/5513/155513v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,194],"assets/images/resized/0015/5513/155513v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,350],"assets/images/resized/0015/5513/155513v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://youtu.be/gVQUXYexE-g","title":"Indoor Positioning by SenionLab Displayed on Micello Map"}]}
