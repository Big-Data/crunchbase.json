like Looks (mix &amp; match Fashion products into desirable looks), Virtual Model (dress a Virtual Model, including the Brazilian top-model Ana Hickmann), Closet (to organize his own Fashion products), Snip (to share posts, articles, etc.) and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Fashion.me also has an open API so all Fashion-apps developers can take advantage of the &#8220;Fashion Social Graph&#8221;
