As the SuperFan, the user would gain control over certain aspects of the Fave profile such as the color palette, wallpaper, profile picture and can add a personal quote about their Fave.  SuperFan worked like a video game where Fans earn Points for contributing to the site and climb higher Reputation Levels.  Fans could also earn or buy Credits (virtual currency) to be used to compete to become the SuperFan, send a virtual gift, post a site-wide Shout-Out or customize the Fan profile. The site also had user-generated quizzes, blogs, battles, etc.  </p>\n\n<p>SuperFan was founded by Rick Marini who was previously the Co-Founder, CFO &amp; Chief Strategist of Tickle. Under his leadership, Tickle became a top 20 global website with 200 million registered users and close to $40 million of revenue.  Tickle was acquired by Monster in 2004 for over $100 million.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0005/0209/50209v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0005/0209/50209v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0005/0209/50209v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
