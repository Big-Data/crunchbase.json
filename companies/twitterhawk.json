Instead of showing some kind of ad on a site, hoping a user will click though, TwitHawk sends a reply Tweet TO the user from the marketer.</p>\n\n<p>e.g,. a company could setup a campaign to search for people within 100 miles of New York talking about how they just got a &#8220;speeding ticket&#8221;, TwitHawk could then find this tweet, and send a response from the company via Twitter saying something like &#8220;ouch, you know there&#8217;s a pretty good chance of having your ticket canceled, check this out http://bit.ly/xxxxx&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to kick off a relationship, which they can then turn into a lead. (i.e., it&#8217;s a lead generation tool, letting the user then turn that lead into a true opportunity / customer.)</p>\n\n<p>It costs 5 cents per Tweet sent via TwitHawk, and one year on, the site wide average CPC is around 2 cents, a number that blows other online marketing methods out of the water.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/0200/70200v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[245,97],"assets/images/resized/0007/0200/70200v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[245,97],"assets/images/resized/0007/0200/70200v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"TwitHawk","permalink":"twithawk","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Evangelist","person":{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"Kan","permalink":"alicia-kan","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Duell","permalink":"chris-duell","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/2477/72477v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/2477/72477v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[415,415],"assets/images/resized/0007/2477/72477v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Chris
