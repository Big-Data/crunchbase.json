EDG (pronounced edge) is the worldâ€™s first digital video player.  At an average cost of only $17.50 to $29.50 (in quantity) EDG reflects the growing demand for digital tools used in business to rival the digital toys (MP3 players) used for entertainment.\nAbout the size of a thick credit card, EDG makes it easy (no computer needed) for companies to showcase their custom audio/video or slide show information where it can be viewed on the cardâ€™s 2â€ high-resolution LCD color screen.  The video and variable volume capabilities make it an ideal medium for communicating to clients and prospects.  Content can be loaded one time or changed repeatedly through the cardâ€™s USB port that simultaneously charges the card battery.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the obvious attraction to its smart design, EDG is an affordable interactive information delivery tool that can be used to build business and communicate with prospects.  Specifically, EDG can be used as a digital press release or portfolio, an event memento, a contest mechanism, a code-compliant (pharmaceutical) education tool, a destination souvenir, a frequent flyer membership card, a trade show giveaway, a direct mail video brochure, a product manual, a language learning device, and much more.  </p>\n\n<p>The benefits of this unique delivery system:\nâ€¢ Content is managed/updated via the Internet         â€¢ Affordably priced for bulk purchase\nâ€¢ Usage can be tracked and measured               â€¢ Both the skin (fascia) and content can be branded\nâ€¢ Easy to convert existing content to load on EDG         â€¢ Controlled content â€“ only the buyer can change it\nâ€¢ Simple to use design (no manual needed)             â€¢ Small size is easy to carry \nâ€¢ Private relationship-building tool                  â€¢ Generates revenue through membership/ad fees</p>\n\n<p>For viewing an EDG card demo or to receive a free information kit, contact us at: edginfo@jumplab.com.
