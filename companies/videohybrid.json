The site also has a ranking system for &#8220;hunters&#8221; who go and find video requests. Videohybrid hosts a lot of illegal content including full-length movies and TV shows, so it will be interesting to see how they handle the inevitable legal issues. Users can find a large array of video content including full-length movies, like The Bourne Ultimatum, because Videohybrid pulls videos from other video sites and allows users to upload illegal video content. </p>\n\n<p>Two high school students from San Jose, CA, started the site. Videohybrid is currently in beta. Hari Rajagopalan (CEO &amp; Founder) and James Xu (Director of Marketing) sold the technology to a group from LA before heading off to college. </p>\n\n<p>Competitors include <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/tvlinks\" title=\"TV Links\">TV Links</a>, <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/alluc\" title=\"Alluc.org\">Alluc.org</a>, <a href=\"http://peekvid.com/\" title=\"PeekVid\" rel=\"nofollow\">PeekVid</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/c/veoh\" title=\"Veoh\">Veoh</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/gofish\" title=\"GoFish\">GoFish</a>.</p>\n\n<p>VideoHybrid users may also be interested in <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/get-youtube-movie/\" title=\"this way\">this way</a> to download <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/youtube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos as well as the large group of <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/04/forget-youtube-go-to-these-sites-if-you-want-hard-core-copyright-infringing-content/\" title=\"companies\">companies</a> being targeted by the MPAA and major production houses for hosting copyrighted material.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0000/0097/97v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,51],"assets/images/resized/0000/0097/97v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,51],"assets/images/resized/0000/0097/97v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Videohybrid","permalink":"videohybrid","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"TV Links","permalink":"tvlinks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/1240/1240v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/1240/1240v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,42],"assets/images/resized/0000/1240/1240v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"TV Shack","permalink":"tv-shack","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0001/1007/11007v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/1007/11007v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/1007/11007v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.316466,"longitude":-121.873881}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
