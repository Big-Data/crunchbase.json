Consequently, this unique, immersive, &#8220;Mirror World&#8221; gaming experience does not rely on a heavy client download.  plaYce is designed such that every pixel has a world co-ordinate, enabling integration with user generated content and other forms of geo-tagged data.</p>\n\n<p>plaYce connects gamers with their social graph through quick engagement, synchronous, social games. At the same time, plaYce provides Game-Infrastructure-as-a-Service, enabling independent developers to design games situated anywhere in the world: car races in Hong Kong, first-person shooters in the Amazon, treasure hunts in Manhattan, etc.  Aside from the technological benefits, plaYce saves game designers 50-75% of development costs and significant time to market.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0002/4790/24790v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4790/24790v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[215,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4790/24790v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Yoram","last_name":"Avidan","permalink":"yoram-avidan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & VP Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Carmel","last_name":"Gerber","permalink":"carmel-gerber","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Production","person":{"first_name":"Stewart","last_name":"Bonn","permalink":"stewart-bonn","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8962/28962v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/8962/28962v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[271,378],"assets/images/resized/0002/8962/28962v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94123","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.80204,"longitude":-122.438231}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object id=\"otv_o_861331\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\"  classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param value=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/702472\" name=\"movie\" /><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\" /><param value=\"always\" name=\"allowScriptAccess\" /><param value=\"transparent\" name=\"wmode\" /><param value=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" name=\"flashvars\" /><embed name=\"otv_e_426416\" id=\"otv_e_415105\" flashvars=\"viewcount=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;brand=embed&amp;\" height=\"320\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/702472\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /></object>","description":"<p>tc50</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
