The mobile voucher platform has been embraced by some of the top national brands such as Debenhams, Gap, Pizza Hut, PizzaExpress and Strada as well as 1000&#8217;s of local businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Vouchercloud is one of the first mobile applications to have a direct financial benefit to the consumer. This clearly measurable gain presents an opportunity for generating ongoing incremental revenues.</p>\n\n<p>The GPS location-based app is also supported by a bespoke online merchants&#8217; dashboard, which will transform the way in which discounts are promoted throughout the UK and Europe. </p>\n\n<p>Developed over 12 months by IDL, the web-based merchant dashboard allows any business, whether a major international corporate chain or your favourite local family-run bistro to instantly upload their own branded offer directly to their target customer&#8217;s mobile and the Vouchercloud site, a tailor-made promotion which they can then track and control.</p>\n\n<p>This is an instant and highly flexible direct advertising platform.</p>\n\n<p>The Vouchercloud website is a portal for every kind of saving of interest to the end user. Under the motto of &#8220;live more, spend less,&#8221; the site gives users a choice of platforms to receive their preferred money-saving offers: either via their mobile, printable vouchers or online voucher codes. </p>\n\n<p>The site also presents a sizeable added revenue opportunity from voucher codes. </p>\n\n<p>The response from merchants to the Vouchercloud proposition has been exceptional. We have already secured over 2000 brand relationships across multiple verticals. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6263/76263v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/6263/76263v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/6263/76263v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"vouchercloud","permalink":"vouchercloud","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"MD","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Le Tocq","permalink":"greg-le-tocq","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor, head of m-commerce ","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Wood","permalink":"matthew-wood","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/5027/215027v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,160],"assets/images/resized/0021/5027/215027v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,160],"assets/images/resized/0021/5027/215027v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technical Director","person":{"first_name":"Noman","last_name":"Mohammad Tee","permalink":"noman-mohammad-tee","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board observer","person":{"first_name":"Frederic","last_name":"Lardieg","permalink":"frederic-lardieg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0019/0219/190219v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0019/0219/190219v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0019/0219/190219v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Vodafone Ventures","permalink":"vodafone-ventures","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"First Floor, 77 West Street","address2":"","zip_code":"BS3 3NU","city":"Bristol","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"1.8M downloads of the app","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":4,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"vouchercloud","permalink":"invitation-digital"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7253/77253v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/7253/77253v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/7253/77253v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/7254/77254v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0007/7254/77254v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,148],"assets/images/resized/0007/7254/77254v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[90,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/3166/173166v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/3166/173166v2-max-250x250.png"],[[270,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/3166/173166v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.vouchercloud.com/discount-voucher-codes","title":"Voucher Codes"},{"external_url":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/nov/12/elevator-pitch-vouchercloud","title":"Vouchercloud elevator pitch"}]}
