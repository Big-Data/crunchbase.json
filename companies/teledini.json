Teledini enables instant interaction from a company’s website when a site visitor is most ready to buy, thereby raising the conversion rate of website visitors into customers.</p>\n\n<p>Despite investing countless hours and dollars on content, design, pay-per-click advertising, and search engine optimization, businesses take on average 42 hours to interact with a visitor to their website. As a result, the conversion rate of website visitors into customers for most businesses is unacceptably low (1-4%).</p>\n\n<p>Teledini’s products, Call2Action &amp; CallerIQ, provide an instantaneous voice path from the website visitor to the web owner while simultaneously delivering relevant data about the web visitor while the visitor is still on the site.\nProducts/Services: Not to be confused with legacy click-to-call or click-to-callback products, Teledini’s Call2Action starts dialing the web owner as soon as a web visitor clicks the Call2Action button on the website. Call2Action uses the microphone and speakers of the visitor’s computer instead of a phone.</p>\n\n<p>Call2Action offers a variety of call handling options to answer web calls. They can be handled as a traditional incoming call or a unique ring plan can quickly route the call to the right person.</p>\n\n<p>Call2Action is completely free to set up and simple to install – simply copy and paste a few lines of code into the footer of the website. Website owners don’t pay until they’re on a call with a website visitor.</p>\n\n<p>Teledini’s Caller IQ, helps to maximize the value of customer interactions, by displaying key information about a caller as the call arrives. This enables immediate relevant responses to the caller and opens up tremendous tracking capabilities. Caller IQ’s reports make it possible to track online campaigns, banner advertising, and site performance on a page-by-page basis not only periodically, but in real- time as desired.</p>\n\n<p>Statistics show that the odds of entering a sales lead into a sales cycle increases 21X if contacted immediately vs.only 30 minutes later.</p>\n\n<p>With Teledini, live sales and customer service has never been easier.</p>\n\n<p>E-Commerce sites can reduce shopping cart abandonment by resolving technical, administrative and product-related issues. They can up-sell additional products or services to increase their average revenue per order. Research has proven live interaction systems boost online sales at least 60%.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0020/6980/206980v2-max-150x150.png"],[[209,36],"assets/images/resized/0020/6980/206980v2-max-250x250.png"],[[209,36],"assets/images/resized/0020/6980/206980v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & COO","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Smithwick","permalink":"steve-smithwick-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Deegan","permalink":"jason-deegan","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Wei","last_name":"Wang","permalink":"wei-wang","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"600 Galleria Parkway","address2":"Suite 550","zip_code":"30339","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0020/8374/208374v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0020/8374/208374v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,226],"assets/images/resized/0020/8374/208374v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0020/8375/208375v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0020/8375/208375v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,136],"assets/images/resized/0020/8375/208375v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
