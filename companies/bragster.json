In Bragster you donâ€™t place cash bets, you simply â€˜bragâ€™ to your friends that you will do something, like turn up at work in your pajamas.  You can bet anything you want. Itâ€™s very video oriented as well, so people can see proof of your dare. Revenues will eventually come from â€™sponsored bragsâ€™ created by brands which want to distribute a marketing message in a fun way, and they are looking to license a white label version of the platform. Bragster is biggest in English speaking territories like the UK, US and Canada.</p>\n\n<p>Bragster is the re-launched version of Gottabet, a site which won a seed round in 2006 but dumped itâ€™s cash bettings model.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0001/2100/12100v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,205],"assets/images/resized/0001/2100/12100v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,370],"assets/images/resized/0001/2100/12100v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Bragster","permalink":"bragster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0005/1682/51682v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,207],"assets/images/resized/0005/1682/51682v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,372],"assets/images/resized/0005/1682/51682v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Wim","last_name":"Vernaeve","permalink":"wim-vernaeve","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0001/2106/12106v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[170,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/2106/12106v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[170,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/2106/12106v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP
