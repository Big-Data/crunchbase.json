Kehalim (Hebrew for &#8220;Audiences&#8221;) matches users&#8217; geography, interests and specifically content displayed to the most relevant, highest-paying affiliate offers.</p>\n\n<p>Publishers are exempt from tedious affiliate tasks and do not need to worry about selecting, monitoring or expiring campaigns, negotiating with merchants or even signing up on the various networks. They are given complete, transparent reporting about their impressions, earnings and can track CTR/EPC and eCPM metrics for each of their selected channels.</p>\n\n<p>Kehalim is very flexible in the way ads are matched, triggered, located and displayed. Any real-estate on any platform (web, software, mobile, email, chat rooms, etc.) can be optimized with either image, flash, text and/or product ads.</p>\n\n<p>Integration is easy, simply include a one line JavaScript code or monetize apps based on open-API.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Kehalim simplifies the process for monetizing CPA (Cost Per Action) similar to how Google AdSense simplified CPC and RightMedia simplified CPM, so publishers can just concentrate on bringing more content.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/9847/29847v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0002/9847/29847v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0002/9847/29847v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters, R&D","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Ra'anana","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/te_5WXM8XeU&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/te_5WXM8XeU&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Michael Lugassy, Founder &amp; CEO in TechCrunch50 (Hebrew)</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vlhE-8G9gJM&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vlhE-8G9gJM&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Kehalim Elevator Pitch </p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/8020/68020v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,171],"assets/images/resized/0006/8020/68020v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,308],"assets/images/resized/0006/8020/68020v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
