With over 100 million completed installs per month, the market leading installation platform increases completed installs, decreases download time, and improves the user install experience.  </p>\n\n<p>The InstallCore™ installer may be customized to fit the software’s look and feel, so the installation experience remains seamless to the end-user. The system enables A/B testing of different installer skins, demonstrating which designs work most successfully, which in turns aids installer optimization.</p>\n\n<p>The high installation completion rate is in-part attributed to the high-performance installation engine, which bypasses common technical points of failure relating to operating systems or browser specifications and settings. The installer expedites installation and results in about 32% more completed installs than without.</p>\n\n<p>To aid the continuous improvement of installation completion rates, a unique, data-driven BI dashboard provides meaningful information to measure, monitor, analyze and optimize. Thus, publishers gain deeper understanding of their installation funnel performance, learning which stages may be adjusted for the highest completion and monetization outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Web software publishers and distributors worldwide use the installation platform to increase revenues and deliver utility-based product or service offerings to their end-users. To this end, ironSource works in partnership with highly reputable advertising partners such as Google, Bing, and Ask.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0021/8038/218038v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0021/8038/218038v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,203],"assets/images/resized/0021/8038/218038v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO ","person":{"first_name":"Tomer","last_name":"Bar Zeev","permalink":"tomer-bar-zeev","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/8304/218304v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[194,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/8304/218304v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[349,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/8304/218304v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO ","person":{"first_name":"Arnon","last_name":"Harish","permalink":"arnon-harish","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Assaf","last_name":"Ben Ami","permalink":"assaf-ben-ami","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Communications","person":{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"Becker","permalink":"pamela-becker","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO ","person":{"first_name":"Tamir","last_name":"Carmi","permalink":"tamir-carmi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO ","person":{"first_name":"Itay","last_name":"Milrad","permalink":"itay-milrad","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"ironSource","address1":"63 Rothschild Blvd","address2":"","zip_code":"65785","city":"Tel Aviv","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1KaAsng_Ung?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Your App Starts Here</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0021/8039/218039v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,145],"assets/images/resized/0021/8039/218039v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,262],"assets/images/resized/0021/8039/218039v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InstallCore","title":"InstallCore on Wikipedia"}]}
