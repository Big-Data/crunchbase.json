At Thirst, we believe that people want to have deeper engagement with their content but it is difficult to parse through the noise and real time nature of current platforms.  Thirst uses its custom NLP to filter, organize, and present the content in a way that drives engagement and use. Majority of all content produced get no engagement, and unless one is actively reading, they are bound to miss a lot of important information.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/0318/190318v2-max-150x150.png"],[[169,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/0318/190318v2-max-250x250.png"],[[304,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/0318/190318v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Anuj","last_name":"Verma","permalink":"anuj-verma","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5793/95793v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[173,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5793/95793v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[311,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/5793/95793v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CTO","person":{"first_name":"Kunal","last_name":"Modi","permalink":"kunal-modi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/5794/95794v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/5794/95794v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/5794/95794v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/42249625\" width=\"430\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/42249625\">Thirst for Twitter</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/thirstlabs\">Thirst</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2012/05/16/thirst-app-twitter/","title":"Thirst App Will Change The Way You View Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/16/thirst-aims-to-slake-your-hunger-for-relevant-twitter-content/","title":"Thirst Aims To Slake Your Hunger For Relevant Twitter Content"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/thirst-iphone/","title":"Content Recommendation Startup Thirst Brings Its Twitter App To The iPhone"},{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2012/08/04/9-apps-you-dont-want-to-miss/#79959Thirst","title":"9 Apps You Donâ€™t Want To Miss"},{"external_url":"http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/08/thirst-for-twitter-gets-filled-up-with-universal-support-icloud-sync-and-more","title":"Thirst For Twitter Gets Filled Up With Universal Support, iCloud Sync And More"}]}
