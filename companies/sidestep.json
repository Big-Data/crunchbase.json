It searches more than 200 websites looking for the best travel deals.</p>\n\n<p>SideStep has recently been aggressive in building up its offerings.  They acquired <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/tripup\" title=\"TripUp\">TripUp</a> (a social network focused on travel) and TravelPost.com (a hotel ratings site) with the goal of becoming &#8220;the leader in online travel related information.&#8221;  In addition, they have launched two <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> applications. The Trips Facebook application provides a trip planning service that currently has over 150,000 users. The Extended Info application allows users to add fields and categories of their own choice to a Facebook profile. SideStep is also developing a Facebook App for TripUp that should be launched later in the year.</p>\n\n<p>SideStep was acquired in December 2007 by their nearest competitor Kayak for roughly $180,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>Other popular travel metasearch sites and SideStep competitors include <a href=\"http://www.cheapflights.com\" title=\"Cheapflights\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cheapflights</a>, <a
