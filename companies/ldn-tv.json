It also shares content with producers in a 50/50 agreement. </p>\n\n<p>On LDN.TV the medium is the message. It is the first British broadcaster to blur the line between publisher-broadcaster/media buyer and medium. </p>\n\n<p>LDN.TVâ€™s output is very varied. It often has one-off live broadcasts from London events, or serialized drama, documentaries, fashion programs, London borough orientated news servicesâ€™, light entertainment, popular local musician interview shoes, live broadcasts from busy locations, Thursday night magazine shows, and films. 90% of the programming is currently produced out-of-house. </p>\n\n<p>All content must have strong affiliations to London. (it may be set in London, on the subject of London,  use London locations or the producer must be London based.)   </p>\n\n<p>LDN.TV aims to be the enfant terrible of British broadcasting and constantly be a source of amusement and debate for its fans, whilst remaining a thorn in the backside of tired and established national broadcasters. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, Chief Creative Officer","person":{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"Butt","permalink":"omar-butt","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":16,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Northport Holdings","permalink":"northport-holdings","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Register address","address1":"St John's Street","address2":"London","zip_code":"EC1V","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
