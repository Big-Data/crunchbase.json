Co-founders Tom O&#8217;Malley &amp; Don Lavis began building BarChannels after countless frustrating occasions of needing such a resource. Every week seemed to present the same question: How can a couple of rowdy, high-fiving gentlemen find a bar that is filled with our team&#8217;s fans and playing our team&#8217;s games? You can&#8217;t! Well&#8230; you couldn&#8217;t. But now you can!</p>\n\n<p>There are many wonderful websites, apps &amp; guides out there to help people discover bars in their city. A simple search of these resources will conclude that almost all sports bars play a wide range of games. However, many do favor a handful of specific teams and those places truly are your best chances for a great time!</p>\n\n<p>BarChannels.com was created to bring like-minded sports fans together at the best places to watch their favorite teams.</p>\n\n<p>The 5 Commandments\nMay we never stray from our founding principles:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>All bar listings shall be kept accurate and up-to-date by our editors.</li>\n<li>Reviews &amp; ratings shall be informative, helpful and un-biased.</li>\n<li>This site shall never be overrun with ads, pop-ups or promotions.</li>\n<li>Simplicity is key, while maintaining sexy aesthetic standards.</li>\n<li>Push to exceed expectations with fresh content &amp; new features.</li>\n</ol>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"O'Malley","permalink":"tom-omalley","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Don","last_name":"Lavis","permalink":"don-lavis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Dewayne","last_name":"Johnson","permalink":"dewayne-johnson","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Tribeca Office","address1":"12 Desbrosses street","address2":"","zip_code":"10013","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
