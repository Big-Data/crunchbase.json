The underlying platform is unique in the way it uses client-side cryptography and decentralised control to ensure security and privacy between end-users. </p>\n\n<p>Lockbox is for people who &#8220;care&#8221; about privacy and confidentiality when sharing information with friends, associates and clients. By providing end-to-end strong credentials and encryption, Lockbox can ensure that confidential information stored and exchanged can only ever be seen by those people that the owner of the workspace has granted access to. No-one else, not even Lockbox technical staff, can view information in a Lockbox.</p>\n\n<p>Lockbox founders and staff are renown specialists in cryptography, security and privacy. Our team includes the lead developers that founded (in 2001) and continue to support the world renowned Bouncy Castle cryptographic engine which is being used by over 10,000 organisations around the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0014/4640/144640v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0014/4640/144640v2-max-250x250.png"],[[269,57],"assets/images/resized/0014/4640/144640v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Long","permalink":"peter-long","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Rick","last_name":"Harvey","permalink":"rick-harvey","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Hook","permalink":"david-hook","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Lockbox Australia","address1":"Level 3","address2":"627 Chapel Street","zip_code":"3141","city":"South Yarra, VIC","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Lockbox USA","address1":"675 N. 1st Street","address2":"Suite 1200","zip_code":"95112","city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
