The site was re-launched in March of 2012 to focus on allowing users to manage their Facebook activity in new and different ways.</p>\n\n<p>The name Kweet is derived from the Afrikaans word weet, which means &#8220;to know&#8221;. It is also a colloquialism that refers to something &#8220;kool and sweet&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Asimwe, working from his home in Nairobi, Kenya, and Antoine Sorel Neron, in the US, built Kweet to serve as a place for users to get to know each other through their shared interests. </p>\n\n<p>Advanced privacy controls let users create groups on Kweet to share with their Facebook contacts. A user can share content such as photos, images, links and more with a select group of friends on Facebook without sharing it with their entire Facebook contact list. Users across Kweet can also find each other based on shared interests rather than just through friend-of-a-friend connections.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/1621/121621v2-max-150x150.png"],[[164,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/1621/121621v2-max-250x250.png"],[[164,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/1621/121621v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Antoine Sorel","last_name":"Neron","permalink":"antoine-sorel-neron","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Asimwe","permalink":"chris-asimwe-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Digg","permalink":"digg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,158],"assets/images/resized/0000/4138/4138v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Reddit","permalink":"reddit","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/3886/3886v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2225 E.Bayshore Rd","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"94303","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0022/3645/223645v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0022/3645/223645v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,317],"assets/images/resized/0022/3645/223645v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
