With Take Charge, you donâ€™t have to unplug. By turning off the power after a timed charge, Take Charge PowerSavers automatically eliminate the power drain, lengthen the life of your batteries, reduce your electric bill by up to 8-10% and shrink your carbon footprint for many devices.</p>\n\n<p>According to Denny Miller, CEO of Take Charge, â€œIf every household in the state of Iowa used one of these smart power outlets, the potential energy savings would be over $60 million and the carbon footprint would be reduced accordingly. If everyone in the United States used a Take Charge PowerSaver, energy savings would translate to a total of over $6 billion dollars annually.â€</p>\n\n<p>The Take Charge PowerSavers are available in three models, which are cETL-approved for use in your home or business. The UTC4W offers three timer-controlled outlets in a convenient wall tap unit with one â€œalways onâ€ outlet. The UTC4S has three timer-controlled outlets with one â€œalways onâ€ outlet in a strip form with 2-foot cord. Each product has the 3-hour timer and LED indicator lights with one-touch timer start buttons. The  UTC8MS offers 8 outlets with two â€œalways onâ€ outlets, and one master outlet that controls five â€œcontrolledâ€ outlets in a strip form. The control outlet automatically senses power consumption and will turn on/off any connected peripherals.</p>\n\n<p>All Take Charge PowerSavers offer surge protection and come with a plugged-in Connected Equipment Protection Policy. The policy covers properly connected equipment up to $50,000.</p>\n\n<p>These power strips became available in the United States in March 2011, the UTC4W and UTC4S will be offered at the MSRP of $19.95 and $24.95, and the UTC8MS at the MSRP of  $29.95.</p>\n\n<p>For sales information, please contact JASBR LLC at sales@jasbr.com or 866-359-4848, ext. 110.</p>\n\n<p>Take Charge LLC is built on a collaborative management structure with combined experience from Denny Miller, CEO, and Rob Fick.
