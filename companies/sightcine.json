Our initial product is an innovative solution for simultaneously displaying subtitles in multiple languages on a single movie theater screen. This solution will increase cinema audiences by enabling moviegoers who are wearing specially designed glasses to view subtitles not visible to the naked eye. As a result, the film industry will be able to accommodate two large, under-served markets in the US, specifically the hearing-impaired and non-English speakers, by providing unobtrusive subtitles in any moviegoerâ€™s preferred language. The vast majority of US films are shown without subtitles, preventing approximately 30 million hearing impaired and 30 million non-native speakers from enjoying feature films in theatres.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0007/5238/75238v1-max-150x150.png"],[[243,87],"assets/images/resized/0007/5238/75238v1-max-250x250.png"],[[243,87],"assets/images/resized/0007/5238/75238v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2010/01/movie_subtitle.html","source_description":"Movie Sub-title Techs' SightCine Raises Seed","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":27,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OObCl4jEm98&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OObCl4jEm98&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
