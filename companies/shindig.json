Shindig&#8217;s proprietary technology allows for the free flowing engagement of participants in large-scale group chats. In Shindig, you see the natural ebb and flow of conversations and move seamlessly between them. Current video chat locks you in a conversation and creates a feeling of imprisonment. Shindig acknowledges that freedom as to how you engage and with whom you engage is an indispensable ingredient in a natural and comfortable video chat experience.</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded in 2009 by Yale College, Harvard Law grad Steve Gottlieb whose prior entrepreneurial success includes building TVT Records, one of the most successful independent record labels in the history of the US recording industry, acompany with an unprecedented 25 Gold and Platinum releases to its credit.
