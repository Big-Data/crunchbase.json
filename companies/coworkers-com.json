The main site directs you to enter in the email address of a coworker, (presumably their work email address), and simply rate them on a scale from 1 to 10. You&#8217;re allowed to remain &#8220;anonymous&#8221; in this rating.  Rating their overall ability brings you to a following page where you can drill down them a bit further: there are sections for <strong>core values</strong>, <strong>interpersonal</strong>, <strong>competence</strong>, and <strong>productivity</strong>.  You can add further data such as your relationship to this person (boss? advisor?), amount of contact, number of years with them, and tags.  Submitting this data, it&#8217;s now searchable by other users. </p>\n\n<p>The site allows users to build their own profiles, and there is an emphasis not just on using the site to anonymous trash coworkers, but on making recommendations.  The site also has groups, that allows users to better track former employees and the ones that they have now.  As of February 2008, the site plans to offer a &#8220;premium access&#8221; accounts. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0001/3427/13427v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/3427/13427v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/3427/13427v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Coworkers.com","permalink":"coworkers-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Clay","permalink":"jonathan-clay","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Creative + Marketing","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Young","permalink":"james-young","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Checkster","permalink":"checkster","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/3646/3646v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/3646/3646v1-max-250x250.png"],[[405,119],"assets/images/resized/0000/3646/3646v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":null,"zip_code":"10019","city":"","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.767192,"longitude":-73.99181}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
