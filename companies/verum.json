The result is the ASD:Suite, Verumâ€™s unique, general purpose, software development CAD platform. \nThe ASD:Suite applies proven mathematical techniques that enable software engineers to build better, more complex software while delivering a net 30%-50% reduction in software development costs and a corresponding decrease in time to market. \nBased on Verumâ€™s patented Analytical Software Design (ASD) technology, the ASD:Suite marks a milestone in the evolution of embedded software design and development. In addition, it is easy to use and accessible to any software developer through the Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Positioning</p>\n\n<p>The ASD:Suite is a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution that offers efficiency improvements during the requirements, architecture, design, and coding stages of a productâ€™s lifecycle. It enables rapid and iterative product development, speeding the process of turning customer requirements into the right product. Additionally, the ASD:Suite makes product testing easier and eliminates much of the rework inherent in conventional approaches to software development. The ASD:Suite can integrate with existing software development environments and it is compatible with Six Sigma methodology and complementary to the CMMI-SE framework.</p>\n\n<p>The ASD:Suite</p>\n\n<p>The ASD:Suite gives customers the power to design and build quality software systems in less time and with greater precision than conventional software development tools. With the ASD:Suite, designers can easily and fully automatically verify their designs at any point in the development process to ensure that all functional software requirements are being satisfied. Unlike conventional techniques that cannot replicate all test cases, the ASD:Suite mathematically verifies all possible execution scenarios and ensures the generation of defect-free code first time, every time. </p>\n\n<p>With the ASD:Suite software architects and designers can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Realize complex system requirements with justified confidence</li>\n<li>Flawlessly design highly concurrent, communicating systems</li>\n<li>Spend more time on design, less time fixing defects</li>\n<li>Improve scalability and reuse with component-based technology</li>\n<li>Automatically generate defect free code</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Business managers benefit from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced software engineering costs (30%-50%)</li>\n<li>Faster development cycles, tighter coupling to customer requirements</li>\n<li>Shorter time to market</li>\n<li>Lower maintenance costs</li>\n<li>Increased ability to reuse software components</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the Cloud</p>\n\n<p>The ASD:Suite is implemented as a Cloud Computing/SaaS application. ASD technology uses a comprehensive, brute force approach to software design verification and is therefore hosted on powerful servers, shared by all Verum customers. This approach has many benefits for Verum and its customers in terms of scalability, cost reduction and management information.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[137,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9977/139977v2-max-150x150.png"],[[152,166],"assets/images/resized/0013/9977/139977v2-max-250x250.png"],[[152,166],"assets/images/resized/0013/9977/139977v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Howe","permalink":"robert-howe","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Guy","last_name":"Broadfoot","permalink":"guy-broadfoot","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head IP & Research","person":{"first_name":"Philippa","last_name":"Hopcroft","permalink":"philippa-hopcroft","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Verum","address1":"Laan van Diepenvoorde 32","address2":"","zip_code":"5582 LA","city":"Waalre","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.verum.com/company/news-and-press/11-07-04/FEI_signs_multi-year_contract_for_global_use_of_the_ASD_Suite.aspx","title":"FEI signs multi-year contract for global use of the ASD:Suite"}]}
