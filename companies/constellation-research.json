Our research analysts start by understanding the business objective, applying real world experience and insights, and then incorporating disruptive technologies and innovative business models as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>We cater to board of directors, c-suite executives, and line of business leaders looking for an edge in business model and technology innovation.  We help our clients combine the disruptive and traditional technologies in solving the tough business problems.  Most importantly, our research outputs always provide an insightful buy-side point of view.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to serving you with Insight, Inspiration, and Impact. </p>\n\n<p>Where We See The Challenge</p>\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s business environment, the rate of change is not only constant, but also rapidly escalating.  New business models by upstarts disrupt competitors with increasing frequency in all industries and markets.  In just 10 years, even 5 years, or dare say 24 months, many established companies have been left vulnerable, beaten down, and toppled by new upstarts.  </p>\n\n<p>How come?  Business leaders have been too slow to react to their customers and the changes happening in the societal, technological, environmental, economic, and political fronts.  In business models, products are now excuses to sell services. Product innovation cycles have shortened from years to months to weeks. On the work front, five generations in the workforce disagree on where to work, how to work, when to work, and why to work. Add the current trend of consumerization of IT to the pace of change and business leaders must strategically determine which new technologies should be considered.</p>\n\n<p>Why Legacy Research Firms Fail Their Clients</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the legacy research analyst firms and advisory firms continue to fail their clients when faced with these new challenges. Why? Their myopic focus on an IT centric point of view ignores the realities of the market.  In fact, Constellation estimates that the average IT budget is down 5% year over year and at best up 2% among the most innovative companies.  However, tech spending is up on average 18 to 22% at the most innovative firms.  </p>\n\n<p>What&#8217;s happened? The buying power has shifted and business leaders increasingly take control of how they are applying technologies to their business while whittling down the corporate IT budget for operational efficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>How We&#8217;re Tailored For Business Leaders Seeking Business Value From Disruptive Technologies</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;re business leader and business value focused. Consequently, Constellation differentiates itself in the market in two ways by:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Focusing on the board room and C-suite point of view. Constellation&amp;amp;#8217;s research addresses the needs of boards, CEOs, CFOs, CIOs, CMOs, CHROs, CPOs, CSCOs, and COOs.\nAddressing the business problem first.  Research starts by addressing business value and then applying where disruptive and emerging technologies may play a role.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our Research Provides Insights Into The Tough Business Problems You Face Today</p>\n\n<p>The result - Constellation serves as a coach and advisor to senior business leaders working on tough business problems including:</p>\n\n<pre><code>The future of work\nNext generation customer\nMatrix commerce across the supply, demand, and payment chains\nFrom data to decisions (a.k.a. Big data, analytics, and enterprise performance management)\nTechnology optimization and innovation\nConsumerization of IT and the new C-suite\nDigital marketing transformation\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0010/9341/109341v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/9341/109341v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0010/9341/109341v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Constellation
