While the draft can happen online, many leagues choose to have “draft parties” – where all the team managers gather at someone’s house to hold their draft. Draft parties are fun events, but one thing that can get in the way is having to keep track of everything related to the actual draft – player picks, whose turn it is, auction draft budgets, etc. For years, people have used paper draft boards and stickers (or markers) to keep track of the draft. Using a paper draft board, however, is tedious, slow, and archaic – especially in today’s high-tech world.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why we created PrimeTime Draft™ Football.</p>\n\n<p>PrimeTime Draft™ Football is built on two fundamental ideas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A digital draft board should be simple and easy to use.\nPrimeTime Draft™ Football is designed to be used by anyone hosting a fantasy football draft party. We keep the user interface streamlined so that you can spend less time managing the draft and more time enjoying the party.</p></li>\n<li><p>Everyone should always see the entire draft board during the draft. PrimeTime Draft™ Football dynamically sizes to fit the entire draft board on your HDTV. Everyone can see every team and every round — all the time!</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>By showing everyone at the draft all selections all the time, each team owner can be scanning the entire board trying to identify their next moves. Everyone at the draft can look at the parts of the draft board that are important to them at that particular moment, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who has drafted whom?</li>\n<li>What positions do other teams need?</li>\n<li>What are the maximum bids available for each team?</li>\n<li>What are the average, high or low dollar values that players are going for?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PrimeTime Draft™ Football is the premier fantasy football draft board application – whether you are looking to simply ease the burden of draft management or wanting to take your draft party into PrimeTime!</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve experienced PrimeTime Draft™ Football, you&#8217;ll never want to draft any other way.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/9226/149226v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/9226/149226v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/9226/149226v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"PrimeTime Draft(TM) Football","permalink":"primetime-draft-tm-football","image":null}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0014/9268/149268v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0014/9268/149268v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0014/9268/149268v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0014/9269/149269v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0014/9269/149269v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0014/9269/149269v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0019/8853/198853v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0019/8853/198853v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0019/8853/198853v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
