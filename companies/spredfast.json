While many â€œsocial listeningâ€ services and Twitter-only programs exist, this is the first platform that offers a solution to the execution and measurement problems inherent in social media. Spredfastâ€™s dashboard integrates with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, YouTube and Flickr, and also currently supports Wordpress, Blogger, MoveableType, Lotus Live Connections, Drupal and most XML-RPC enabled blogging platforms.  Spredfast is also able to incorporate support for other blog standards as customers require. Spredfast allows its clients to extend their branded content from a single administration interface to the blogosphere and the major social networks. </p>\n\n<p>Spredfastâ€™s three main features include: </p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Collaborative Social Media Initiative Management â€“ Maximizes efforts by distributing and tracking oneâ€™s content on many social media channels via a single integrated dashboard. Inherently multi-user, this platform allows many social marketers to participate in any given campaign â€“ assign tasks, create posts, and only send out approved content.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Integrated Social Streams â€“ Utilizes the power of social media networks to craft and leverage existing high-quality messages that are both relevant and engaging to oneâ€™s target audience. Through this mechanism, Spredfast enables a user to quickly create content and respond to conversations.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Comprehensive Metrics &amp; Reporting â€“ Measures every piece of content distributed. Every metric that is available through those social media channels is pulled into the Spredfast dashboard. In addition, Spredfast has developed measurable actions to help develop ROI analysis on specific social media campaigns. </p>\n\n<p>Spredfast is currently being used by large enterprises and equally effective for smaller companies or organizations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/7489/77489v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0007/7489/77489v4-max-250x250.png"],[[278,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/7489/77489v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder
