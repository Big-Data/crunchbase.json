No special buttons, no learning, no browser extensions. </p>\n\n<p>Likehack is acting like user&#8217;s friend, who knows what he is  interested in and sends him a link he shouldn’t miss or helps him to recall where has he seen something he need right now.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0019/8742/198742v2-max-150x150.png"],[[164,133],"assets/images/resized/0019/8742/198742v2-max-250x250.png"],[[164,133],"assets/images/resized/0019/8742/198742v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Visionary","person":{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Smorodnikova","permalink":"jane-smorodnikova-2","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Prismatic","permalink":"prismatic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0018/3975/183975v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0018/3975/183975v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0018/3975/183975v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Trap.it","permalink":"trap-it","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Clipboard","permalink":"clipboard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0016/0831/160831v2-max-150x150.png"],[[159,70],"assets/images/resized/0016/0831/160831v2-max-250x250.png"],[[159,70],"assets/images/resized/0016/0831/160831v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarter","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Saint-Petersburg","state_code":null,"country_code":"RUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Russian NewsFeed Service LikeHack Bags $150,000 Funding from Altair Capital","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":17,"source_url":"http://invest-iq.net/2012/11/russian-newsfeed-service-likehack-bags-150000-funding-from-altair-capital/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Russian NewsFeed Service LikeHack Bags $150,000 Funding from Altair Capital","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Likehack","permalink":"likehack"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0019/8741/198741v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,189],"assets/images/resized/0019/8741/198741v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,340],"assets/images/resized/0019/8741/198741v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
