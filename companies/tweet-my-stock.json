If you did, then I am sure that the result would be something pretty similar to what this site look like. It goes by the entirely apt name of Tweet My Stock, and you can use it in order to be notified when the stock price of any company rises or falls beyond a certain value. Should that happen, a direct message will be sent out notifying you of the situation so that you can set to solving the issue (if we are talking about your own company) or take advantage of it all (if we are talking about any competitor).</p>\n\n<p>There is not a lot more to add except saying that this service is free from start to finish. An account is created by merely choosing a username, an email address and a password to go with it. Alternatively, you can sign in using your Twitter credentials. The choice will be entirely yours.</p>\n\n<p>TweetMyStock is an easy application that provides shareholders information of the ups and downs of their shares of stock.</p>\n\n<p>If stock prices of a company rise or fall more than the values you where expecting, TweetMyStock will imediately send you a direct message to your twitter.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0009/2799/92799v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,31],"assets/images/resized/0009/2799/92799v2-max-250x250.png"],[[395,49],"assets/images/resized/0009/2799/92799v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","person":{"first_name":"Zelmar","last_name":"Michelini","permalink":"zelmar-michelini","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"yaguaron 1407","address2":"","zip_code":"11100","city":"montevideo","state_code":null,"country_code":"URY","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.buysellstockonline.com","title":"Buy Stocks"}]}
