The LoanKrunch patent pending expert rules engine compiles hundreds of rates and programs from multiple lenders daily, so the consumer can see all of the loan possibilities, including wholesale rates.  This completely transparent process can be done anonymously â€“ no SSN, first name or last name needed.</p>\n\n<p>Searching takes seconds, and intuitive tools put the consumer in control, and gives them an easy way to filter, sort, and compare your options. Interested in a 30 year fixed term? A lower monthly payment?  Buy down the interest rate?  Once the consumer has found the appropriate loan â€“ the LoanKrunch application process uses bank level data security to process your application through their lender partners â€“ making it safe and secure.  And, when the consumer closes their loan, theyâ€™ll get additional savings (on top of wholesale rates) with flat fee pricing - which can add up to a 50 â€“ 90% savings vs. a traditional loan process.</p>\n\n<p>Securing a home loan is a serious and complicated financial decision, but LoanKrunch helps make it easier for consumers by providing an upfront way to see all available loan options and strategies anytime - all at an affordable price.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/4775/24775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/4775/24775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,105],"assets/images/resized/0002/4775/24775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"David E","last_name":"Chin","permalink":"david-e-chin-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Cofounder","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Wang","permalink":"john-wang-3","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"LoanKrunch","address2":"","zip_code":"92130","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
