DBVu then securely polls the server to get statistics from the databases and these are stored and analysed on the DBVu servers.</p>\n\n<p>The customer then logs into their DBVu account and can view the reports which will be suitable for both management and more technical users who can drill down to view more complex analysis.</p>\n\n<p>The service is aimed at start-ups and small to medium enterprise users who may have the resources and knowledge to install a MySQL database, but not the skills required to scale the database as the company grows. DBVu acts as a centralised database administrator. As DBVu is SaaS, new features, upgrades, etc can be installed without affecting existing customers who immediately gain access to them.</p>\n\n<p>Though there are competing monitoring products already in the market, most of these rely on a complex client install which &#8216;sits&#8217; on the database being monitored. Not only does this require in-house resource to install, but also in-house resources to understand the monitoring tools themselves. These products tend to be expensive (around $1,000 per monitored server).</p>\n\n<p>DBVu is adopting a &#8216;freemium&#8217; model whereby the same thin client is used for all installs and the customer gets access to 30 days of complete monitoring. At any point during the 30 days they can pay the annual subscription and they will remain on full monitoring. If a subscription is not taken out, the customer will revert to basic monitoring with limited reporting.</p>\n\n<p>In future new services will be added such as database replication, back-up etc and even consultancy offered by local 3rd parties.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/5786/75786v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0007/5786/75786v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[330,115],"assets/images/resized/0007/5786/75786v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/CTO","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Robinson","permalink":"andrew-robinson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CSO","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Kennedy","permalink":"steve-kennedy-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CSO ","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Kennedy","permalink":"steve-kennedy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/6098/76098v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/6098/76098v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/6098/76098v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Steve Kennedy</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"MySQL","permalink":"mysql","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/0187/187v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,104],"assets/images/resized/0000/0187/187v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,104],"assets/images/resized/0000/0187/187v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"Â£75k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":75000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":28,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
