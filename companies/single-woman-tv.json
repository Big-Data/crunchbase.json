We donâ€™t offer fashion and beauty advice (other sites have got that covered).  </p>\n\n<p>Get inspired by our Q&amp;A&#8217;s with accomplished single celebrities and notable women.  Our authors and experts will give you advice about wealth, travel, wellness of your mind, body and spirit and of course, relationships - not only with men â€“ but also with your friends, family and community.   We&#8217;re single women too and we know you&#8217;ve got a whole life.  </p>\n\n<p>We also know you wonâ€™t always agree us.  That&#8217;s okay.  We thrive on discussion, ideas and diverse opinions.  So tell us what you think about our programming.  Tell us what youâ€™d like to see and weâ€™ll do what it takes to deliver a channel that feels just like you.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0006/1033/61033v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,67],"assets/images/resized/0006/1033/61033v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,67],"assets/images/resized/0006/1033/61033v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Hyashi-Wade","permalink":"jane-hyashi-wade","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Producer","person":{"first_name":"Kim","last_name":"Kuhteubl","permalink":"kim-kuhteubl","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sales/Marketing Consultant (Fortune 500)","person":{"first_name":"Natalie","last_name":"Grinblatt Epstein","permalink":"natalie-grinblatt-epstein","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Sales/Marketing Consultant (Music/Entertainment)","person":{"first_name":"Melvin","last_name":"P.
