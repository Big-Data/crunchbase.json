Engage.ly focuses on the hyper-local and geo-social aspects of marketing. </p>\n\n<p>Because Engage.ly targets customers by BOTH geographic location and consumer interest, businesses can offer the person standing outside their store a â€œ10% Off Coupon Code.â€  Businesses can create campaigns to target social network users across large geographic regions, or, within a local neighborhood, down to one&#8217;s own block.</p>\n\n<p>The software allows users to monitor and listen, and then, automatically and pro-actively engage in conversationâ€™s that matter. The goal is to help businesses filter out the &#8220;noise&#8221; of social networks and reach out to prospective customers that meet an organization&#8217;s marketing criteria for value.</p>\n\n<p>There are safeguards built into the software that prevent users from contacting prospective repeatedly. This allows businesses to set up campaigns and let them run without constant intervention. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[33,36],"assets/images/resized/0013/1556/131556v2-max-150x150.png"],[[33,36],"assets/images/resized/0013/1556/131556v2-max-250x250.png"],[[33,36],"assets/images/resized/0013/1556/131556v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Sherman","permalink":"scott-sherman","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/1555/131555v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[227,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/1555/131555v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[409,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/1555/131555v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
