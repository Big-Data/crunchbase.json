This provides for a cloud computing solution which allows their customers to collect and work with critical data both in the field and from the office while transparently synchronizing both that data as well as their individual analyses and results.  </p>\n\n<p>Nimobus&#8217; applications are robust to run both with and without cloud connectivity (wifi and/or cellular), interfacing either on the fly or when connectivity becomes available.  Solutions are custom-designed, clean and easy to use yet flexible and scalable enough to meet a variety of customer needs. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0022/3368/223368v2-max-150x150.png"],[[197,47],"assets/images/resized/0022/3368/223368v2-max-250x250.png"],[[197,47],"assets/images/resized/0022/3368/223368v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
