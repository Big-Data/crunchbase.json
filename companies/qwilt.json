Qwilt&#8217;s QB-Series monitors the network for video traffic, identifies the most popular titles, stores them locally, and delivers content to subscribers in close proximity without having to repeatedly fetch it from either origin sites or remote CDN nodes. The result is seamless delivery of most frequently watched video titles in the content originator’s fidelity that is completely transparent to the content provider, network, and user - whether it’s the latest Hollywood blockbuster, user-generated video, or a title from the carrier’s own VOD library. </p>\n\n<p>The company, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., is founded and staffed by veterans from Cisco and Juniper and backed by leading investors including Accel Partners and Redpoint Ventures.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0015/8813/158813v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,78],"assets/images/resized/0015/8813/158813v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,78],"assets/images/resized/0015/8813/158813v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Alon","last_name":"Maor","permalink":"alon-maor","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing, Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Sahar","permalink":"dan-sahar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of directors","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"richard-wong","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0637/10637v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0637/10637v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0637/10637v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$24M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/accel-redpoint-put-24m-into-network-video-infrastructure-startup-qwilt/","source_description":"Accel, Redpoint Put $24M Into Online Video Network Infrastructure Startup Qwilt","raised_amount":24000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":19,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Accel Partners","permalink":"accel-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,162],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Redpoint Ventures","permalink":"redpoint-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/5077/15077v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/5077/15077v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/5077/15077v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Crescent Point","permalink":"crescent-point","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"275 Shoreline Drive","address2":"Suite 510","zip_code":"94065","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
