Users sign up to create profiles, add friends and of course review any business or service they&#8217;ve used in and around Bangalore.  Like Yelp, the idea is that &#8220;friends&#8221; are a trusted source for reviews and they will be the best people to recommend a restaurant, a gym or a hotel etc.  Users are given prizes as incentives to honestly rate as many items as possible.  Impressive profiles will be hosted on the front page and other prolific users   will receive other gifts.</p>\n\n<p>As with Yelp and its competitors, the huge obstacle is getting enough reviews to make the site worth visiting.  For earlier users there may be little value in the site, yet asklaila has received significant funding (September 2007) to grow its presence in the marketplace and consequently add much more content.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1075/1075v1-max-150x150.png"],[[140,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1075/1075v1-max-250x250.png"],[[140,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1075/1075v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"asklaila","permalink":"asklaila","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Kiran","last_name":"Konduri","permalink":"kiran-konduri","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Bal","last_name":"Krishn Birla","permalink":"bal-krishn-birla","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/0286/90286v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/0286/90286v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/0286/90286v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Shriram","last_name":"Adukoorie","permalink":"shriram-adukoorie","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$10M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Lightspeed Venture Partners","permalink":"lightspeed-venture-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/2911/2911v1-max-150x150.png"],[[203,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/2911/2911v1-max-250x250.png"],[[203,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/2911/2911v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Matrix Partners","permalink":"matrix-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0001/8684/18684v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0001/8684/18684v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,215],"assets/images/resized/0001/8684/18684v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SVB Financial Group","permalink":"svb-financial-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0003/0850/30850v2-max-150x150.png"],[[194,57],"assets/images/resized/0003/0850/30850v2-max-250x250.png"],[[194,57],"assets/images/resized/0003/0850/30850v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Kashish Care Centre","address1":"189,190 Kalia Colony Phase-2","address2":"Nr guru amar dass ngr","zip_code":"","city":"Jalandhar City","state_code":"IN","country_code":"IND","latitude":12.971606,"longitude":77.594376}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
