Voice talent can create online portfolios to market their unique services and clients can review those portfolios and create new proposals for services all online.</p>\n\n<p>Buyers needing voice overs or recorded translations have a number of ways to use the Voices.com service to find talent. They can post a specific job description via the Voice Marketplace to request specific proposals. If the buyer already knows what type of voice talent they want, they can use VoiceSearch to sort talent by keyword, gender, experience or location.</p>\n\n<p>Voices.com also offers employers the ability to rank the voice talent and then shows the Top 10 on the home page and the Top 100 in another list. Buyers can select the appropriate talent from the list.</p>\n\n<p>In order to help facilitate payment between the employers and the talent, Voices.com has developed a proprietary system called SurePay to secure compensation to the employees.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/7653/17653v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/7653/17653v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/7653/17653v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Elance","permalink":"elance","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Elance","permalink":"elance","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Voice123","permalink":"voice123","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/5467/25467v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/5467/25467v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,139],"assets/images/resized/0002/5467/25467v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2003,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"150 Dufferin Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"N6A 5N6","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":43.014006,"longitude":-81.280364}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/7867/47867v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/7867/47867v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0004/7867/47867v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voices.com","title":"Wikipedia"},{"external_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/11/startup-cries-foul-at-googles-new-radio-ads-product/","title":"Startup Cries Foul at Googleâ€™s New Radio Ads Product"},{"external_url":"http://startupsquad.com/2007/06/06/voicescom-does-elance-for-voice-services/","title":"StartupSquad"},{"external_url":"http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/061213-232744","title":"Sourcing Voice-Over Talent for Google Audio Ads"},{"external_url":"http://blog.programmableweb.com/2008/06/30/voicescom-an-api-for-voice-talent/","title":"An API for Voice Talent"}]}
