The main focus of myJambi is to connect people and establish a service-based community where buyers can find providers and providers can market their services to buyers.  </p>\n\n<p>Internet users can find any serviceâ€”from childcare to cooking lessons to math tutoringâ€”using recommendations from their trusted network of friends.  Service providers, meanwhile, have a new platform on which to promote their services and build an online reputation. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/3749/23749v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/3749/23749v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,157],"assets/images/resized/0002/3749/23749v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"myJambi","permalink":"myjambi","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Kristina","last_name":"Vetter","permalink":"kristina-vetter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rio","last_name":"Bennin","permalink":"rio-bennin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Huebner","permalink":"david-huebner","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"37 East 28th Street","address2":"Suite 201","zip_code":"10016","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.74385,"longitude":-73.98458}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
