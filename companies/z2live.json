The company builds highly social games that leverage the Free-to-Play model. Z2Live was founded in July of 2009 by Damon Danieli - a 14 year Microsoft veteran - and David Bluhm - a long time veteran of mobile content and entertainment - along with the backing of Madrona Venture Group. Lou Fasulo joined the company in its earliest stages to build-out and lead the companyâ€™s studio and publishing capabilities. Today, the company maintains dedicated studios and technology resources in Seattle, WA for building both mass-market social games along with more traditional 3D multiplayer games that fully leverage the advanced capabilities of new mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>The companyâ€™s first product, Trade Nations, has built one of the largest game communities on mobile having logged over 500 million game sessions since its launch. This highly social simulation / city builder game has garnered widespread recognition and has remained as one of the top grossing games on Appleâ€™s AppStore since launch.</p>\n\n<p>The companyâ€™s second game, MetalStorm, has widely been recognized as best in its category and became one of the top ranked and top grossing games on iTunes within 3 days of launch.</p>\n\n<p>Both games lead their respective categories in terms of critical acclaim, user ratings, popularity and monetization.</p>\n\n<p>Z2lIve also benefits from an advanced community layer that facilitates in-game, player-to-player transactions and highly social game mechanics. The Z2Live community layer supports the most advanced set of community features including in-game email, text chat, voice chat, real-time multiplayer, player icons, achievements, badges and a full social graph that is integrated with Facebook and twitter.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0005/6253/56253v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0005/6253/56253v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,124],"assets/images/resized/0005/6253/56253v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Lou","last_name":"Fasulo","permalink":"lou-fasulo","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Bluhm","permalink":"david-bluhm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/1915/41915v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/1915/41915v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/1915/41915v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Zero260</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"board
