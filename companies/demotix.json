Remember all those pictures of the London bombings, of the Tsunami, of the monks in Burma? They were all taken by people who just happened to be there at the time and managed to snap a picture with their mobile phone or a camera. We are all journalists now.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0004/1337/41337v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0004/1337/41337v1-max-250x250.png"],[[416,72],"assets/images/resized/0004/1337/41337v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Demotix.com","permalink":"demotix-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Turi","last_name":"Munthe","permalink":"turi-munthe","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/0595/60595v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[210,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/0595/60595v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[379,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/0595/60595v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>CC</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Commissioning Editor","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Heath","permalink":"andy-heath","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Tepper","permalink":"jonathan-tepper","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/2533/82533v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/2533/82533v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/2533/82533v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"fotopedia","permalink":"fotopedia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0004/7845/47845v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0004/7845/47845v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0004/7845/47845v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Photrade","permalink":"photrade","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/5503/15503v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0001/5503/15503v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,269],"assets/images/resized/0001/5503/15503v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Citizenside","permalink":"citizenside","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0003/2250/32250v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0003/2250/32250v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,368],"assets/images/resized/0003/2250/32250v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"fizwoz","permalink":"fizwoz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/8133/78133v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/8133/78133v2-max-250x250.png"],[[360,360],"assets/images/resized/0007/8133/78133v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/14/corbis-acquires-crowd-sourced-photo-agency-demotix-after-its-move-into-apps/","source_description":"Corbis Acquires Crowd-Sourced Photo Agency Demotix, After Its Move Into Apps","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":11,"acquired_day":14,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Corbis Images","permalink":"corbis-images","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0014/5420/145420v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0014/5420/145420v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[269,58],"assets/images/resized/0014/5420/145420v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"London","address1":"Newcombe House","address2":"Notting Hill","zip_code":"W11 3LQ","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5105777,"longitude":-0.1243129}],"milestones":[{"description":"Ossie Ikeogu hired as Editorial Sales Director","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Demotix","permalink":"demotix"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/3051/33051v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0003/3051/33051v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0003/3051/33051v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
