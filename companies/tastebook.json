From there users get to decide which recipes they want in their cookbook, as well as the cookbook&#8217;s title, cover photo and more.</p>\n\n<p>The books, which include colored tabs to make it easy to locate recipes, run for $34.95. Recipes can be taken out of the cookbook for cooking and shopping purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Tastebooks include up to 100 recipes.  If you don&#8217;t use all 100 right away, all is not lost.  You will be given credit for unused recipes which can be used at anytime.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/blurb\" title=\"Blurb\">Blurb</a> is somewhat similar, but does not focus on recipes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/1465/1465v1-max-150x150.png"],[[198,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/1465/1465v1-max-250x250.png"],[[198,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/1465/1465v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"TasteBook","permalink":"tastebook","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kamran","last_name":"Mohsenin","permalink":"kamran-mohsenin","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Schroeder","permalink":"greg-schroeder","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"VP of Partnerships & Strategy","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Geary","permalink":"david-geary","image":null}},{"is_past":null,"title":"VP of Operations","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Briggs","permalink":"scott-briggs","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director, BOD","person":{"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"Gansky","permalink":"lisa-gansky","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/2545/102545v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[224,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/2545/102545v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[404,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/2545/102545v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.prweb.com</p>"}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Blurb","permalink":"blurb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[57,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/1327/1327v1-max-150x150.png"],[[57,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/1327/1327v1-max-250x250.png"],[[57,55],"assets/images/resized/0000/1327/1327v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/23/tastebook-launches-with-lots-of-help-from-conde-nast/","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":23,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Cond√© Nast","permalink":"condenast","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/8754/18754v1-max-150x150.png"],[[149,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/8754/18754v1-max-250x250.png"],[[149,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/8754/18754v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":"Berkeley","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.872222,"longitude":-122.268403}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
