Markerly is a highlighting tool for web-based content that quickly and efficiently disseminates the most relevant information in a body of text to your social media networks. </p>\n\n<p>Pinterest allows users to curate and share a high volume of images; Markerly is effectively the same tool but for relevant quotes, comments, and paragraphs in lengthy lines of text. By capturing the localized content, we are able to more accurately tailor a user&#8217;s discovery experience (i.e: a user might be reading about a new mommy-site, but their interest lies with the investment and finance aspect of itâ€”not their promise on finding the best nannies). </p>\n\n<p>Just as Pinterest focuses on granular content with images, Markerly taps into the text portion of the market. All the articles you read are archived so you can browse through your library, or another person&#8217;s library to find more interesting content. Years from now you&#8217;ll be able to easily browse through the articles of interest to you so that you can accurately broadcast your world view (think timeline). Highlight, share, discover.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0019/6506/196506v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0019/6506/196506v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,101],"assets/images/resized/0019/6506/196506v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"Ware","permalink":"sarah-ware","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Patent","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cloudigy Law","permalink":"cloudigy-law","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Added justin Kline as Co-Founder","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Markerly","permalink":"markerly"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0019/6502/196502v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0019/6502/196502v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,219],"assets/images/resized/0019/6502/196502v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0019/6503/196503v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,161],"assets/images/resized/0019/6503/196503v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,291],"assets/images/resized/0019/6503/196503v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0019/6504/196504v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,220],"assets/images/resized/0019/6504/196504v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,396],"assets/images/resized/0019/6504/196504v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0019/6505/196505v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,160],"assets/images/resized/0019/6505/196505v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,289],"assets/images/resized/0019/6505/196505v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/7565/197565v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,185],"assets/images/resized/0019/7565/197565v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,333],"assets/images/resized/0019/7565/197565v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/7566/197566v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,185],"assets/images/resized/0019/7566/197566v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,333],"assets/images/resized/0019/7566/197566v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0019/7567/197567v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,185],"assets/images/resized/0019/7567/197567v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,333],"assets/images/resized/0019/7567/197567v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0019/7568/197568v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,235],"assets/images/resized/0019/7568/197568v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,424],"assets/images/resized/0019/7568/197568v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://markerly.com/direct.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Finthecapital.com%2F2012%2F06%2F15%2Fdc-based-markerly-creates-the-ultimate-web-based-content-highlighter%2F","title":"Ultimate Web Based Content Highlighter"},{"external_url":"http://techcocktail.com/dont-just-bookmark-a-website-high-five-it-using-markerly-2012-06","title":"Don't Just Bookmark a Website, High Five it with Markerly"},{"external_url":"http://www.markerly.com/direct.php?url=http://www.youngupstarts.com/2012/06/20/markerly-making-a-mark-on-the-interwebs/","title":"Markerly - Making a Mark on the Interwebs"},{"external_url":"http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2012/06/20/markerly-goes-live-with-pinterest-for-text","title":"Markerly Goes Live with Pinterest for Text"},{"external_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/markerly-launches-new-social-bookmarking-site-156520525.html","title":"Markerly Launches New Social Bookmarking Site"}]}
