Our mission is to fuel the multi-core revolution by enabling software developers and IT organizations to build higher quality software. Corensicâ€™s first product is Jinx, a tool that will help you improve the quality of your applications when they are running in a multi-core environment. Jinx makes your code â€œunluckyâ€ by forcing hard-to-find concurrency bugs to occur with more frequency while you are debugging.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0004/2079/42079v3-max-150x150.png"],[[243,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/2079/42079v3-max-250x250.png"],[[243,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/2079/42079v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Jinx","permalink":"jinx","image":null},{"name":"Jinx
