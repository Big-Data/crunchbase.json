Raising capital in this environment is next to impossible for a business not yet cash flow positive.  There is still the possibility of a [Plumgood] sale and the institutional accounts are key in that regard.  I don&#8217;t know what I will do next and would be happy to speak with anyone who wants to speak with me about the future.&#8221;  He has asked employers to contact him regarding hiring Plumgood employees.</p>\n\n<p>The Plumgood closure seemed abrupt to many.  Satz had continued to talk bullishly about the firm&#8217;s prospects, until shortly before the plug was pulled.  Not long before, Plumgood had launched new children&#8217;s menu offerings, cut delivery charges, spoken of expansion to other markets, and was banking its recently launched delivery of Purity Dairies&#8217; products to grow the customer base.</p>\n\n<p>With plans to start Plumgood, Satz had relocated five years ago to Nashville from New York, with his co-founder Katie, a native Nashvillian.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the noisy failure a few years earlier of online grocer Webvan â€“ which had raised, and largely lost $800 million in venture capital, Satz&#8217;s rigorous business plan, street savvy and intensity were among factors that allowed him to survive running the gauntlet in the conservative local angel-investor community, then-aborning.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, after each Plumgood funding round, kibbitzers on industry blogs continued to question the viability of a standalone grocery retailer. Their skepticism seemed to grow, as diverse companies such as Amazon.com, Kroger and Harris Teeter began to ramp-up competition for organic and natural-foods providers.  This was locally illustrated most recently by Trader Joe&#8217;s opening in Green Hills, about two weeks before the financial cleaver hit the chopping-block at Plumgood.</p>\n\n<p>Most industry observers seem to believe online will prove ancillary to traditional stores in most markets, with &#8220;dot.com&#8221; still relying on integration with &#8220;dot.bam&#8221; (bricks and mortar-based) companies. Others say online&#8217;s boom awaits only the Boomer generation losing their driver&#8217;s licenses to aging.</p>\n\n<p>Still, locals had hope for Plumgood.  The Satzes has succeeded, it seems, in establishing their reputation for quality and service &#8211; which even industry naysayers concede as crucial elements.</p>\n\n<p>And, Satz has the chops. Prior to the move homeward, Satz had driven IPOs, private placement and M&amp;A for Internet-based businesses within DLJ Merchant Banking, an arm of Credit Suisse. Earlier, he handled financial-restructuring business, while an assistant vice president at UBS, a firm that also has strong Swiss lineage. Satz earned his bachelor&#8217;s in economics at Amherst College, of which Katie is also an alumna.</p>\n\n<p>Although sale of the company remains at least a remote possibility, and Satz has hinted other online companies may target Nashville, Plumgood&#8217;s rapid wind-down signals the what is apparently the first such loss for Nashville Capital Network, for which Plumgood was the first NCN-coordinated transaction. NCN currently maintains a 17-company portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>It is also a loss for Solidus Company, the early-stage venture capital company known for employing an &#8220;evergreen&#8221; investment philosophy, rather than establishing the traditional 8- to 10-year shelf-life for portfolio vintages.</p>\n\n<p>Responding to a VNC query earlier this week, tough-minded, but joyless Solidus Partner Vic Gatto limited his comments to assuring that &#8220;all efforts are being made in a difficult situation.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Solidus has $50 million under management, Gatto said, and a portfolio of 19 companies, including Plumgood.  The Solidus portfolio also includes J. Alexander&#8217;s Corporation (NASDAQ:JAX), which recently described its third quarter as &#8220;awful,&#8221; with the largest quarterly decline ever posted by the upscale-oriented company, and a net loss of $1.9 million.</p>\n\n<p>As with each startup, rise or fail, Plumgood has created opportunities for other firms with which it has partnered over the past four years, including Atiba Software, Point 3 Media, Advanced Payment Solutions, Loud &amp; Clear Communications, Xebec Management, and local advertising, accounting and other service firms, some of which may now be creditors. â™¦</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0012/8253/128253v2-max-150x150.png"],[[160,74],"assets/images/resized/0012/8253/128253v2-max-250x250.png"],[[160,74],"assets/images/resized/0012/8253/128253v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"10 Cannery Row  ","address2":"","zip_code":"37203","city":"Nashville","state_code":"TN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
