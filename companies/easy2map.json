With this in mind, they saw an opportunity to provide a simple online interface that allows any user, regardless of development experience, to create and manage feature-rich, fully customizable, multi-point maps, which are focused on the ease-of-use for the end-user. </p>\n\n<p>Put simply - anyone can now create and embed comprehensive and detailed Google maps on their own webpages. </p>\n\n<p>easy2map believes that such a map making tool will allow individuals and businesses to enhance their online presence with maps that captivate the look and feel of their brand with incredibly useful functionality to ultimately make it easier for their customers to interact with them.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/8989/188989v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/8989/188989v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/8989/188989v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Site Hosting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"www.pagodabox.com","permalink":"www-pagodabox-com","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$25k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"easy2map Headquarters","address1":"Rondebosch,","address2":"","zip_code":"8000","city":"Cape Town","state_code":null,"country_code":"ZAF","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
