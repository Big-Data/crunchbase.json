The solutions support front- and back-office processes in the B2C and B2B fields. </p>\n\n<p>We have adopted a process-centred approach based on BPM and SOA and use web services technologies with their open standards to effectively integrate systems and processes within an enterprise as well as across the supply chain. We have been programming with Ruby on Rails and applying Agile Development techniques since 2005. </p>\n\n<p>To ensure both the quality of service and an affordable price we have adopted an on-site/offshore-centric model for collaboration and often visit our European clients to deliver client-intensive services on-site. We operate from Poland and use English to communicate with our clients.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0007/4304/74304v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,175],"assets/images/resized/0007/4304/74304v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,316],"assets/images/resized/0007/4304/74304v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Owner","person":{"first_name":"Arkadiusz","last_name":"KwaÅ›ny","permalink":"arkadiusz-kwany","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Project Manager / Ruby On Rails Developer","person":{"first_name":"Tomasz","last_name":"Bak","permalink":"tomasz-bak","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/4259/84259v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/4259/84259v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[270,270],"assets/images/resized/0008/4259/84259v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Project Manager / Ruby On Rails Developer at Selleo</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"ul.
