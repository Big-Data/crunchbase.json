Every garment is then made-to-order and shipped directly to the customer. </p>\n\n<p>The founders of TailorMed set out to bring a bit of &#8216;innovation&#8217; to a market they felt wasn&#8217;t fully meeting customer&#8217;s needs. By making every garment &#8216;to order&#8217; TailorMed is able to offer literally millions of unique combinations for a garment. </p>\n\n<p>As posted on their website in the &#8216;About Us&#8217; section, TailorMed: </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Our business was founded after hearing from friends and family that had difficulty finding scrubs that met their design expectations and fit them well. We began thinking about a product offering that could help - and TailorMed was born.
