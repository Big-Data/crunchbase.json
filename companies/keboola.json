We serve as idea incubator - we invest our expertise, time and resources into great concepts and projects, helping ideas that would otherwise never see the light of existence find their way to become viable commercial products. We are a self-funded company, but we do team up with angel investors where needed to move larger projects along.</p>\n\n<p>Our two current projects well representing our main areas of competence are Tracklings (simple user friendly yet technically sophisticated iPhone app for event based, user-empowering location sharing), and OpenBrand (Cloud solution for brand asset management, brand value protection and brand enrichment).</p>\n\n<p>Our strong data analytics background provides us with tools to both help our projects excel and also to help our corporate clients with their analytics and BI needs. We are Good Data solution provider.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0009/5817/95817v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0009/5817/95817v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,141],"assets/images/resized/0009/5817/95817v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Tracklings","permalink":"tracklings","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/5582/135582v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/5582/135582v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/5582/135582v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},{"name":"OpenBrand","permalink":"openbrand","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"founder","person":{"first_name":"Mirek","last_name":"Burkon","permalink":"mirek-burkon","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"founder","person":{"first_name":"Petr","last_name":"Simecek","permalink":"petr-simecek","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"AT&T","permalink":"at-t","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/0875/10875v1-max-150x150.png"],[[159,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/0875/10875v1-max-250x250.png"],[[159,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/0875/10875v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"European Office","address1":"Keboola s.r.o.","address2":"Krizikova 488/115","zip_code":"186 00","city":"Prague ","state_code":null,"country_code":"CZE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0009/5815/95815v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0009/5815/95815v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0009/5815/95815v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[84,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5816/95816v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5816/95816v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[253,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/5816/95816v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
