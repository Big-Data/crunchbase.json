In the course of his adventure, he was pursued by a big question mark (?) symbol. He was caught up in the chase, and as the symbol stuck to him there was a big explosion. He then saw pieces of letters floating in the horizon. It took a while before he figured out that the set of letters spell his name, and the word &#8220;Zeenoh&#8221; was highlighted. People sometimes pronounce &#8220;Zeenoh&#8221; as &#8220;Sino&#8221;, which means &#8220;Who?&#8221; in English.</p>\n\n<p>As you become more curious about the games we develop, the more you become interested to Zeenoh Games.</p>\n\n<p>Join Us!</p>\n\n<p>Zeenoh Games would like to be known in the gaming industry.
