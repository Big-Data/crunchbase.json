A daily â€œOur Pickâ€ newsletter delivers the inside scoop on canâ€™t-miss family activities &amp; special offers from local businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Using a direct sales business model (think Yelp meets Avon), Hulafrog recruits moms as local publishers who manage content and sell advertising, earning commissions on their siteâ€™s revenue.  New publishers complete â€œHula U.,â€ a 3-month training program, to ensure consistency &amp; quality.  All sites are owned by Hulafrog, Inc. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0016/1681/161681v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0016/1681/161681v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,171],"assets/images/resized/0016/1681/161681v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & President","person":{"first_name":"Sherry","last_name":"Lombardi","permalink":"sherry-lombardi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Executive Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Kerry","last_name":"Bowbliss","permalink":"kerry-bowbliss","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0016/1680/161680v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,181],"assets/images/resized/0016/1680/161680v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,326],"assets/images/resized/0016/1680/161680v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://streetfightmag.com/2011/11/01/how-to-market-to-local-moms/","title":"STREET FIGHT MAG: Marketing to Local Moms Online"}]}
