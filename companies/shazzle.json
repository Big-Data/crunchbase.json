Shazzleâ€™s patent pending technology uses peer-to-peer topology to allow users to deliver content directly to a recipientâ€™s browser so it can be viewed on the web without passing through a central server. This application brings significant cost and privacy advantages that we believe will make it a welcome alternative to cloud computing.</p>\n\n<p>Today people routinely buy personal computers with speed, memory, and processing power that outstrips servers of just several years back. Likewise, many have broadband power at home and at the office which allows speed and volume formerly unknown outside of a data center. Shazzle harnesses this capacity to allow users to host and distribute their own content, either on the web or peer-to-peer, freeing them from the reliance, cost, and chokepoint of a central server or the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Shazzle Share allows users to send very large e-mail attachments for free, with no limitations since they use their own bandwidth. Shazzle Host allows users to host websites from their home computers â€“ whether their sites are static webpages or full-blown web 2.0 creations. For example, a Facebook competitor could launch a site from the Shazzle platform using its own computers to handle a central index, while distributing all content along the edge (user) nodes to avoid hosting, power, and bandwidth charges. The graphic included below outlines this cost advantage of Shazzleâ€™s innovation. For those seeking more detailed information we include an outline of the patent application on this method, which is accessible through the link below.</p>\n\n<p>Shazzle users are also able to share their content with private communities of their friends or colleagues with the aid of a group task manager, calendar, polling tool, message board, community and individual chat options, and an internal web browser. Shazzle will soon provide settings that allow work group administrators to control who can access which files, along with file encryption and version control.</p>\n\n<p>Shazzleâ€™s server backed beta version is now available to the first 10,000 users only. All of Shazzleâ€™s services are free for the first 30 days, and in perpetuity for those users that have (or set up) a direct internet connection. Shazzle is available on all versions of Windows. The Mac version is in beta and will be released in the coming weeks. Shazzle can be downloaded for free at www.Shazzle.com.
