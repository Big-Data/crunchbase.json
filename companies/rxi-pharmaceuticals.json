RNAi therapeutic platform includes two components: Novel RNAi Compounds and Advanced Delivery Technologies. The Company has developed a number of forms of rxRNA compounds. These RNAi compounds include rxRNAori, rxRNAsolo and sd-rxRNA, or self delivering RNA. The suite of delivery technologies is comprised of delivery vehicles, which could be combined with various rxRNA compounds, as well as sd-rxRNA compounds, which are chemically modified and have the property of entering cells and tissues to effect silencing without the need for any additional delivery vehicle. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0012/4572/124572v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/4572/124572v1-max-250x250.png"],[[255,60],"assets/images/resized/0012/4572/124572v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Geert","last_name":"Cauwenbergh","permalink":"geert-cauwenbergh","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,114],"assets/images/resized/0013/0816/130816v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,114],"assets/images/resized/0013/0816/130816v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,114],"assets/images/resized/0013/0816/130816v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Noah","last_name":"D.
