The company started out as just Chris and his mother Connie as the first employee, but has since expanded across the United States, and now Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>The online ticketing platform that makes it simple for event organizers to sell, market and manage their events in one place. The system is a lightweight online ticketing platform, designed to make creating events and selling tickets easier than it&#8217;s ever been. </p>\n\n<p>Deep social integration with Facebook and Twitter allows event goers to easily share events they&#8217;re interested in with the world, and event organizers to track how these social shares help sell them more tickets to their
