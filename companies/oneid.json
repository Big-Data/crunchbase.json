The OneID digital identity system is comprised of software that runs in four different places: browsers, mobile devices, websites, and the cloud.  All of these elements combine to provide a solution that is easy to use, secure, preserves privacy, and gives users express control over the use of their identity.</p>\n\n<p>For Businesses, OneID Reduces IT Costs and Creates Foundation for Future: </p>\n\n<p>As more consumers shop online, the IT costs associated with authentication and financial transactions such as lost password recovery, liability from credit card theft, chargebacks, etc., have continued to skyrocket, putting additional pressure on online merchants.  With OneID, the costs and pressure on businesses are significantly reduced.  Customers don’t need to remember multiple usernames and passwords, which speeds up the sign in and check out processes and reduces cart abandonment due to lost passwords and the complexity of creating site-specific accounts.  In addition, OneID eliminates the need for sites to store credit card information for OneID users, thus reducing their PCI liability. The OneID service easily integrates into any website and provides the ideal foundation for developing new online and mobile application and services.</p>\n\n<p>OneID Makes It Easy and Secure For Consumers:</p>\n\n<p>Online businesses deploying OneID can assure their customers that they need not worry about their transaction related personal information (e.g., credit card information) being compromised from online security threats. OneID user information is stored on the users’ devices, which means their information has little to no risk of being exposed in the event of a centralized security breach.  OneID employs a two-factor authentication system that firmly places users in control of their personal, financial and credit card information.  Additionally, with the OneID service, users can choose the level of security they want for each type of transaction, balancing security with convenience at their discretion.  </p>\n\n<p>The OneID digital identity service is currently available for developers.
