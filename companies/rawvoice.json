We knew you needed it; we knew you wanted it and so did we. It just made sense. With simple RSS advances that enabled people from all walks to be heard and downloaded across the Internet, it was really a no-brainer. But it took podcast pioneer Todd Cochrane to bring it all together: a central site, an interface or liason for and about podcasting. And so it was â€” after careful consideration, research and team selection â€” RawVoice was birthed as a company by podcasters for podcasters to provide tools, resources and communities. We make it easier for podcasters to focus on content creation and, importantly, we bring podcasters and advertisers together to make money.</p>\n\n<p>Incorporated in 2005, the RawVoice team initially launched PodcasterNews.com, featuring 5-minute podcasts, and the patent pending Mycast. In a few short years, itâ€™s become much, much â€” and yeah, we will say it again for emphasis â€” much more than that. In fact, after its launch in 2006 Blubrry.com became the RawVoice capstone; a core site for podcast sharing, discovery, publishing, hosting, measurement and monetization. With more than 4,500 podcasts on board, to say Blubrry is a success would be a gross understatement. But weâ€™ll say it anyway: Blubrry rocks, check it out!</p>\n\n<p>You want control, of course you do. We want you to have control, thatâ€™s how we like it. RawVoice has continued to evolve in ways that ensure youâ€™re in control. RawVoice is consistently developing and providing the podcast community a virtual treasure chest of tech tools.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0009/7515/97515v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/7515/97515v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/7515/97515v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman and CFO","person":{"first_name":"Jeevan","last_name":"Padiyar","permalink":"jeevan-padiyar-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/7669/27669v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/7669/27669v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0002/7669/27669v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jeevan Padiyar / <a href=\"http://www.connectorsny.com\" title=\"Connectors Group\" rel=\"nofollow\">Connectors Group</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,108],"assets/images/resized/0009/7517/97517v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,180],"assets/images/resized/0009/7517/97517v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,324],"assets/images/resized/0009/7517/97517v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
