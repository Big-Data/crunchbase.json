With Hiveplay, you&#8217;ll be able to choose the music to be played in any bar, pub or restaurant directly from your mobile phone.</p>\n\n<p>Hiveplay will be available for iOS and Android devices. The process to play a song is really simple: you check in the venue you want to choose the next song, navigate through the venue&#8217;s music library, select the song you want to play, and then vote amongst others. People&#8217;s votes in the queue will decide which song is next.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0020/8692/208692v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0020/8692/208692v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,106],"assets/images/resized/0020/8692/208692v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GV5LI9rdhxs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Hiveplay Presentation Video</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
