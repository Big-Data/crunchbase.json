Forty million screens. Digitally distribute to connected devices everywhere with Yekraâ€™s premium player, paywall and marketing engine.</p>\n\n<p>Located in downtown Los Angeles, Yekra&#8217;s leadership comes from years of experience in the entertainment industry. We&#8217;ve bought films. We&#8217;ve sold films. We&#8217;ve made films. We understand the ins-and-outs of film distribution, and we&#8217;ve built a technology platform and marketing process carefully designed to reduce friction in selling and delivering content. That&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve brought millions of viewers to our films, and how we&#8217;ll bring millions more to an ever-expanding network of distributors and filmmakers.</p>\n\n<p>We built this company because no-one else had got it right. The right solution demands not only good technology, but beautiful technology, interrupting technology. It needs industry experience, cutting-edge marketing tools and strategies. And it needs a local, Los Angeles staff, people you can collaborate with over coffee.\nThat solution is Yekra.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Miles","last_name":"Romney","permalink":"miles-romney","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"Romney","permalink":"todd-romney","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Waterworth","permalink":"lee-waterworth","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Yekra L.A.
