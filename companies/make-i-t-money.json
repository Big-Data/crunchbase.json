Unfortunately, the internet is riddled with half truths and down-right lies on how people are really making money. 8IFY will focus on those elements that you can start doing right now and hopefully start generating a little cash each month from your online activities â€“ even if itâ€™s only a $100 bucks a month.</p>\n\n<p>THIS IS NOT A â€œGet Rich Quickâ€ site. As a matter of fact, I absolutely HATE any claim that says â€œYou can make $35,000 dollars a month doing nothingâ€ â€“ the fact is, yes you might be able to make that much if you hit on something amazing that no one else knows about. But the minute others catch on, your money will dry upâ€¦ 8IFY will focus on methods of generating money for the long run, and hopefully help you build up assets online that produce revenue regardless of the market.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/4370/114370v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0011/4370/114370v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0011/4370/114370v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brandon","last_name":"Corbin","permalink":"brandon-corbin-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/8618/108618v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/8618/108618v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[255,255],"assets/images/resized/0010/8618/108618v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Maddy Corbin / <a href=\"http://www.moiart.com\" title=\"MoiArt\" rel=\"nofollow\">MoiArt</a></p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
