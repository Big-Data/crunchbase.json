In addition to its ample content and e-commerce offerings, the company also provides a monthly sample box subscription service similar to Birchbox, Glossybox and JolieBox.</p>\n\n<p>Launched in June 2011 as the joint initiative of Internet Holding A.S and Ottoman Ventures, LilaKutu generates original video content, Q&amp;As, expert views and articles on beauty tips and tricks, how-tos as well as interview videos with the major cosmetics brands.</p>\n\n<p>While generating vast content in-house, LilaKutu records visitors&#8217; beauty needs and preferences in an interactive beauty profile and tracks/logs all visits based on the pages they visit, the amount of time they view each page, the links they click on, the searches they make, the products they review and the content they consume. All these actions combined automatically generate a &#8216;virtual profile&#8217; which is used to position related products in front of those visitors who exhibit a greater level of interest and intent to purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Based on its technique for increasing the relevance of product offers and promotions on a visitor by visitor basis and succesfully blending content with commerce, LilaKutu visitors discover beauty products as they consume content on the site.</p>\n\n<p>Through its monthly subscription service, the company sends curated beauty boxes to members who customize a profile based on their own needs (skin type &amp; coloring, hair type, eye color, lifestyle, whether they like trendy stuff or classic items, what kind of style they have, etc.) Each month customers can earn points for purchasing products, by subscribing to the monthly service, writing reviews or by simply inviting friends. Reward points can be redeemed off as coupons and discounts to use on full size products.</p>\n\n<p>The combination of customized samples and rich online content creates a virtuous cycle both for the consumers and brands. LilaKutu is about &#8220;discovery&#8221;.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0017/7319/177319v2-max-150x150.png"],[[212,176],"assets/images/resized/0017/7319/177319v2-max-250x250.png"],[[212,176],"assets/images/resized/0017/7319/177319v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Sibel","last_name":"Bilge Cetin","permalink":"sibel-bilge-cetin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Levent","last_name":"Bali","permalink":"levent-bali","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager","person":{"first_name":"Sureyya","last_name":"Can","permalink":"sureyya-can","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Aysenur","last_name":"Yazici","permalink":"aysenur-yazici","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$250k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.webrazzi.com/2011/11/17/lilakutu/","source_description":"Webrazzi","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":6,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Internet Holding A.S","permalink":"internet-holding-a-s","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":{"name":"Ottoman Ventures","permalink":"ottoman-ventures","image":null},"financial_org":null,"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"H.
