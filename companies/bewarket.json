People can recommend products to friends, search for sales on a map and rate users. Social Commerce also facilitates resale, in which users sell products from other vendors and automatically earn a percentage on those sales. The combination of features from both social networks with e-commerce means that users can easily donate percentage of their sales to charities, or are just 3 clicks away from exporting their sellerâ€™s information to fan pages and/or websites outside Facebook.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0021/3898/213898v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0021/3898/213898v2-max-250x250.png"],[[338,85],"assets/images/resized/0021/3898/213898v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Lisbon Office","address1":"Startup Lisboa","address2":"Rua da Prata 80","zip_code":"1100","city":"Lisbon","state_code":null,"country_code":"PRT","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
