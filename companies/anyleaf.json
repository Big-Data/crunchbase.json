AnyLeaf has been <a href=\"techcrunch.com/2012/08/17/19-months-and-1-pivot-later-anyleaf-relaunches-as-anylist-to-build-a-better-grocery-list-app/\" title=\"relaunched\" rel=\"nofollow\">relaunched</a> as <a href=\"/company/anylist\" title=\"AnyList\" rel=\"nofollow\">AnyList</a>, though the AnyLeaf app will continue to be available.</p>\n\n<p>Every day, AnyLeaf scours the sales being offered by local grocery stores and drug stores, building a huge database of all the sales offered. Using a database of historical pricing information and AnyLeaf&#8217;s proprietary algorithms, it ranks every deal, revealing the very best deals being offered.</p>\n\n<p>Each week, it sends you an email that contains the best deals for you, based on an analysis of the deals available and your preferences. When you click on a product in your weekly email, it opens the AnyLeaf website, where you may view detailed information about that product. You are also able to browse listings of all the deals AnyLeaf has found and create a shopping list to help you get organized.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a category of deals that you&#8217;d prefer not to receive information about, then you may hide that category. For example, a vegetarian could hide the meat category. Once you hide a category, your weekly email will not contain deals from that category, and that category will not appear in your account on our website.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, if there is a particular product that you don&#8217;t want to hear about, you may hide it. If you love vegetables, but hate Brussels sprouts, then hide Brussels sprouts and AnyLeaf won&#8217;t show them to you again.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0011/9441/119441v1-max-150x150.png"],[[195,85],"assets/images/resized/0011/9441/119441v1-max-250x250.png"],[[195,85],"assets/images/resized/0011/9441/119441v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"94087","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
