Based in Denver, Colorado, LikeMe.Net is in partnership with the Village Voice Media Company. </p>\n\n<p>As a LikeMe member, you upload the vital stats on yourself and your favorite places and things, which both turbo-charges the websiteâ€™s collaborative filtering platform and activates your own personalized recommendation engine.  When you search, LikeMe accesses a network of people who have the same taste as you and gives you their best recommendations â€“ for the city youâ€™re traveling to, or even in your own hometown.  Thereâ€™s no weeding through a long list of positive and negative reviews wondering whose opinions you can trust, and you wonâ€™t get the same recommendations as your parents, your colleagues, or your third grade teacher.  </p>\n\n<p>LikeMe provides a number of utilities beyond straight search.  The siteâ€™s architecture enables a plethora of discovery loops: if youâ€™re interested in Bobâ€™s Chophouse in Dallas, you can check out the different people who recommend it, or click through to browse other restaurants, activities or spas that those who like Bobâ€™s also enjoy.   And the Facebook Connect feature facilitates sharing recommendations with your extended social network.</p>\n\n<p>The LikeMe Network includes profiles for Guest Recommender celebrities who travel regularly and have extensive lifestyle recommendations, like singer/actress Katharine McPhee and NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne, as well as local tastemakers, like chefs and DJs, who are always in the know about the latest goings on in their areas of expertise.  LikeMe.Net will also aggregate relevant editorial content from lifestyle publications, which will list their Top 10 or â€œBest ofâ€¦â€ picks in Official Recommender profiles.</p>\n\n<p>LikeMe.Net launches with a key strategic partnership in Village Voice Media (VVM), the nation&#8217;s largest publisher of metropolitan digital media.  VVMâ€™s web sites offer definitive coverage of news, food, music and events and have a combined on-line readership of 8 million per month in fifteen of the country&#8217;s premier markets.  â€œFor people like me, VVMâ€™s newsweeklies and websites have been the go-to source for discovering cool places and events, so having access to that content is a dream,â€ said Giarraputo.  â€œAnd since our social search technology allows us to monetize in a way that other social platforms canâ€™t, weâ€™re grateful to have VVMâ€™s experience on board.â€ </p>\n\n<p>The VVM relationship consists of a promotional, content sharing and ad sales partnership.  It also powers LikeMeâ€™s one-of-a-kind Live Music and Events category, pulling authoritative entertainment listings from VVMâ€™s 15 markets and matching them with your customized criteria.  The live music and event recommendation feature will alert you to timely events that fit your tastes and expose you to new and emerging bands, artists, clubs and concerts that otherwise might have gone undiscovered.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the new LikeMe.net service, LikeMe is also launching a mobile application for the new PalmÂ® Preâ„¢ phone, providing mobile access to LikeMeâ€™s services. â€œWe specifically chose to go with the PalmÂ® webOSâ„¢ platform because of its ability to multitask and unique points of integration.  Being able to instantaneously send recommendations straight from the LikeMe app to friends from your Palm Pre phoneâ€™s contact list will strengthen LikeMeâ€™s social search capabilities, providing our customers with more immediate connectivity and more accurate search results.â€ (1)</p>\n\n<p>LikeMeâ€™s webOS application employs the location based services (GPS) of the Palm Pre phone to identify places nearby that have been recommended by people like you and share your current location with your LikeMe friends. The application also enables you to get updates on your friends via notifications and share instant recommendations via the multimedia messaging (MMS) capabilities or email, so youâ€™re never out of touch or out of the loop.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0004/7693/47693v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0004/7693/47693v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/7693/47693v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"www.LikeMe.Net","permalink":"www-likeme-net","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Giarraputo","permalink":"jeff-giarraputo","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3.12M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1427073/000142707309000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D","raised_amount":599999,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":22,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1427073/000142707309000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D/A","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1427073/000142707309000004/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D/A","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":30,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1427073/000142707310000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D/A","raised_amount":2324998,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":10,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Denver HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"80203","city":"Denver","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.755092,"longitude":-104.988123}],"milestones":[{"description":"LikeMe.NEt recognized as one of the Hottest Colorado Companies by Lead411 ","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":17,"source_url":"http://www.lead411.com/colorado-companies.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"LEAD411 LAUNCHES \"HOTTEST COLORADO COMPANIES\" LIST","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"LikeMe.Net","permalink":"likeme-net"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0004/7692/47692v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0004/7692/47692v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,317],"assets/images/resized/0004/7692/47692v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/LikeMe","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheLikeMeNetwork","title":"YouTube"}]}
