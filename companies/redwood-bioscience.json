The Company&#8217;s site specific modification technology overcomes the significant challenges associated with conjugating biologics to synthetic molecules to create homogenous hybrid biotherapeutics.   Hybrid drugs offer advantages over single agents by providing the specificity and half-life benefits of biologics with the potency benefits of synthetic peptides and small molecules.  Leveraging site specifically modified carrier scaffolds, Redwood is developing peptide therapeutics with improved serum half lives and antibody drug conjugates designed to have improved potency and reduced toxicity.  Moreover, through â€œexpanding the chemical space of protein drugsâ€, Redwood is developing heterofunctional products with unique protein-chemical architectures.</p>\n\n<p>The Company is working with partners to enhance the value of their investments in existing programs and to jointly develop novel compounds.  Redwood also is developing biotherapeutics for its own internal programs.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chief Scientific Officer","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Rabuka","permalink":"david-rabuka","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"Boezi","permalink":"karen-boezi","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Operations","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Blank","permalink":"mike-blank","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$300k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.redwoodbioscience.com/redwood-announces-investment-f/","source_description":"REDWOOD ANNOUNCES INVESTMENT BY MISSION BAY CAPITAL, LLC","raised_amount":300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":26,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mission Bay Capital","permalink":"mission-bay-capital-llc","image":null},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.redwoodbioscience.com/news/","source_description":"REDWOOD BIOSCIENCE SECURES FUNDING FOR OPTIMIZED CONJUGATE DRUG DEVELOPMENT","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":27,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Takeda Ventures","permalink":"takeda-ventures","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"863 Mitten Rd","address2":"Suite 101","zip_code":"94010","city":"Burlingame","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
