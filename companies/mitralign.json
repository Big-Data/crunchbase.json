The company is developing an innovative catheter based technology for percutaneous treatment of functional mitral regurgitation. The novel Mitralign system emulates surgical annuloplasty as it delivers a series of surgical implants directly into the mitral annulus by means of a catheter. The implants are cinched together, thus reducing the size of the mitral valve annulus and the valve opening.</p>\n\n<p>Mitralign is funded by top tier venture capitalists and has two major cardiovascular device companies as investors. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0019/0150/190150v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,78],"assets/images/resized/0019/0150/190150v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,78],"assets/images/resized/0019/0150/190150v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Rick","last_name":"Geoffrion","permalink":"rick-geoffrion","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO/CFO","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"J.
