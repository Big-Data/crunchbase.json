Instead of typing in keywords and manually browsing through one or more web pages, technology is ready to accept spoken requests (through telephones or on a desk) and deliver the service that the user has in mind. Pannous was one of the first companies to bring this kind of new interaction to the mobile platform (Jeannie for android). Chatting robot agents that directly turn spoken commands into action are a leap in user experience.
