","created_at":"Sat Aug 18 01:22:17 UTC 2012","updated_at":"Wed Sep 12 21:32:59 UTC 2012","overview":"<p>Organizer is a San Francisco based mash-up of hackers, campaign organizers, entrepreneurs, and investors building mobile apps that make face-to-face contact easy and affordable.</p>\n\n<p>Organizer&#8217;s team believes that technology should encourage MORE human interaction, not less. Closing a big deal? Asking someone to marry you? Everything that&#8217;s important is done in person because face-to-face contact is almost always the most effective way to communicate. It&#8217;s how fruitful relationships are built with the people who matter.</p>\n\n<p>But, face-to-face contact can be expensive. Organizerâ€™s making it easier &#8211; and cheaper &#8211; for organizations to send workers from the office to the field using affordable smartphones. </p>\n\n<p>Organizer&#8217;s first app, Electionear, is for political campaigns and advocacy organizations. The immediate goals are simple: (a) eliminate wasting resources on printing paper lists; (b) eliminate the potential for lost data as workers have face-to-face conversations with voters; and, (c) eliminate hours spent on data entry post hoc. Transmitting relevant data to and from smartphones in real-time makes it all possible. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0020/6700/206700v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/6700/206700v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0020/6700/206700v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ralph","last_name":"Garvin","permalink":"ralph-garvin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Coleman","permalink":"jeff-coleman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Gooran","permalink":"anthony-gooran","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Nate","last_name":"Bosshard","permalink":"nate-bosshard","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Kelly","permalink":"chris-kelly-4","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Lesko","permalink":"jim-lesko","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Bear","last_name":"Kittay","permalink":"bear-kittay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/7097/207097v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/7097/207097v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/7097/207097v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Grassroots Unwired","permalink":"grassroots-unwired","image":null}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"SoMa HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style='text-align:center'>\r\n\r\n<object width='430' height='272' id='FiveminPlayer' classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000'>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowfullscreen' value='true'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='movie' value='http://embed.5min.com/517476375/'/>\r\n\r\n<param name='wmode' value='opaque' />\r\n\r\n<embed name='FiveminPlayer' src='http://embed.5min.com/517476375/' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='430' height='272' allowfullscreen='true' allowScriptAccess='always' wmode='opaque'>\r\n\r\n</embed>\r\n\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n</div>","description":"<p>Organizer Demo Disrupt SF 2012</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
