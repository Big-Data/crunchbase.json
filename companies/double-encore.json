The company has a design-driven process, which it believes results in higher quality apps. The company also focuses on iPhone strategy through a program called &#8220;Start to Market&#8221; which recognizes that high-quality development alone does not guarantee success on the App Store.  </p>\n\n<p>Double Encore is perhaps most well known for developing the 91st PGA Championship application for Turner Sports.   Additionally, the company developed the Brightkite iPhone application, which has been favorably reviewed by TechCrunch, Macworld, and a host of other web sites.  Other applications developed by the company include a series language learning apps called PencilBot and The Bad Decision Blocker (featured by TechCrunch, ABCNews, and CNN).  The company also built the 2nd generation of Liverail&#8217;s SDK for iPhone which allows app developers to monetize their apps via embedded video pre-roll.</p>\n\n<p>Double Encore was founded in late June 2008 by technology entrepreneur Dan Burcaw who is most well known for co-founding Terra Soft Solutions, Inc., an Apple business partner that provided open source and Linux-based high performance computing solutions and created the Yellow Dog distribution for PowerPC microprocessors.</p>\n\n<p>In May 2009, the company announced that in the first 10 months of operation it has shipped 19 app releases, which is an average of one every 16 days.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/9498/29498v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0002/9498/29498v7-max-250x250.png"],[[270,170],"assets/images/resized/0002/9498/29498v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Burcaw","permalink":"dan-burcaw","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9556/29556v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,208],"assets/images/resized/0002/9556/29556v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,208],"assets/images/resized/0002/9556/29556v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Graves","permalink":"jay-graves-2","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Design Officer","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Wiskus","permalink":"dave-wiskus","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$25k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Private","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash_and_stock","source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/double-encore-completes-acquisition-of-iphone-application-studio-90732579.html","source_description":"Double Encore Completes Acquisition of iPhone Application Studio","acquired_year":2010,"acquired_month":4,"acquired_day":7,"company":{"name":"Massively Overrated","permalink":"massively-overrated","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0005/7667/57667v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,118],"assets/images/resized/0005/7667/57667v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,212],"assets/images/resized/0005/7667/57667v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"offices":[{"description":"Double Encore, Inc","address1":"2040 Larimer Street","address2":"","zip_code":"80205","city":"Denver","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.69263,"longitude":-104.955012}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.macobserver.com/article/2008/07/28.5.shtml","title":"Double Encore - The Manhattan Project for iPhone Development"},{"external_url":"http://www.ipodobserver.com/story/36699","title":"Double Encore, the Manhattan Project for iPhone Development"},{"external_url":"http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how_to_succeed_in_apples_app_store/","title":"How to Success on Apple's App Store"},{"external_url":"http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tmo_interviews_double_encore_boosting_the_nextgen_iphone_developers/","title":"TMO Interviews Double Encore: Boosting the Nextgen iPhone Developers"}]}
