This business intelligence is fully configurable, and frees management from having to constantly keep tabs on the ever shifting landscape of their day-to-day business activity, allowing them to focus on higher value business development.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0011/7760/117760v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,185],"assets/images/resized/0011/7760/117760v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,333],"assets/images/resized/0011/7760/117760v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
