Passing a quiz earns the reader points, which helps them level-up and challenge their friends for leaderboard rank. Passing a quiz also unlocks additional activities and opportunities to score points like rating and reviewing books and recommending books to friends. For doing these and other activities, readers are rewarded with digital badges called â€œamuletsâ€ which appear on their Pocket Tales bookshelf.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0009/6756/96756v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0009/6756/96756v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,335],"assets/images/resized/0009/6756/96756v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Brennan","last_name":"Knotts","permalink":"brennan-knotts","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Yaw","last_name":"Aning","permalink":"yaw-aning","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Designer","person":{"first_name":"Amma","last_name":"Aning","permalink":"amma-aning","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Startl","permalink":"startl","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0017/0218/170218v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0017/0218/170218v2-max-250x250.png"],[[278,100],"assets/images/resized/0017/0218/170218v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"DreamIt Ventures","permalink":"dreamit-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
