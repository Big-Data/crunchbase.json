Regulatory bodies and organizations are clamoring for better control and monitoring over their valuable information. At the same time, the Internet and the advent of products such as the PDF file, are making document distribution easier, but less secure.</p>\n\n<p>The Vuzit family of products addresses these needs, with products built for the small business as well as the multinational giant.  The Vuzit DocuPub Platform is a robust, standards-based set of APIs, Web Services and libraries that enable you to embed over 40 different file types in your website or application. The Vuzit Platform contains dozens of features to help control how documents and content are accessed online.  Vuzit SecureVu, available mid-2009, allows you superior distribution control over documents in and out of the corporate firewall.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/1888/11888v1-max-150x150.png"],[[172,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/1888/11888v1-max-250x250.png"],[[172,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/1888/11888v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Vuzit DocuPub Platform","permalink":"vuzit-docupub-platform","image":null},{"name":"Vuzit SecureVu","permalink":"vuzit-securevu","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brent","last_name":"Matzelle","permalink":"brent-matzelle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/4615/94615v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[129,176],"assets/images/resized/0009/4615/94615v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[129,176],"assets/images/resized/0009/4615/94615v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":null,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Cera","permalink":"chris-cera","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$355k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/04/dreamit-incubator-holds-funding-day-to-commemorate-first-graduating-class/","source_description":"DreamIt Incubator Holds Funding Day To Commemorate First Graduating Class","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"DreamIt Ventures","permalink":"dreamit-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/7773/27773v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs058/1101008208242/archive/1102454458791.html","source_description":"Robin Hood Ventures Invests in Vuzit","raised_amount":275000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":22,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Robin Hood Ventures","permalink":"robin-hood-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/7727/57727v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0005/7727/57727v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7727/57727v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Friends & family round","raised_amount":50000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3701 Market Street","address2":"4th Floor","zip_code":"19104","city":"Philadelphia","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.9564403,"longitude":-75.1961715}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"327\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1916243&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1916243&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"327\"></embed></object><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/1916243\">Meet Vuzit!</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user820888\">DreamIt Ventures</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Production Description</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://vuzit.com/","title":"Vuzit home page"},{"external_url":"http://blog.vuzit.com/","title":"Vuzit blog"}]}
