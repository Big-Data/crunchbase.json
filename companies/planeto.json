The company was founded in 2009 by Martin Walfisz and Magnus Robertsson, with the goal of becoming the worldâ€™s leading developer of quiz and trivia experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Planeto provides an exciting quiz experience unlike anything before it. For the many millions of quiz fans around the world, Planeto Quiz offers a completely unique experience that is very easy to learn but hard to master. Players can decide take on quiz challenges alone â€“ playing against the game itself â€“ or together with their friends in the many different multiplayer modes available.</p>\n\n<p>â€œWith Planeto Quiz we decided to take the most fun and popular aspects of online role-playing games, but package them for a global, casual audience. In our game there is no need to run around wielding a sword and killing orcs,â€ said Martin Walfisz, founder of Planeto. â€œWorld of Warcraft and similar games are great fun but mainly cater to a niche audience interested in fantasy role-playing. Planeto Quiz gives our players the same depth, but in a much more accessible and inclusive environment.â€</p>\n\n<p>Planeto Quiz is a free-to-play service and will initially be available as a web game, and eventually for mobile platforms and consoles. Players can decide to play without creating an account, or login with their FacebookÂ®, MySpaceÂ®, GoogleÂ® or OpenIDÂ® account, as well as create their own unique Planeto account. Planeto Quiz is designed to be available to everyone â€“ male and female, young and old â€“ across the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Planeto Quiz dramatically enhances the traditional quiz experience, giving players a unique, tremendously fun and long-lasting game experience. In addition, Planeto Quiz also inherently provides a great learning platform to all its users. There has never been a better way to have fun and learn new things at the same time.\nPlaneto Quiz is currently in closed beta testing and interested users are welcome to apply for participation at www.planeto.com. Additional information is continuously distributed at facebook.com/planeto and blog.planeto.com.</p>\n\n<p>Martin Walfisz is the founder and former CEO of Massive EntertainmentÂ®, one of the worldâ€™s premier PC game development studios recently acquired by Ubisoft EntertainmentÂ®. During his twelve years as head of Massive EntertainmentÂ® he gained tremendous experiences in game production, design and marketing, which is now put to good use at Planeto.</p>\n\n<p>PRESS CONTACT\nJoakim Jardenberg\njoakim@planeto.com\n+46-735 18 77 00</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0006/6561/66561v4-max-150x150.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0006/6561/66561v4-max-250x250.png"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0006/6561/66561v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"Walfisz","permalink":"martin-walfisz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Magnus","last_name":"Robertsson","permalink":"magnus-robertsson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor/Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Joakim","last_name":"Jardenberg","permalink":"joakim-jardenberg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6269/16269v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/6269/16269v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[410,410],"assets/images/resized/0001/6269/16269v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Charlotte StrÃ¶mwall</p>"}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
