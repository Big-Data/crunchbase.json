The most important thing is to have each question page become the best possible resource for someone who wants to know about the question.</p>\n\n<p>One way you can think of it is as a cache for the research that people do looking things up on the web and asking other people. Eventually, when you see a link to a question page on Quora, your feeling should be: &#8220;Oh, great! That&#8217;s going to have all the information I want about that.&#8221; It&#8217;s also a place where new stuff&#8211;that no one has written about yet&#8211;can get pulled onto the
