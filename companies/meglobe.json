Weâ€™ve, implemented a novel, community based solution into our translation engine to address these problems.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever MeGlobe provides a translation that is incorrect, users have the ability to contribute and make edits to the translations themselves. These contributions are used to improve translation accuracy and quality. Every contribution made by the community allows MeGlobe to better account for colloquialisms, multiple word meanings, contextual influence or anything else that arises during natural conversations or the use of natural language patterns.</p>\n\n<p>This approach effectively introduces a human element to machine translation without sacrificing speed and autonomy and brings us one step closer to our dream of unifying the global online community.</p>\n\n<p>MeGlobe also provides access to AIM, Yahoo and MSN chat networks.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/1010/21010v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/1010/21010v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/1010/21010v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10004556-2.html                                                                                                                                                          http://www.killerstartu","title":"Meglobe on CNET"},{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2008/08/20/meglobe/","title":"Meglobe on Mashable"},{"external_url":"http://www.online-tech-tips.com/cool-websites/instant-message-chat-in-15-different-languages/","title":"Meglobe Review"}]}
