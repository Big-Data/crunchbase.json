The Health Guru content library has over 2,250 videos covering 100+ health conditions. The videos are featured on HealthGuru.com (the web&#8217;s largest destination site for health video), on premium health partner sites, and power the largest health video channel on YouTube. Health Guru videos have been watched more than half a billion timesâ€”making Health Guru Media the largest provider of health video on the web. </p>\n\n<p>Our unique approach to health education was developed specifically for 18 to 40 year olds, and is differentiated in three key ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Category Focus: The health conditions which affect 18 to 40 year olds are markedly different from the ones which impact older people. HealthGuru.com covers the health topics that matter to our demographic: sexual health, STDs, pregnancy, sports health, drugs &amp; alcohol, and mental health, among others.</p></li>\n<li><p>Medium: 18 to 40 year olds are used to an immersive, rich media experience on the web, not the text-centric offerings commonly found on other health sites. Health Guru was created with cutting edge media - like the largest health video library on the web and interactive applications - so we can offer the experience our audience expects.</p></li>\n<li><p>Editorial Approach: World-class information providers know that an accurate and comprehensive resource is just the first step. Creating content that truly engages the audience is the way to ensure that information becomes learning. That&#8217;s why we are dedicated to making our content as interesting as it is useful.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>HealthGuru.com is a FullTurn Media, Inc. production.
