LookLab’s fashion insiders provide three different outfit options (each from a different insider) within the user’s budget along with links to retail sites to buy each piece. The insiders can choose pieces from anywhere on the internet. These questions and responses are available for all visitors to LookLab to browse and purchase.</p>\n\n<p>LookLab is collaborating with celebrity stylists and junior stylists, as well as designers and bloggers, based in New York and London. The celebrity stylists include Alison Lang, Hannah Bhuiya and Doria Santlofer who have worked with the likes of Kanye West, the band Oasis, the actor Mandy Moore. The junior stylists have experience with brands such as Topshop, Barneys, Anthropologie and Marchesa, have attended fashion schools such as Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and Central St Martin’s College in London.  LookLab is regularly adding new insiders from other fashion capitals around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>LookLab was founded by brother and sister team Radha and Suraj Kapoor in 2010 and went live in late 2011. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0016/8095/168095v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0016/8095/168095v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0016/8095/168095v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0016/7940/167940v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,226],"assets/images/resized/0016/7940/167940v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,407],"assets/images/resized/0016/7940/167940v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.businessoffashion.com/2012/05/fashion-2-0-commerce-thats-curated-just-for-you.html","title":""}]}
