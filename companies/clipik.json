The secret: human-powered editing.\nUnlike pictures, that can be used and shared the way they come out of the camera, videos most of the time need editing to be usable. However, video-editing is a time-consuming process that requires creativity, software and patience. Consumers don&#8217;t want to put in all that effort, though - they just want to have a cool video to share with friends and family. \nClipik solves that problem by bringing together the users and a global community of talented editors, while providing all the infrastructure and customer service to support the process.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0014/6748/146748v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0014/6748/146748v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,221],"assets/images/resized/0014/6748/146748v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / CEO","person":{"first_name":"Adriano","last_name":"Blanaru","permalink":"adriano-blanaru-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / COO","person":{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"Lema","permalink":"pablo-lema-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Kartik","last_name":"Hosanagar","permalink":"kartik-hosanagar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Director","person":{"first_name":"Kiran","last_name":"Hebbar","permalink":"kiran-hebbar","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Valhalla Partners","permalink":"valhalla-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/9731/29731v1-max-150x150.png"],[[169,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/9731/29731v1-max-250x250.png"],[[169,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/9731/29731v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
