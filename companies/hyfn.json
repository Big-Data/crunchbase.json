We have specialists in every language and platform to tackle the task at hand. If you need front-end development, we have people who breathe Photoshop, CSS, HTML5 and jQuery. We have some of the most talented Flash developers in the world and specialize in creating rich Social Applications.</p>\n\n<p>On the burgeoning mobile frontier, we have developers dedicated to the iPhone and Android platforms. As for the back end, no matter the acronym — .NET, PHP, Java — our team builds databases and content management systems customized to your needs.</p>\n\n<p>And as complex as some of these projects get, we have made a habit of integrating with third-party technologies. It could be as mainstream as the Facebook or iTunes APIs or a cutting-edge newcomer like Badgeville. Basically, we wield a base of skill sets broad enough to work with whatever you have.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0005/5245/55245v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/5245/55245v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,160],"assets/images/resized/0005/5245/55245v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"HYFN8","permalink":"hyfn8","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0021/7929/217929v2-max-150x150.png"],[[199,98],"assets/images/resized/0021/7929/217929v2-max-250x250.png"],[[199,98],"assets/images/resized/0021/7929/217929v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Morgan","last_name":"Harris","permalink":"morgan-harris","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4405/34405v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4405/34405v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4405/34405v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Morgan Harris</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP / GM","person":{"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Fitz-Henry","permalink":"matt-fitz-henry","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Los Angeles","address1":"1235 Hermosa Ave.","address2":"Suite 300","zip_code":"90254","city":"Hermosa Beach","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"New York","address1":"333 Hudson Ave","address2":"Suite 602","zip_code":"10013","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,102],"assets/images/resized/0012/1902/121902v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,170],"assets/images/resized/0012/1902/121902v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,306],"assets/images/resized/0012/1902/121902v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
