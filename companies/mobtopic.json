Others nearby can easily discover the chat and join. </p>\n\n<p>Our app is different to most others because it connects you with people you don&#8217;t already know. Why would you want to chat to strangers who are nearby? Because you are experiencing the same thing as they are in the real world (a conference, a concert, a football game, an afternoon in the park). Also, being in the same space is often indicative of shared interests (people interested in finance attend finance seminars).</p>\n\n<p>Our app is centered on group chat. Many other apps alert you when someone with similar interests is nearby, but they don&#8217;t facilitate any group communication. Mobtopic integrates with existing networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, so people can see who they are chatting too and who is nearby. If people want to turn their &#8220;transient&#8221; Mobtopic relationships into more permanent ones, we help them to do so on these other networks.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No sign-up is required - users can join a chat by simply choosing a nick name</li>\n<li>Alternatively, they can use their LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter identities in the chat</li>\n<li>Chat messages can easily be shared back into these social networks</li>\n<li>Such &#8220;shares&#8221; include a short link ( e.g. mtop.co/12345 ) which enables others to join the live chat</li>\n<li><p>At events, the chat can be shown live on a video projector to encourage interaction</p></li>\n<li><p>We encourage chats to be public (although closed, private chats are allowed)</p></li>\n<li><p>Public chats are kept forever and are easily discoverable</p></li>\n<li><p>You can also start a chat somewhere else on the map</p></li>\n<li><p>Others can also join without having to be at that location</p></li>\n<li><p>We have an HTML 5 app for quick and easy chat (just go to mobtopic.com or mtop.co)</p></li>\n<li>Native apps with advanced features like media sharing and notifications of nearby chats will be introduced shortly</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7076/197076v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7076/197076v2-max-250x250.png"],[[274,274],"assets/images/resized/0019/7076/197076v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business development","person":{"first_name":"Graeme","last_name":"Pyle","permalink":"graeme-pyle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7342/197342v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7342/197342v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/7342/197342v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Product development","person":{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"Peer","permalink":"edwin-peer","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BuzzMob","permalink":"buzzmob","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/3089/163089v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/3089/163089v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/3089/163089v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Twitter","permalink":"twitter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1854/201854v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/1854/201854v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[325,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/1854/201854v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
