Our technology recruits phone sensors to immerse players in outdoor video games. Bike rides turn into Mario Kart and city walks become The Amazing Race. Players create their own experiences and compete against friends asynchronously. Explorence augments the experience with music, checkpoints, rewards and fail conditions to immerse the user in the outdoor video game.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7459/147459v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/7459/147459v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/7459/147459v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Suprovici","permalink":"mike-suprovici","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Thompson","permalink":"mark-thompson-4","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Gleim","permalink":"bill-gleim","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7548/197548v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7548/197548v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/7548/197548v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
