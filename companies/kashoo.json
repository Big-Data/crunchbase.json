For the startup. For the small business. And for accountants and bookkeepers. </p>\n\n<p>So where did the name, Kashoo, come from? </p>\n\n<p>In short, it came from the business phrase of “making your nut.” (See where we’re going with this?) It’s the age-old month-end question: Is the money coming in more than the money going out? In fancier terms: Do profits exceed losses? And we felt this to be a core pillar to any business, from the independent web designer to the furniture maker to the auto detail shop and everything in between. “Making your nut” is what it’s all about; it means you’re in business.</p>\n\n<p>Once we latched onto the “making your nut” idea, we then set about working our way through the world’s official nut catalog* to find the perfect match. While we love macadamias, almonds, walnuts—even the tried and true peanut—the cashew stood out, for reasons beyond deliciousness. </p>\n\n<p>A few creative liberties later, Kashoo was born. And instead of making snacking delightful, Kashoo makes accounting delightful with simple, cloud software accessible anytime, anywhere via the web app and the Kashoo iPad app**. From invoice generation to transaction management to report generation, Kashoo makes managing your business simple and straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>Kashoo&#8217;s 13-person team, led by CEO Jim Secord, is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and is funded by private investment from FBC, Canada&#8217;s largest small business tax preparation and planning firm. There are over 40,000 businesses - spread over 150 countries - using Kashoo and the Kashoo app is the most downloaded accounting iPad app in the AppStore.</p>\n\n<p>*This catalog does not, in fact, exist. But if you find one, take a picture and send it to us.\n**The Kashoo iPad app is the AppStore’s most downloaded accounting iPad app.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0019/8993/198993v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/8993/198993v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,202],"assets/images/resized/0019/8993/198993v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Secord","permalink":"jim-secord","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Chuck","last_name":"Clark","permalink":"chuck-clark","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Pledger","permalink":"scott-pledger","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Dobes","last_name":"Vandermeer","permalink":"dobes-vandermeer","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Zhou","permalink":"desmond-zhou","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/4215/154215v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/4215/154215v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/4215/154215v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Kashoo Head Office","address1":"423-119 W Pender St","address2":"","zip_code":"V6B 1S5","city":"Vancouver","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Kashoo wins \"Most Promising Startup\" at British Columbia Technology Industry Association's Tech Impact Awards","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"https://www.kashoo.com/latest-news/online-accounting-software-kashoo-named-most-promising-startup-at-the-2012-bctia-technology-impact-awards/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Online Accounting Software, Kashoo, Named “Most Promising Startup” at the 2012 BCTIA Technology Impact Awards","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Kashoo","permalink":"kashoo"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gy2-VNdEN1s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Kashoo CEO Jim Secord Demos at Finovate 2010</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EnLDtrgq-9o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Karl Fotograph &amp; Kashoo!</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0019/8988/198988v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0019/8988/198988v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,356],"assets/images/resized/0019/8988/198988v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/8989/198989v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/8989/198989v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/8989/198989v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/8990/198990v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/8990/198990v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/8990/198990v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/8991/198991v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/8991/198991v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/8991/198991v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/8992/198992v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/8992/198992v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/8992/198992v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/20/kashoo-ipad-app-business-accounting-on-the-go/","title":"TUAW: Kashoo iPad App: Business Accounting on the Go"},{"external_url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/03/01/why-your-next-hardware-purchase-needs-to-be-a-tablet/","title":"Forbes: Why Your Next Hardware Purchase Needs to be a Tablet"},{"external_url":"http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2012/04/02/kashoo-app/","title":"CBS: Kashoo iPad App"}]}
