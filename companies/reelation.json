Through Reelation, each member looking for romance will be connected to other single people he is linked to through a &#8220;best friend&#8221; chain. The key idea is to enhance the &#8220;trust path&#8221; where each friend represents an intermediary link.</p>\n\n<p>Within Reelation, members can not be contacted by random strangers, but only by recommended single relations of their own friends. They then belong to a network where their profile is instantly authenticated. This insures that there are no phonie profiles and makes Reelation a self-moderating system that naturally fosters trust and safety.</p>\n\n<p>Reelation also welcomes couples since many single people meet their significant other through mutual friends. Opening Reelation to couples is a judicious way to develop a pre-screened, high-quality social network.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0285/140285v2-max-150x150.png"],[[221,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0285/140285v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,338],"assets/images/resized/0014/0285/140285v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Guillaume","last_name":"Pheline","permalink":"guillaume-pheline","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business","person":{"first_name":"Gregory","last_name":"Bosq","permalink":"gregory-bosq","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Fontaine","permalink":"eric-fontaine","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$85k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":85000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":1000,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"Thibaud","last_name":"Elziere","permalink":"thibaud-elziere","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3868/103868v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3868/103868v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[406,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3868/103868v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0014/0063/140063v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0014/0063/140063v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,310],"assets/images/resized/0014/0063/140063v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0014/0064/140064v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0014/0064/140064v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0064/140064v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0014/0065/140065v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0014/0065/140065v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0014/0065/140065v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
