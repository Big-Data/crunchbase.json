The Seconds team holds the perspective that some of the best technology sits in the background of our lives - almost invisible - allowing us to complete tasks with minimal effort and distraction. Great technology solves problems we might not have realized we had. </p>\n\n<p>Ya know, making a transaction doesnâ€™t have to be such a nuisance; in fact it can be quite pleasant. We intend to bring that feeling to the greater world of digital payments.</p>\n\n<p>The payment experience should be as quick, simple and intuitive as sending a text message.  The Seconds mobile payment system enables any device holder to send or accept payments, whether through the web, mobile web or a quick text message.  </p>\n\n<p>Seconds is uniquely positioned in the mobile payments space by being:</p>\n\n<p>PLATFORM AND DEVICE AGNOSTIC. Leveraging SMS and the web for payments allows Seconds to be platform agnostic, meaning any mobile device holder can transact with any merchant or brand connected to the platform.  </p>\n\n<p>PROXIMITY AGNOSTIC.  Seconds dissociates proximity from transaction. Unlike NFC or dongle payments, consumers can pay for products or services from anywhere with Seconds. As a result, entirely new categories of mobile transaction&#8211;from rental payments to concert ticket purchases&#8211;are available anywhere, anytime for anyone.</p>\n\n<p>CONNECTION AND COMMUNICATION ORIENTED.  Seconds sits at the convergence of communication and transaction. Not only does Seconds offer quick and easy payments, but it also provides the opportunity for brands to have a conversation and relationship with their customers via the SMS channel.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0019/3688/193688v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0019/3688/193688v2-max-250x250.png"],[[431,134],"assets/images/resized/0019/3688/193688v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Hughes","permalink":"nick-hughes","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer","person":{"first_name":"Brent","last_name":"Crocker","permalink":"brent-crocker","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Soliz","permalink":"justin-soliz","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Seconds","address1":"821 2nd Ave ","address2":"Suite 800","zip_code":"98104","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"323\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7jhGBoZvy80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Imagine Life in Seconds</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/3429/213429v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/3429/213429v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/3429/213429v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
