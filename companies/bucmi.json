We asked the question: why is so easy to book a hotel or plane tickets to any part of the world and it is so difficult to get an appointment with your hairdresser or your dentist? Usually, you need to call them, and they don’t answer the phone, or they are busy, you have to leave a voice mail. Finally, it is annoying. </p>\n\n<p>Bucmi solves this problem. We create an online calendar where clients can check the availability of the business, choose an appointment and buy a service. Our business model works with a monthly fee of 20 euros and a 3% of commission on sales provided by the app. </p>\n\n<p>Our focus is in the everyday services businesses and we are already working with a commercial beta. We have a great reception in health &amp; beauty sector and our feedback is quite good. We have already registered more than 200 transactions. </p>\n\n<p>Our team has a great experience in e-commerce, is formed by designers, developers and sales department. We mark a difference with other apps in our simplicity and a prepaid system. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0021/3308/213308v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0021/3308/213308v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,87],"assets/images/resized/0021/3308/213308v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Bucmi","permalink":"bucmi","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Dircom","person":{"first_name":"Covadonga","last_name":"García","permalink":"covadonga-garca","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main office","address1":"Gran Vía 28, 8 floor","address2":"","zip_code":"28013","city":"Madrid","state_code":null,"country_code":"ESP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.expansion.com/2012/09/04/empleo/emprendedores/1346781519.html","title":"En la red también se vende tiempo"},{"external_url":"http://www.itespresso.es/bucmi-wayra-pablo-lago-start-ups-67368.html","title":"Un dolor de espalda nos impulsó a crear Bucmi"},{"external_url":"http://www.expansion.com/2012/09/04/empleo/emprendedores/1346781519.html","title":"En la red también se vende tiempo"}]}
