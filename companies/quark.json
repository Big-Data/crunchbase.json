Named after the subatomic particle proposed as the building block for all matter, the goal was to create software that would be the platform for publishing</p>\n\n<p>Two decades ago, Quark helped spark the revolution in desktop publishing with the 1987 release of QuarkXPress. Desktop publishing was in its infancy, and most publications were produced mechanically. QuarkXPress introduced precision typography, layout, and color control to the desktop computer, and it delivered those features to designers at a fraction of the cost of proprietary typesetting systems. There are now more than three million QuarkXPress users worldwide benefiting from a new generation of rich design capabilities for print, Web and interactive media.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/5209/55209v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0005/5209/55209v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[367,90],"assets/images/resized/0005/5209/55209v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Raymond","last_name":"Schiavone","permalink":"raymond-schiavone","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0005/5218/55218v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0005/5218/55218v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0005/5218/55218v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CIO","person":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Haggarty","permalink":"jim-haggarty","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0005/5219/55219v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0005/5219/55219v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0005/5219/55219v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Vice President of Sales, Americas, Pacific and Japan","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Benfer","permalink":"mark-benfer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/8485/148485v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/8485/148485v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/8485/148485v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Mammel","permalink":"kevin-mammel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/8484/148484v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/8484/148484v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/8484/148484v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Sales","person":{"first_name":"Laurent","last_name":"Ruben","permalink":"laurent-ruben-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/7686/57686v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[192,220],"assets/images/resized/0005/7686/57686v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[192,220],"assets/images/resized/0005/7686/57686v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Laurent Ruben</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Management","person":{"first_name":"Keisuke","last_name":"Shingu","permalink":"keisuke-shingu-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/6195/166195v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/6195/166195v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[379,379],"assets/images/resized/0016/6195/166195v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Keisuke Shingu</p>"}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Heidi","last_name":"Bramlet","permalink":"heidi-bramlet","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/09/30-year-old-publishing-software-maker-quark-acquired-by-private-equity-firm/","source_description":"30-Year Old Publishing Software Maker Quark Acquired By Private Equity Firm","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":8,"acquired_day":9,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Platinum Equity, LLC","permalink":"platinum-equity-llc","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/3282/33282v1-max-150x150.png"],[[143,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/3282/33282v1-max-250x250.png"],[[143,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/3282/33282v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://www.quark.com/pressdetail.aspx?nid=33&lang=us","source_description":"Quark Acquires Assets of In.vision Research Corporation","acquired_year":2008,"acquired_month":7,"acquired_day":17,"company":{"name":"In.vision Research Corporation","permalink":"in-vision-research-corporation","image":null}}],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"1800 Grant St.","address2":"","zip_code":"80203","city":"Denver","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.745221,"longitude":-104.983408}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0005/5210/55210v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0005/5210/55210v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0005/5210/55210v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
