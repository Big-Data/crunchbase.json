They turned to Fleaflicker, a free, ad-supported service that offers a list of extensive features and options not traditionally available for free fantasy sports services.</p>\n\n<p>Among the long list of features: breaking news and weather reports, an in-depth breakdown of your team&#8217;s positional and roster strengths, a live draft room that advises you of your progress and allows you to get on-the-fly tips from a draft advisor, detailed statistics breaking down points weekly and by position (and also displaying hot/cold trends), and an exclusive trade system that lets users execute blockbuster multi-team deals involving players and future draft picks. Fleaflicker also allows users to import rosters from other leagues, and lets users set up customizable scoring systems.</p>\n\n<p>The site has grown steadily in its inception since 2005, and as of November 2007 boasts 75,000 users (compared to 30,000 a year ago).</p>\n\n<p>Also in the realm of fantasy sport startups are <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/screamingsports\" title=\"Screaming Sports\">Screaming Sports</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/draftmix\" title=\"DraftMix\">DraftMix</a>.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0000/1879/1879v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[210,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1879/1879v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[210,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/1879/1879v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Fleaflicker","permalink":"fleaflicker","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/4036/24036v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/4036/24036v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[276,129],"assets/images/resized/0002/4036/24036v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Ori","last_name":"Schwartz","permalink":"ori-schwartz","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Screaming Sports","permalink":"screamingsports","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/8062/38062v1-max-150x150.png"],[[232,156],"assets/images/resized/0003/8062/38062v1-max-250x250.png"],[[232,156],"assets/images/resized/0003/8062/38062v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"PO Box 64","address2":"","zip_code":"07670","city":"Tenafly","state_code":"NJ","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.916003,"longitude":-73.952052}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
