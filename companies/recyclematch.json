Sometimes they want to open up competition to anyone, and other times their strict qualifications mean that only a select few are invited to bid.</p>\n\n<p>As RecycleMatch&#8217;s SaaS customers grow, we will also aggregate the materials on a global marketplace to enhance the freemium experience for buyers.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0009/3316/93316v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,65],"assets/images/resized/0009/3316/93316v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,65],"assets/images/resized/0009/3316/93316v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder ","person":{"first_name":"Chad","last_name":"Farrell","permalink":"chad-farrell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder ","person":{"first_name":"Brooke","last_name":"Farrell","permalink":"brooke-farrell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP - Development","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Penick","permalink":"david-penick","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Porch","permalink":"chris-porch","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0191/120191v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0191/120191v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0191/120191v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$620k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":20000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Capital Factory","permalink":"capital-factory","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/9515/39515v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9515/39515v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9515/39515v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"RecycleMatch ","address1":"3375 Westpark","address2":"#321","zip_code":"77005","city":"Houston","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Hired Chris Porch as CEO","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":2,"source_url":"","source_text":"","source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"RecycleMatch","permalink":"recyclematch"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
