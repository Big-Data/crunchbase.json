For organizations needing to connect development, QA, and project management, the Tasktop Sync solution provides the only enterprise-scale ALM synchronization solution, built on the industry-standard Eclipse Mylyn ALM integration framework. Unlike previous approaches to ALM synchronization, Tasktop Sync provides real-time synchronization, automated conflict resolution, and support for over a dozen ALM tools including IBM Rational Team Concert, HP Quality Center, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, and Atlassian JIRA.  Building on Tasktop&#8217;s Task Federation technology, Sync ensures that each stakeholder in the software value chain has access to the data that they need within their tool of choice, even if the data resides across requirements management, Agile development and traditional quality management systems.</p>\n\n<p>Tasktop is also the creator of the Eclipse Mylyn task management platform for application lifecycle management (ALM). Its commercially supported Tasktop Dev product line improves developer productivity and increases project management visibility through IDE integration with today&#8217;s leading Agile ALM tools such as Bugzilla, JIRA, Rational Team Concert and HP Quality Center. Tasktop&#8217;s task-focused interface technology shows developers only the source code needed for a given task, enabling one-click multitasking and instant recovery from interruptions.</p>\n\n<p>The Tasktop Dev product line extends Mylyn&#8217;s reach beyond the IDE (Eclipse and Visual Studio are supported) by seamlessly integrating both web and desktop applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Wikis. The task-focused interface technology enables users to switch tasks with a single click, eliminating the need for repetitive searching and browsing for files and web pages.</p>\n\n<p>Supported Commercial ALM Integrations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tasktop.com/connectors/accept360\" title=\"Accept360\" rel=\"nofollow\">Accept360</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tasktop.com/connectors/clearquest.php\" title=\"IBM ClearQuest or ClearCase\" rel=\"nofollow\">IBM ClearQuest or ClearCase</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tasktop.com/connectors/rational-team-concert.php\" title=\"IBM Rational Team Concert\" rel=\"nofollow\">IBM Rational Team Concert</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tasktop.com/connectors/hp-alm-quality-center.php\" title=\"HP ALM or Quality Center\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP ALM or Quality Center</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tasktop.com/connectors/thoughtworks-studios\" title=\"ThoughtWorks Studios Mingle, Cruise and Twist\" rel=\"nofollow\">ThoughtWorks Studios Mingle, Cruise and Twist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tasktop.com/connectors/versionone.php\" title=\"VersionOne\" rel=\"nofollow\">VersionOne</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tasktop.com/connectors/jira.php\" title=\"Atlassian JIRA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlassian JIRA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tasktop.com/connectors/collabnet.php\" title=\"CollabNet TeamForge\" rel=\"nofollow\">CollabNet TeamForge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tasktop.com/connectors/rally.php\" title=\"Rally\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rally</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tasktop.com/connectors/scrumworks.php\" title=\"ScrumWorks Pro\" rel=\"nofollow\">ScrumWorks Pro</a></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/5199/75199v2-max-150x150.png"],[[235,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/5199/75199v2-max-250x250.png"],[[357,379],"assets/images/resized/0007/5199/75199v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mik","last_name":"Kersten","permalink":"mik-kersten","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Product Officer","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"West","permalink":"dave-west","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Gail","last_name":"Murphy","permalink":"gail-murphy","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"McKern","permalink":"richard-mckern","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & COO","person":{"first_name":"Neelan","last_name":"Choksi","permalink":"neelan-choksi-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Barry","permalink":"brian-barry","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"stephen-smith","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Vancouver Office","address1":"1100 -1500 West Georgia","address2":"","zip_code":"V6G 2Z6","city":"Vancouver","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Austin Office","address1":"524 N.
