Jiffle&#8217;s patent-pending technology allows users to selectively share their Outlook calendar with their contacts and eliminate the time-consuming process required to set up meetings.  </p>\n\n<p>Users mark their available times in their Outlook calendar and share them with selected and invited contacts.  Contacts view the invitation, login to Jiffle and then choose their preferred time slots from the ones that are assigned to them.  An automated email is generated to inform the subscriber of the meeting request, and the subscriber&#8217;s acceptance is followed by an automatic confirmation e-mail to both participants.</p>\n\n<p>Jiffle is free for up to 10 meeting confirmations per month.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/7071/17071v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[192,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/7071/17071v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[192,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/7071/17071v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":" Founder and Chairman ","person":{"first_name":"Rajesh","last_name":"Setty","permalink":"rajesh-setty","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/8921/58921v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/8921/58921v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/8921/58921v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":" Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Hari","last_name":"Shetty","permalink":"hari-shetty","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Tungle.me","permalink":"tungle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/7376/17376v5-max-150x150.png"],[[200,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7376/17376v5-max-250x250.png"],[[200,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7376/17376v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Softly Software","permalink":"when-is-good","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/1164/21164v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/1164/21164v4-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0002/1164/21164v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Scheduly","permalink":"scheduly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/5812/15812v2-max-150x150.png"],[[192,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/5812/15812v2-max-250x250.png"],[[192,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/5812/15812v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Genbook","permalink":"genbook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/6416/26416v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/6416/26416v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,90],"assets/images/resized/0002/6416/26416v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Presdo","permalink":"presdo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7685/17685v1-max-150x150.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7685/17685v1-max-250x250.png"],[[143,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/7685/17685v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"440 N.
