Its Beta version was launched in Egypt on January 2011, right before the revolution, aiming at creating the fastest, easiest, and most reliable way for people to get matched with their dream jobs. </p>\n\n<p>The creators of BasharJobs wanted to eliminate the frustration in the job hunting process on traditional job boards. Prior to BasharJobs, online recruitment was both inefficient and incomplete. Job seekers had to search in huge amounts of job posts, with the least idea of which job would suit them best. On the other hand employers were flooded with thousands of CVs for each vacancy, and they had to waste loads of time screening CVs instead of evaluating them. Not to mention that people who work in a job that doesnâ€™t match their preferences end up with low enthusiastic and dissatisfied in their job.</p>\n\n<p>Thatâ€™s why BasharJobs reinvented the online recruitment process and introduced smart algorithms that rely on five success predictors to match applicants with job vacancies; experience, education, personality, location and job preferences. By matching talent profiles with job descriptions we generate a shortlist of qualified, well-matched candidates.</p>\n\n<p>Employers build and manage their talent pool creating a pipeline to fill in their vacancies fast, with high quality candidates that are very hard to locate. </p>\n\n<p>We simply recommend the right jobs for candidates and the right candidates for jobs.</p>\n\n<p>BasharJobs is a product of BasharSoft LLC, the creator of several other high-end recruitment management solutions. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Manager","person":{"first_name":"Mohammad","last_name":"Farouk Ghorab","permalink":"mohammad-farouk-ghorab","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Recruitment","permalink":"recruitment","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Employment","permalink":"employment","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Jobs in Egypt","permalink":"jobs-in-egypt","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$150k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://www.tiec.gov.eg","source_description":"TIEC","raised_amount":150000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"Smart Village, Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road","address2":"6th of October, Egypt","zip_code":"12577","city":"Cairo","state_code":null,"country_code":"EGY","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bwabe.info/?p=2388","title":"â€œÙˆØ¸Ø§Ø¦Ù Ø¨Ø´Ø±â€ ÙˆØ¸Ø§Ø¦Ù Ù„ÙƒÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø´Ø±"},{"external_url":"http://arabcrunch.com/2011/02/basharjobs-less-hassle-to-hire-or-get-hired.html","title":"BasharJobs, Less Hassle To Hire Or Get Hired"}]}
