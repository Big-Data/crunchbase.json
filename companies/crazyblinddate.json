Users fill out a set of questions to help match them to other Crazy Blind Date users, and then indicate at what times and in what neighborhoods they are available for a date.  When Crazy Blind Date has a match, they will text you to confirm that you are still available for the date.</p>\n\n<p>Dates can only be scheduled in public venues, and users are given a dedicated SMS number for 30 minutes before their date in order to communicate with each other.  After dates, participants log on to a feedback system to log any comments on their date (did the person show up, how did it go, etc.).  The feedback is used to try to improve a person&#8217;s match the next time around.</p>\n\n<p>The people behind Crazy Blind Date also run the web site <a href=\"http://www.okcupid.com\" title=\"OkCupid\" rel=\"nofollow\">OkCupid</a>.
