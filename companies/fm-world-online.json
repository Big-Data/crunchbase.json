An organization which changes if it is necessary, curious is to recent developments\nand continuously is aimed at improving the quality and services . We do not work with overtime culture.\nWeekend is weekend and a free evening is also really a free evening. This creates an opportunity for our members, \nthey can work nicely with their own schedule and live a life without boundaries.\nFor us at FM WORLD ONLINE, this issue is a powerful need.</p>\n\n<p>The Story of FM Group </p>\n\n<p>The idea of one&#8217;s own exclusive line of perfumes and skin care products is developed by Artur TrawiÅ„ski (CEO of FM Group) in 2004.\nDuring his quest for the perfect perfume product suggested many companies are applying to work with him, but TrawiÅ„ski finally decided to  do business with his father, which lead the family business Perfand.\nThis company already produced scents, decades long for various perfumes customers throughout the world.\nArtur TrawiÅ„ski saw the price of the perfume of the famous and expensive &#8220;brands were largely determined by the packaging, the bottle and by the brand name. He decided to create competition on the market.\nThese scents were inspired by generally very expensive brands that you already are familiar with.\nYou see it every day, odors in commercials on TV or find them in the ads in various glossy (daily and weekly) newspapers.\nBottle and Packaging of one of the perfumes is more beautiful than the other and the price proves it. \nIt sometimes seems as if the shape of the bottle is more important than the aroma! \nAnd above all the brand name also decides a large part of the price.</p>\n\n<p>The packaging and bottles used for FM products are almost identical to each other.\nThis made it possible for Mr. TrawiÅ„ski to provide your favorite fragrances with 80% discount (compared to the price in the store).</p>\n\n<p>The raw materials for our perfumes are produced by the company Drom with headquarters in Munich. \nDrom is one of the world&#8217;s largest producers of perfume concentrates.\nThis company has more than 80% of production and the market held in perfume concentrates.</p>\n\n<p>Perfume Concentrates are freely negotiable. \nMost of the famous perfume brands also involve their perfume concentrates by Drom and  FM Group is also in business with Drom for their perfume production.\nArtur TrawiÅ„ski has decided to sell the FM products through the MLM System\nFM Group is already operating in many countries over the world (more than 50!). FM Group World is  expanding every year and always looking for representatives who want to have a â€œpiece of the pieâ€\nThe turnover increased tremendously in the 5 years that FM fragrances are on the market.\nThus, for example, the total turnover in 2004 â‚¬ 250,000 and at the end of 2008 this has risen to â‚¬ 55,000,000 and turnover is still growing explosively.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders of FM World Online</p>\n\n<p>FM World Online has been established in September 2008. Shafir &amp; Shifayet Barsatie (former ACN representatives) two brothers came up with this ideal network that offers you a fantastic Life Changing Opportunity!\nTHE CAREER STORY</p>\n\n<p>It all began in 2005 when the Barsatie borthers were introduced to the company ACN Communications. In this MLM Company they had their hardest time of struggle! But it where the times of learning and understanding marketing and the whole MLM concept. Just for you to know, MLM is actually a Master Study at Harvard (the 4th generation of marketing). In these hard and tough years the Barsatie brothers had reached a level of good understanding what business really is and still they failed!</p>\n\n<p>After falling so many times in ACN, they finally quit, but never stopped studying MLM.</p>\n\n<p>And then suddenly, one day a friend Patrcia Numan (former ACN Team Coordinator Up-line) called one of the brothers, she had this wonderful life changing opportunity to offer. Thanks to her Shafir &amp; Shifayet decided to join her network in the FM Group Life Changing Opportunity!</p>\n\n<p>Now the Barsatie brothers have a fast growing network with young and dynamic distributors of FM-Group, and with their company FM World Online they want to offer you the chance to benefit from the Life Changing Opportunity.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0011/7769/117769v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,117],"assets/images/resized/0011/7769/117769v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[448,210],"assets/images/resized/0011/7769/117769v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder ","person":{"first_name":"Shifayet","last_name":"Barsatie","permalink":"shifayet-barsatie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder ","person":{"first_name":"Shafir","last_name":"Barsatie","permalink":"shafir-barsatie","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"FM World Online","address1":"Stoeldraaiersgaarde 22","address2":"","zip_code":"2542 EP","city":"Den Haag","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.fmworldonline.com/webshop","title":"The FM Products"},{"external_url":"http://www.fmworld.com","title":"FM Distribution Network"},{"external_url":"http://www.beautiful-business-opportunity.com","title":"More About FM Opportunity"},{"external_url":"http://www.fmparfumbusiness.webnode.com","title":"FM Perfume Business"}]}
