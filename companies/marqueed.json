Whether you are collecting inspiration for a new fashion line or making final edits to a graphic design project, itâ€™s always better to show than tell. Marqueed was created to efficiently bridge those distances and streamline your collaborative workflow.</p>\n\n<p>Marqueed allows the rapid collection of images, culled from websites using drag-and-drop or our bookmarklet feature, which can then be shared and discussed publicly or privately. In each gallery you can invite collaborators and together arrange, label, annotate, and draw on the images to communicate your visual ideas. It is completely free to use.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0019/7221/197221v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0019/7221/197221v2-max-250x250.png"],[[328,116],"assets/images/resized/0019/7221/197221v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Gowanas Loft","address1":"540 President St.","address2":"Suite 2C","zip_code":"11215","city":"Brooklyn","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"430\" height=\"242\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ZCEqZkE81kc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ZCEqZkE81kc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"430\" height=\"242\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Marqueed Intro</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0019/7218/197218v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0019/7218/197218v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,282],"assets/images/resized/0019/7218/197218v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/7219/197219v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0019/7219/197219v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/7219/197219v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0019/7220/197220v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,244],"assets/images/resized/0019/7220/197220v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,439],"assets/images/resized/0019/7220/197220v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2012/06/25/wow-marqueed-could-be-one-of-the-best-new-web-2-0-tools-of-the-year/","title":"Marqueed used for ESL education."}]}
