The process involves distributed manufacturing over the cloud, which helps to enable a strong aspect of community-building around the concept of custom flavors.</p>\n\n<p>The first prototype machine with the uMix technology was a vending machine.  The bottle filling, mixing, and the label printing were all contained within the system.</p>\n\n<p>While the backbone of the flavor creator is the uMix technology, uMix has been shown to be easily adaptable.  Prototypes have been made that include a fountain-type machine, a water-color micro unit, and a unit that can produce a concentrate which can  easily shipped.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, uFlavor allows end users to 3D print a custom designed beverage.  The user has nearly full control over every ingredient.  They also get to decide the combination of the variety of flavor notes on their edible paint brush.  They can adjust the intensity of the flavors, the caffeine, the sweetener.  This design includes a label as well as the flavor choice.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to an online recipe community, users can collaborate and discuss the various flavor blends, however, uFlavor goes an additional step and allows for the blend to be made by a machine in a consistent and repeatable format.  Perhaps, StarTrek&#8217;s Food Replicator wasn&#8217;t that far off.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0017/0504/170504v2-max-150x150.png"],[[158,34],"assets/images/resized/0017/0504/170504v2-max-250x250.png"],[[158,34],"assets/images/resized/0017/0504/170504v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","person":{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"Altman","permalink":"nathan-altman-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Mitchell","permalink":"michael-mitchell-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Design","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Lockhart","permalink":"peter-lockhart","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Sales/Customer Advocate","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Lavoie","permalink":"philip-lavoie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Development","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Mattax","permalink":"bob-mattax","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"6367 Guilford Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"46220","city":"Indianapolis","state_code":"IN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/45266581\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45266581\">What is uFlavor</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/uflavor\">uFlavor</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>What is uFlavor</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/45266581\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45266581\">What is uFlavor</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/uflavor\">uFlavor</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>What is uFlavor</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0017/3674/173674v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0017/3674/173674v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0017/3674/173674v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashable.com/2011/12/09/uflavor-beverage-startup/","title":"Soda Startup Aims To Serve Beverages You Design From a Vending Machine"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcompany.com/1799674/printout-soft-drinks-uflavor-social-beverages","title":"Flavor Saviors uFlavor Refresh The Beverage Business With Billions Of Tastes, On Demand"},{"external_url":"https://vimeo.com/45266581","title":"What is uFlavor"}]}
