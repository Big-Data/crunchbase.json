We believe that integrated Web-based verbal communications are inevitable â€¦\nPhoneFromHere wants to capitalize on this opportunity by delivering instant verbal communications to Web-users and online communities with no requirement for the end-user to surrender personal information, use a phone or download software. </p>\n\n<p>PhoneFromHere.com offers the ability to add speech to any website without users needing to pick up a phone. In contrast to other methods of adding speech to the Web, PhoneFromHere.com allows Website owners to retain complete control over their users experience as they continue to view the Website throughout the conversation. </p>\n\n<p>For any Website owners currently publishing a phone number, 0800 or toll-free number on their website and actively encouraging inbound sales enquiries, PhoneFromHere provides a seamlessly integrated web-based solution. The service includes end-user analysis and custom integration into an existing Website and the solution is browser and platform agnostic.</p>\n\n<p>PhoneFromHere gives Web-users the opportunity to leverage person-to-person speech within the context of a Website. The service has the potential to increase Website traffic and stickiness by enabling a Webpage to become the handset and delivering worry-free, live voice chat opportunities. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2192/22192v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/2192/22192v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,400],"assets/images/resized/0002/2192/22192v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Panton","permalink":"tim-panton","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chair Person","person":{"first_name":"Ilana","last_name":"Ron","permalink":"ilana-ron","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager","person":{"first_name":"Georgia","last_name":"Brown","permalink":"georgia-brown","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Commercial Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"McKenna","permalink":"mike-mckenna","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Project Leader","person":{"first_name":"Birgit","last_name":"Arkesteijn","permalink":"birgit-arkesteijn","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Skype","permalink":"skype","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,110],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-250x250.jpg"],[[315,139],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"PhoneFromHere.com","address1":"10th Floor (Regus)","address2":"3 Hardman Street","zip_code":"M3 3HR","city":"Manchester","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/16/techcrunch-pitch-in-london-the-wrap/","title":"TechCrunch PITCH"},{"external_url":"http://www.bigchipawards.com/page.asp?id=3057","title":"Big Chip Award Winners"},{"external_url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7466708.stm","title":"No Computer for a Day"},{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/Blogging-Widgets/phonefromhere-com-add-live-voice-chat-to-your-site","title":"Killer Startups"}]}
