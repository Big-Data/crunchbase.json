(NHE) is a healthcare company that combines medical, software, data analytics, behavior modification, and statistical expertise to develop interactive, consumer-facing digital tools that both improve health and quality of life and result in the creation of health behavior data.  </p>\n\n<p>Health data is extremely valuable, as it can be utilized to provide better care while helping to drive down the costs associated with delivering such care.  But, due in large part to individuals’ inability to play an active role in their healthcare decision-making, this data is very difficult to obtain.  Therefore, healthcare payers (namely private health insurance companies and self-insured employers) are currently left to rely on data sources that are limited, out-of-date, and poorly transferable.  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, NHE&#8217;s first product is Health Screener, a consumer-facing health self-management platform.  It can be conceptualized as a means of monitoring past healthcare episodes, managing current health issues, and coordinating future healthcare needs.  The principles that promote adoption of this platform are personalization of content and incentivization, and are both enabled by the Health Score, NHE’s overarching proprietary algorithm that incentivizes participation by providing concrete information about the effects of users’ health choices.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0021/9268/219268v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0021/9268/219268v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,263],"assets/images/resized/0021/9268/219268v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Henderson","permalink":"peter-henderson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Medical Officer","person":{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"Carlo","permalink":"marie-carlo","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Statistician","person":{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Carlo","permalink":"jose-carlo","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$30k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
