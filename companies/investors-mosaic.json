We believe that investors struggle with the flood of information available online, often missing the most valuable content or intimidated to even begin the research process.  We solve this problem by filtering information down to “only what matters,” utilizing a technology and human layer to ensure only the best information is displayed on our system.</p>\n\n<p>The Research Center makes in-depth stock research easier than ever as it’s a one-stop-shop for investors interested in becoming more-informed about a stock.  Here’s what we offer:</p>\n\n<p>• Investor presentations and financial data from the company’s Investor Relations page.\n• Webcast, transcript, and Investors Mosaic summary of the last four conference calls.\n• Webcast for the most recent Wall Street Conference.\n• Top 10 company-specific articles and presentations.\n• Top 10 industry-related articles and presentations.\n• Top management interviews from conferences, trade shows, and television.\n• Detailed financial model, including income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>Our platform for investment clubs, called the Report Library, aggregates internally-generated stock research the clubs prepare for their investment decision-making process.  For example, students write detailed reports outlining industry dynamics, competitive landscape, product offerings, and financial model for any stock they propose to add to their portfolio.  Since much of this data has a long “shelf life” such as industry size, growth rate, and competitors, there is no need to reinvent the wheel when beginning research on a company.  We want students to use a historical report in our system as the baseline for their analysis, add incremental information, update the financial model, and upload the new report back to the system.  The goal is to allow time-constrained students to conduct fundamental analysis more efficiently by leveraging the power of cumulative knowledge.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0267/180267v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0267/180267v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0267/180267v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Evan","last_name":"McCormick","permalink":"evan-mccormick","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CTO","person":{"first_name":"Josh","last_name":"Tucker","permalink":"josh-tucker","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Seeking Alpha","permalink":"seekingalpha","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/3421/3421v3-max-150x150.png"],[[229,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/3421/3421v3-max-250x250.png"],[[229,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/3421/3421v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Wikinvest","permalink":"wikinvest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/1102/1102v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/1102/1102v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/1102/1102v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Guru Finder","permalink":"guru-finder","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"Covestor","permalink":"covestor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4453/4453v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/4453/4453v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0000/4453/4453v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"StockTwits","permalink":"stocktwits","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/1903/31903v1-max-150x150.png"],[[238,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1903/31903v1-max-250x250.png"],[[238,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1903/31903v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Estimize","permalink":"estimize","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0013/8753/138753v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0013/8753/138753v8-max-250x250.png"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0013/8753/138753v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0018/0262/180262v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0018/0262/180262v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,294],"assets/images/resized/0018/0262/180262v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0018/0263/180263v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,164],"assets/images/resized/0018/0263/180263v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,295],"assets/images/resized/0018/0263/180263v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0018/0264/180264v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,155],"assets/images/resized/0018/0264/180264v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,279],"assets/images/resized/0018/0264/180264v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0018/0265/180265v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,149],"assets/images/resized/0018/0265/180265v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,269],"assets/images/resized/0018/0265/180265v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0018/0266/180266v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0018/0266/180266v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,335],"assets/images/resized/0018/0266/180266v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
