Starting as early as November 2000, it presents product and price information from around the internet retailers to help shoppers make more informed buying decisions. From consumer technolgy products to baby goods, shoppers can compare prices of a large selection of products as well as learning about different prices based on different pricing options, an important feature in local retailing.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to its proprietary crawl &amp; classification technology, akakce is one of the most -if not the most- frequently updated comparison shopping sites worldwide. Prices are updated up to 12 times daily, and for certain products, prices are updated on an hourly basis. This frequent update of prices enables to keep up with the very dynamic nature of consumer pricing, another important feature specific to the country.  </p>\n\n<p>Directly translated akakce means &#8220;white coin&#8221; used in Ottoman times, but the real meaning comes from a common Turkish saying, stating that everyone needs to &#8220;save money for unforeseen future&#8221;.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/2811/22811v3-max-150x150.png"],[[102,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/2811/22811v3-max-250x250.png"],[[102,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/2811/22811v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
