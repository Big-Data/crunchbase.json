International brands struggle with poor user experience because differences in the product catalog between countries result in a deep link for one store typically not working in another. A developer or publisher using a single, country specific affiliate program is unable to earn commissions on sales from international traffic. Also, by using multiple affiliate networks, developers and publishers can&#8217;t easily compare reports from multiple geos. </p>\n\n<p>GeoRiot allows publishers and developers to use all of the affiliate programs for a global brand simultaneously, while also ensuring that each click results in a link localized for each consumerâ€™s national store.</p>\n\n<p>A click on a GeoRiot enabled link is instantly processed in three steps. First, the service geo-targets where the consumer is coming from to determine their national storefront. Second, the service translates the link to work for the consumer&#8217;s storefront and directs them to the best match of the desired item. Finally, the new link is affiliate encoded so commissions can be earned on all potential subsequent sales.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/5496/175496v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0017/5496/175496v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,140],"assets/images/resized/0017/5496/175496v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Lakes","permalink":"jesse-lakes","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Pasichnyk","permalink":"jesse-pasichnyk","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Shannon","last_name":"McGuire","permalink":"shannon-mcguire","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"SmartURL.it","permalink":"smarturl-it","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"mixeeba.fm","permalink":"mixeeba-fm","image":null}},{"competitor":{"name":"glnk.it","permalink":"glnk-it","image":null}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Linode","permalink":"linode-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/0844/90844v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/0844/90844v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[375,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/0844/90844v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Dynect","permalink":"dynect","image":null}},{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"WonderProxy","permalink":"wonderproxy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0021/0374/210374v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0021/0374/210374v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,140],"assets/images/resized/0021/0374/210374v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0017/5493/175493v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,226],"assets/images/resized/0017/5493/175493v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,407],"assets/images/resized/0017/5493/175493v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0017/5494/175494v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0017/5494/175494v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0017/5494/175494v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0018/5279/185279v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0018/5279/185279v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0018/5279/185279v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0018/5287/185287v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0018/5287/185287v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,252],"assets/images/resized/0018/5287/185287v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blog.varialtechnologies.com/2011/09/21/increasing-your-itunes-affiliate-income-with-georiot/","title":"Increasing Your iTunes Affiliate Income with GeoRiot"},{"external_url":"http://www.dailyrindblog.com/affiliation-matters-georiot-money/","title":"Because Your Affiliation Matters: How to Make Money with GeoRiot"}]}
