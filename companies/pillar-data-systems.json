Companies can simplify their storage infrastructure, slash ownership costs by 65%, and increase their competitive edge by using Pillarâ€™s next generation storage systems instead of those from EMC, NetApp, and IBM.\nAfter all, companies donâ€™t have enough budget for transformational projects because they spend too much on storage and infrastructure. This dilutes their competitive edge. Pillar delivers an innovative storage solution that guarantees more than 2X the typical utilization rate, is simple to manage, less expensive to scale, and can save 65% of what you would normally spend over 3 years. Companiesâ€”like yoursâ€”can now invest more in key business initiatives, thanks to the Pillar Axiomâ„¢. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/oracle-acquires-larry-ellison-backed-storage-company-pillar-data-systems/","source_description":"Oracle Acquires Larry Ellison-Backed Storage Company Pillar Data Systems","acquired_year":2011,"acquired_month":6,"acquired_day":29,"acquiring_company":{"name":"Oracle Corporation","permalink":"oracle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-150x150.png"],[[158,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-250x250.png"],[[158,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
