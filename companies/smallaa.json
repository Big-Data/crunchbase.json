Smallaa brings relevancy to existing social interactions by enabling people to follow the most interesting aspects of their friends in one place.   Smallaa in turn creates extra incentive for people to post things about their followersâ€™ interests.</p>\n\n<p>Social networking is not about connecting people per se; itâ€™s a way for us to identify the best aspects of the people we know and use them in a mutually beneficial way.</p>\n\n<p>This is how Smallaa works. </p>\n\n<p>The news feeds in your multiple social networking websites are combined into a single stream on the right side of Smallaa.com.  Everything you post at Smallaa on the left will automatically go to those websites.  When you and your friends post to different topics of interests, you get to pick and follow the most interesting aspects of them on the left side of Smallaa.   They will in turn want to post more things about your interests. </p>\n\n<p>This technology comes from Smallaa Inc (www.smallaa.com), a California incorporated company devoted to maximize the individuals decision-making power with the Internet. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0004/0691/40691v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0004/0691/40691v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,164],"assets/images/resized/0004/0691/40691v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Smallaa.com","permalink":"smallaa-com","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Lai","permalink":"tim-lai","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Software Architect","person":{"first_name":"Pavel","last_name":"Senko","permalink":"pavel-senko","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$3M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Smallaa Inc","address1":"2860 Zanker Road Ste 108","address2":"","zip_code":"95134","city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.39458,"longitude":-121.928393}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0004/0690/40690v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,212],"assets/images/resized/0004/0690/40690v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,383],"assets/images/resized/0004/0690/40690v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc4DD5wjXUQ","title":"Smallaa Inc"}]}
