Anyone can step in and speak up by asking questions or making statements and then voting on the ones they want to be addressed. The result is a real-time list of whatâ€™s most important to the greatest number of people. With CrowdHall, the crowd has a voice that can be engaging without being overwhelming, and those at the top can be efficiently informed and personally responsive.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0021/4009/214009v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0021/4009/214009v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0021/4009/214009v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO, Tech Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Wientge","permalink":"nick-wientge","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Austin","last_name":"Rory Hackett","permalink":"austin-rory-hackett","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO, Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jordan","last_name":"Menzel","permalink":"jordan-menzel","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Brandery HQ","address1":"1411 Vine Street","address2":"","zip_code":"45202","city":"Cincinnati","state_code":"OH","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"description":"Powered USAID's Frontiers in Development conference","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":6,"source_url":"https://usaid.crowdhall.com/","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"CrowdHall","permalink":"crowdhall"}},{"description":"Test launch with Jef Holm","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":19,"source_url":"http://crowdhall.com/jefholm","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"CrowdHall","permalink":"crowdhall"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eHGIpArm-2Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>How Jane uses CrowdHall</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0019/7671/197671v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,132],"assets/images/resized/0019/7671/197671v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,238],"assets/images/resized/0019/7671/197671v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0020/7724/207724v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0020/7724/207724v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0020/7724/207724v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0021/4007/214007v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,156],"assets/images/resized/0021/4007/214007v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,281],"assets/images/resized/0021/4007/214007v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://dev.utahbusiness.com/articles/view/utah_startup_crowdhall_accepted_into_venture_acc","title":"Utah Business Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://nibletz.com/2012/06/utah-startup-crowdhall-moving-to-cincinnati-for-the-brandery-interview/","title":"Featured on nibletz.com"}]}
