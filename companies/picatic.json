Picatic guarantees successful events by eliminating 100% of the risk for event organizers.                      </p>\n\n<p>Picatic’s new feature, EventTilt, allows event organizers to sell a preset number of discounted tickets within a preset date; offering early buyers a financial discount and an optional bonus providing an exclusive ‘perk’ such as VIP access, autographed books, swag etc.  If the preset number of tickets aren’t sold within the preset time, funds are returned in full to buyers. When the preset number of tickets are sold the event ‘tilts’, and remaining tickets continue to sell at full price.                        </p>\n\n<p>Picatic is an everyday solution for event organizers and can be used by anyone anywhere. In application, Picatic allows promoters to be resourceful in selling, promoting and managing their events. Being able to leverage more than one event at a time without the risk of losing money will drastically change the way events are promoted and marketed. Unlike competitors, Picatic guarantees the success of events through a crowdfunding model that disrupts the traditional models.  Combined with the exclusive offers, organizers can engage their audience in new and exciting ways.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/2510/172510v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/2510/172510v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0017/2510/172510v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Brett","last_name":"Ede","permalink":"brett-ede-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Brett","last_name":"Ede","permalink":"brett-ede","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Jayesh","last_name":"Parmar","permalink":"jayesh-parmar","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/1846/211846v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[228,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/1846/211846v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[410,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/1846/211846v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Sapara","permalink":"james-sapara-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CCO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Depesh","last_name":"Parmar","permalink":"depesh-parmar","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Sapara","permalink":"james-sapara","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Picatic San Francisco","address1":"181 Fremont Street","address2":"Picatic","zip_code":"94105","city":" San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Picatic Toronto","address1":"300 639 Queen St. West","address2":"Picatic","zip_code":"M5V2B7","city":"Toronto","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Picatic Saskatoon","address1":"118 23rd St. East","address2":"Picatic","zip_code":"S7K0B8","city":"Saskatoon","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SS7QWNYAS6w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Crowdfund Your Next Event</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[83,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/0587/170587v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[139,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/0587/170587v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[251,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/0587/170587v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/1733/211733v2-max-150x150.png"],[[165,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/1733/211733v2-max-250x250.png"],[[297,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/1733/211733v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,130],"assets/images/resized/0021/1734/211734v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0021/1734/211734v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,390],"assets/images/resized/0021/1734/211734v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0021/1735/211735v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0021/1735/211735v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0021/1735/211735v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eniJ44CUHgo&context=C3d92107ADOEgsToPDskIcXTRHm-ZcU2736zyHvQ2l","title":"Learn how Picatic can help you within minutes!"}]}
