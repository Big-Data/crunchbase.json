The group&#8217;s most notable publication is The Economist.</p>\n\n<p>Edited in London since 1843, The Economist is a weekly international news and business publication offering reporting, commentary and analysis on world current affairs, business, finance, science and technology, culture, society, media and the arts. As noted on its contents page, The Economist&#8217;s goal is to &#8220;take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>Printed in five countries, worldwide circulation is over one million, and The Economist is read by more of the world&#8217;s political and business leaders than any other magazine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0001/8242/18242v1-max-150x150.png"],[[202,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/8242/18242v1-max-250x250.png"],[[202,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/8242/18242v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"The
