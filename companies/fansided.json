The fastest growing independent sports network on the Internet. Daily original content crafted for intelligent sports fans by intelligent sports fans.</strong></p>\n\n<p>FanSided started with Arrowhead Addict, a Kansas City Chiefs blog, back in April of 2007. Five years later, a simple website collaboration between two brothers has blossomed into the FanSided empire — a company of over 220 unique sports websites dedicated to team-specific and sport-specific coverage. Millions and millions of sports fans have flocked to our online sports communities, and we’re just getting started.</p>\n\n<p>Nowhere else will you find the edgy, candid “fanpinions” that the FanSided Network dishes out every day of every week of every month of every year. <strong>Fandom has no offseason. Neither do we.</strong> Sports aren’t our jobs — sports are our lives. We know you eat, breathe, sleep and “you know what” sports. That’s why we’ve recruited a staff of FanSiders who are just as passionate about the teams and sports they cover as you are. Our staff remains dedicated to giving fan nation the coverage it wants — not the coverage the sports leagues and teams or mainstream media want you to receive. You will get the lowdown on your favorite sports and teams on and off the field early and often.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Austin","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"New York","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0021/1051/211051v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,168],"assets/images/resized/0021/1051/211051v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,302],"assets/images/resized/0021/1051/211051v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/1052/211052v3-max-150x150.png"],[[202,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/1052/211052v3-max-250x250.png"],[[363,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/1052/211052v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0021/1054/211054v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,235],"assets/images/resized/0021/1054/211054v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,424],"assets/images/resized/0021/1054/211054v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
