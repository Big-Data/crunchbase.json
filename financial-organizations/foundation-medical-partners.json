Foundation was formed in 2001 with the vision of bringing together cutting edge life science expertise with deep company-building experience. Foundation specializes in early stage investments in the medical device, biopharmaceutical, and predictive medicine technology sectors. Foundation is an active venture investor, providing leadership, support, and strategic resources at every stage in a companyâ€™s development.</p>\n\n<p>Proven Success, Top Tier Performance</p>\n\n<p>Foundation Medical Partners was an early, active venture investor in such now-public companies as AtriCure (NASDAQ: ATRC), CardioNet (NASDAQ: BEAT), Combinatorx (NASDAQ: CRXX), and Northstar Neuroscience (NASDAQ: NSTR), as well as a portfolio of other market-leading privately held firms. Foundation actively manages over $200 million in venture capital, with a current market capitalization of its healthcare investments totaling over $1.6 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Wide Network, Unparalleled Strategic Resources</p>\n\n<p>Foundation Medical Partners draws on a wide network of specialized resources within the healthcare industry and academic medical environment. Contributing to Foundationâ€™s clinical expertise is its unique strategic limited partnership affiliation with Cleveland Clinic. This partnership is a powerful asset for Foundation and its portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p>Foundationâ€™s special relationship with Cleveland Clinic allows the firm and its portfolio companies to directly access and work closely with physicians, surgeons, and scientists throughout Cleveland Clinic. The enormous intellectual and experiential capacity made available to Foundation and its portfolio companies through this relationship is unparalleled in healthcare venture capital. Foundation leverages this to full advantage in deal sourcing and due diligence, as well as in key company building activities, such as scientific advisory board support, development partnerships, beta site testing, clinical trial leadership, or key reference customer development.</p>\n\n<p>Pioneer in Medicine, World-Class Partner</p>\n\n<p>Foundation Medical Partnersâ€™ strategic limited partner, Cleveland Clinic, is one of the most widely recognized and innovative medical centers in the world. Cleveland Clinic is a private, non-profit group practice that includes a 954-bed hospital, outpatient services, a research institute, and an education foundation. As a world-class academic medical center that is a designated national referral center and international health resource, Cleveland Clinic provides the full range of medical services. Cleveland Clinic was ranked in 2008 as one of the top five best hospitals in the United States by U.S. News &amp; World Report&#8217;s guide to America&#8217;s Best Hospitals. The Cleveland Clinic Heart Center continues its reign as the best medical center for cardiac care, having received this number one ranking in the guide every year since 1994. In addition, ten of its specialties were listed among the Top 10 in the United States and all of the Clinicâ€™s specialties placed in the nationâ€™s top 25.</p>\n\n<p>While Foundation Medical Partners enjoys all of the benefits of this strategic partnership with Cleveland Clinic, the firm maintains complete independence from the structural and governance perspectives and operates with the traditional independent venture capital model.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0005/5121/55121v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/5121/55121v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/5121/55121v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"105
