They believe that to be successful in early stage technology companies in particular, investors must bring more than just capital to the table. The founding directors have over 50 years experience themselves as CEOs of technology development and licensing companies. This considerable expertise combined with the financial and VC experience of the E-Synergy investment team enables them to take a hands on approach to investing and leverage real value from the capital they provide.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0004/7629/47629v1-max-150x150.png"],[[234,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/7629/47629v1-max-250x250.png"],[[234,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/7629/47629v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Main
