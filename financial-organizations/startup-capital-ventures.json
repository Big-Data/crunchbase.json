While most venture firms have grown too large to invest as little as $250,000 to $1 million in a financing round, Startup Capital Ventures targets investments in this range. The firm leverages its investment with unparalleled operations experience from a team of five seasoned professionals. Generally, they target capital efficient companies, such as software, that are generating some revenue and can show a reasonable likelihood of reaching near-term profitability from their investment. Their approach is to build a supportive partnership around an outstanding entrepreneurial team with a clear market vision for its product or service. They focus on investing in strong management teams, not just technologies. They strive to build a supportive working relationship with their portfolio companies based on flexibility, integrity, and patience.</p>\n\n<p>As experienced business executives themselves, who have founded and run companies, they know firsthand the hard work and challenges of building successful companies. A hallmark of their strategy is their ability to deliver deep domain expertise to each of their portfolio companies, which also reduces investment risk for their limited partner investors. An extensive network of strategic contacts and their presence in the US and Asia can make a difference in how rapidly their companies achieve critical milestones. Also, the team&#8217;s extensive experience in the financial services industry gives them a special advantage in that investment sector. Their philosophy includes not only a commitment to their portfolio companies, but also a goal of creating industry leading companies for the long term.</p>\n\n<p>Although their primary geographic focus is investments in the United States, they will invest opportunistically in Asia, primarily in China, through their office in Hong Kong. In the U.S., their focus is principally Silicon Valley as well as Hawaii, Texas, and Oklahoma, where the firm has extensive relationships through its limited partner base.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0004/3543/43543v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/3543/43543v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/3543/43543v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Silicon Valley Office","address1":"100 Hamilton Ave.","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.442601,"longitude":-122.162159},{"description":"Hong Kong Office","address1":"Room 2101, 21/F, Westlands Centre","address2":"20 Westland Road","zip_code":"","city":"Quarry Bay","state_code":null,"country_code":"HKG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing General Partner","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"C.
