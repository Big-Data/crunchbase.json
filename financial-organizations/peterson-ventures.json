They invest in start-up companies that often have nothing more than a great idea or are not yet profitable. In general, they work best with companies that have the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Talented entrepreneur with collaborative attitude</li>\n<li>Highly qualified management team</li>\n<li>Unique product / service offering</li>\n<li>Scalable business model</li>\n<li>Clearly-defined exit opportunities</li>\n<li>Low capital requirements to achieve profitability </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Geography &amp; Industries</p>\n\n<p>They are focused primarily on investments in the West Coast and Mountain West regions of the United States. However, they will consider investments outside of this region if they fit well with their investment strategy. They do not specialize in making investments in any particular industry; however, they will not typically invest in pure technology startups outside of a defined business model and a clear go-to-market strategy.</p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/217442/hirevue-secures-funding-anchored-peterson-ventures","source_description":"HireVue
