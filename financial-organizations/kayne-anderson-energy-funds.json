They currently manage over $11.5 billion in investments, principally through private investment partnerships and public closed-end funds as of December 31, 2010. They pursue investment niches where they believe their strategies and knowledge advantage enable us to identify, source and structure investment opportunities that offer attractive and sustainable returns with moderate levels of risk. These investment niches often exist because of complexity, extreme sentiment or investment size limitations. Their separately dedicated investment teams focus on generating returns across a variety of strategies, which include public investing in master limited partnerships and other specialized marketable securities sectors, private investing in midstream and upstream oil and gas companies, and private investing in growth equity, niche real estate and mezzanine financing. Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors is entirely owned by their investment professionals and management.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0011/8520/118520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0011/8520/118520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[275,82],"assets/images/resized/0011/8520/118520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1800 Avenue of the Stars","address2":"Second Floor","zip_code":"90067","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2010/09/newton-energy-partners-receives-75m.html","source_description":"Newton Energy Partners Receives $75M Equity Investment from Kayne Anderson Energy Funds","raised_amount":75000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"Newton Energy Partners","permalink":"newton-energy-partners","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/01/xog-to-receive-50m-equity-investment.html","source_description":"XOG to Receive $50M Equity Investment","raised_amount":50000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"XOG","permalink":"xog","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0014/0901/140901v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,155],"assets/images/resized/0014/0901/140901v1-max-250x250.png"],[[394,245],"assets/images/resized/0014/0901/140901v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
