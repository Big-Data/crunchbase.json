The ECP team combines over 55 years of experience in venture capital and commercial finance to deliver a broad array of senior, subordinated and mezzanine debt solutions that are less dilutive than equity and provide more flexibility than conventional debt from banks or asset-based lenders.</p>\n\n<p>As a company expands operations on a path to profitability, it should also look to broaden sources of capital beyond equity and traditional debt to achieve an optimal blend between cost and flexibility. Escalate&#8217;s facilities are tailored to finance permanent working capital requirements, acquisitions and buy outs.</p>\n\n<p>Given the substantial and diverse experience within its investment team, Escalate can also structure syndicated transactions incorporating equity and debt through an extensive network of venture capital and debt financing partners.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0006/6096/66096v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/6096/66096v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[201,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/6096/66096v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"150 Almaden Boulevard  Suite 925","address2":"","zip_code":"95113","city":"San Jose","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"300 W.
