For direct investments, it focuses on venture capital investments and finances the creation and development of young companies and invests primarily in the first or second venture capital financing rounds. On a case by case basis, the firm also invests in either younger companies (seed capital) or more mature companies. It seeks to invest in the information technology (software, Internet, telecommunications, networks, hardware, and components) and life sciences (biopharmacy, diagnostics, and medical instruments) sectors. For fund of funds investments, the firm targets primary funds, secondary transactions, and co-investments in French funds. It participates in leverage buyout co-investment operations on a case-by-case basis and also makes secondary acquisitions of stakes in funds or asset portfolios. It concentrates its investments in leverage buyout funds. However, the firm diversifies its investments moderately through venture capital funds in order to benefit from research and development into new products in Europe. The firm prefers to invest in companies headquartered in European Union, even if their commercial activities extend to other geographical areas. It typically invests between â‚¬1 million ($1.5 million) and â‚¬50 million ($74.74 million) in each round, taking a minority interest in its portfolio companies. The firm has the capacity to invest up to â‚¬10 million ($7.58 million) per company over several rounds of financing. It acts as the leader or co-leader in its investment operations and generally takes a seat on the board of directors or the supervisory board of its portfolio companies. IDInvest Partners was founded in 1995 and is based in Paris, France. As of May 31, 2010 it operates as a subsidiary of Groupe IDI.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/3772/3772v3-max-150x150.png"],[[140,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/3772/3772v3-max-250x250.png"],[[140,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/3772/3772v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO
