They invest time and money in founders, and their companies, who are seeking to:</p>\n\n<p>(a) Reduce inefficiencies in large industries with demonstrable disruptive information technology; or,\n(b) Create disruptive offerings in de novo industries.</p>\n\n<p>They are particularly interested in online-to-offline offerings, marketplaces, omnichannel commerce, and civic/education tech. They do not invest in organizations unless they solve a proven problem for users and have traction. They rarely lead rounds, but frequently introduce firms that fit their investment criteria to those who do.</p>","image":null,"offices":[{"description":"NYC Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Brooklyn","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"SF Office","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco ","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Kimerling","permalink":"daniel-kimerling","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0002/3250/23250v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,247],"assets/images/resized/0002/3250/23250v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[365,361],"assets/images/resized/0002/3250/23250v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Zac","last_name":"Townsend","permalink":"zac-townsend","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/tendertree-1-3-million/","source_description":"500 Startups-Backed TenderTree Raises $1.3 Million To Expand Its Marketplace Of In-Home Caregivers","raised_amount":1300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"TenderTree","permalink":"tendertree","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/fuze-network-a-payments-company-focused-on-serving-the-unbanked-under-banked-raises-2-5-million/","source_description":"Fuze Network, A Payments Company Focused On The Under-Banked, Raises $2.5 Million Series ","raised_amount":2500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"Fuze Network","permalink":"fuze-network","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0012/3542/123542v2-max-150x150.png"],[[210,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/3542/123542v2-max-250x250.png"],[[210,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/3542/123542v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.sponsorhub.com/press","source_description":"SPONSORHUB ANNOUNCES INVESTORS IN FIRST ONLINE MARKETPLACE FOR EVENT SPONSORSHIP INDUSTRY ","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"SponsorHub","permalink":"sponsorhub","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0016/5704/165704v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0016/5704/165704v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0016/5704/165704v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Fenwick & West","permalink":"fenwick-west","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/6899/16899v1-max-150x150.png"],[[196,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6899/16899v1-max-250x250.png"],[[196,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/6899/16899v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
