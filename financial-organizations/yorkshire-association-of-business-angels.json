Where conventional financing often fails to serve the smaller &#8216;higher risk&#8217; investment opportunities, Business Angels are now widely accepted as a vital source of funding that bridges the gap in the equity market. Since its inception in 1995, the YABA membership has grown steadily to over 170 Angel and Associate members. YABA meets regularly at various venues throughout the Yorkshire and Humberside region to see entrepreneurs present their ideas to a highly receptive audience and also to network with some of the most influential business leaders in the region. Experience show that some ten per cent of ideas receive financial support from Angels and this investment, in turn, often releases further funding from financial institutions. YABA is non-profit making, charging only a modest membership fee to Angels and a small administration charge to entrepreneurs and takes no commission whatsoever from any funds raised. Entrepreneurs not only have the chance to personally present their ideas at the YABA meeting but also have their &#8216;opportunity&#8217; posted on the secure login area for Angel members to view.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0004/6156/46156v1-max-150x150.png"],[[219,107],"assets/images/resized/0004/6156/46156v1-max-250x250.png"],[[219,107],"assets/images/resized/0004/6156/46156v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1
