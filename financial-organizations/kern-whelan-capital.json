They invest in only a few companies each year, and partner with outstanding management teams for the long term. While they typically are active members of the board of directors for their businesses, they do not seek involvement in their daily operations. Through a long term approach to the liquidity horizon, Kern Whelan investments are not beholden to a single exit strategy, but are instead opportunistic about investor capital return whether through M&amp;A, IPO, recap, dividend, or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Investment Approach</p>\n\n<p>They back strong management teams in companies that generate, or have the potential to generate, operating profit margins of 15% or better. They look for a history of internal growth in a capital efficient manner with good prospects for future growth. They remain opportunistic investors, however, and will not rule out any opportunity with strong cash flow potential. They prefer simple capital structures so that their interests are more closely aligned with management. As Kern Whelan principals they demonstrate their commitment to the success of their investors, management and business by typically serving as the largest personal investors in each of their portfolio companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/9130/29130v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/9130/29130v1-max-250x250.png"],[[339,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/9130/29130v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"220 Sansome Street","address2":"6th Floor","zip_code":"94104","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.7924455,"longitude":-122.4009787}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Operating Partners","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Kern","permalink":"jay-kern","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operating Partners","person":{"first_name":"J.","last_name":"P.
