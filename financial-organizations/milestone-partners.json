Milestoneâ€™s transactions typically provide liquidity to shareholders of privately-owned businesses, facilitate transition of ownership to key managers, and allow management to capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining the legacy of the founders. Milestone has focused consistently on the lower middle market and generated superior returns for its limited partners. Milestone is currently investing in new platforms through Milestone Partners III, a $240 million fund.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0008/4346/84346v2-max-150x150.png"],[[223,111],"assets/images/resized/0008/4346/84346v2-max-250x250.png"],[[223,111],"assets/images/resized/0008/4346/84346v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"595
