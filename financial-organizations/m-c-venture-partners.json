That disposition manifests itself in every aspect of what they do from the development of investment ideas to working with management teams in making significant strategy enhancements. Their investment style is characterized by four key elements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The firm specializes in the early identification of the most promising segments in emerging communications and media. They think for themselves and proactively seek out well-positioned entrepreneurial managers and companies.  </p></li>\n<li><p>They are typically the first institutional investor in their portfolio companies and in most cases, lead the round if there are co-investors.  </p></li>\n<li><p>They participate actively in the company&#8217;s growth and success as a member of the Board of Directors.  Value added input includes perspectives on strategy development, recruiting senior team members, capital raising, and M&amp;A.</p></li>\n<li><p>Their investments range in size from $5m to $50m of equity.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[79,79],"assets/images/resized/0003/4153/34153v1-max-150x150.png"],[[79,79],"assets/images/resized/0003/4153/34153v1-max-250x250.png"],[[79,79],"assets/images/resized/0003/4153/34153v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"75 State Street","address2":"Suite 2500 ","zip_code":"02109","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.358448,"longitude":-71.055118}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing General Partner","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"F.
