Therefore they only invest in companies that are only a daytrip away from Brussels. Their typical participation in an A to B round goes from â‚¬ 500k to â‚¬ 2.0 mio. Along the way of consecutive rounds they reserve up to â‚¬ 4mio per company.</p>\n\n<p>They are rather a team with industrial backgrounds and deal making experience, rather than financial experts. That&#8217;s maybe why they really care to understand and help your business.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/7896/77896v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/7896/77896v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[215,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/7896/77896v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Oudenaardsesteenweg 285, b2","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Erpe-Mere","state_code":null,"country_code":"BEL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.bricsnet.com/html/mediacenter_5.htm","source_description":"Bricsnet Announces $13 Million in Funding","raised_amount":13000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"Bricsnet","permalink":"bricsnet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0007/7782/77782v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/7782/77782v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/7782/77782v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
