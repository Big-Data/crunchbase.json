Crosslink, which traces its roots back to 1989,  was among the first and largest investment firms in the U.S. to integrate public and private growth/technology investing in three families of funds: venture capital funds, long/short hedge funds and a unique hybrid crossover fund. This strategy allows Crosslink to partner with its portfolio companies on a long-term basis. With more than 20 years behind it, Crosslink Capital has invested in over 100 private equity portfolio companies, at the early, mid, and late stages including Ancestry.com (NASDAQ: ACOM), Omniture (acquired by Adobe Systems), Equinix(NASDAQ:EQIX), Pandora, SeaMicro, Twin Creeks Technologies, Virage Logic (NASDAQ: VIRL), and Yipes (acquired by Reliance Communications).
