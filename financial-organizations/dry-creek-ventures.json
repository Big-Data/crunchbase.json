Typically, these companies have exhausted friends and family capital, but do not yet have the operational infrastructure, financial performance, or valuation to attract mainstream venture capital funds. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to equity capital, they contribute extensive operational and finance experience, and the willingness to contribute significant time and effort to helping young companies develop and grow. They look for partnerships, not simply investments. </p>\n\n<p>They understand that entrepreneurs are motivated principally by a passion for their products. But they also believe that teams can succeed where individuals cannot. By providing equity capital, a commitment to partnership, decades of business experience, and extensive contacts, DCV is uniquely positioned to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0004/8955/48955v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0004/8955/48955v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[268,75],"assets/images/resized/0004/8955/48955v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"7212 Dry Creek Road","address2":"","zip_code":"95448","city":"Healdsburg","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.6792923,"longitude":-122.9485699}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Rogers","permalink":"peter-rogers","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/8956/48956v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,154],"assets/images/resized/0004/8956/48956v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,154],"assets/images/resized/0004/8956/48956v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"david-smith-4","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/8957/48957v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,154],"assets/images/resized/0004/8957/48957v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,154],"assets/images/resized/0004/8957/48957v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://green.venturebeat.com/2009/02/05/solar-power-partners-takes-on-32m-for-solar-panels-sales/","source_description":"Solar Power Partners takes on $32M for solar panel sales","raised_amount":32000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":5,"company":{"name":"Solar Power Partners","permalink":"solar-power-partners","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0004/7541/47541v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,102],"assets/images/resized/0004/7541/47541v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,102],"assets/images/resized/0004/7541/47541v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2010/01/lucid-design-completes-15m-series.html","source_description":"Lucid Design Completes a $1.5M Series A Funding","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"Lucid Design Group","permalink":"lucid-design-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/2968/72968v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[211,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/2968/72968v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[211,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/2968/72968v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
