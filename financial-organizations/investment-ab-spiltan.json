The company, which is based in Stockholm, provides multi stage financing to businesses based within Sweden. The company will invest between SEK1 million ($125,000) and SEK10 million ($1.25 million), with a preferred investment amount of SEK2 million to SEK4 million ($240,000 to $490,000). Potential portfolio companies may come from any sector of industry, as it is more important that the business is a viable investment opportunity. Also important is that the management team is committed and has a strong track record. Businesses will be able to leverage the extensive network of angels and other relevant professionals who can contribute expertise for the development of the portfolio company. AB Spiltan will invest roughly 60% of its capital in private companies and the remaining 40% in firms that have already been listed. Private portfolios will need to demonstrate that there will be realistic opportunity for Spiltan to exit within three to five years. Most of the investments in public companies are done through affiliates such as Health Cap and Procuritas.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0010/1526/101526v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/1526/101526v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,69],"assets/images/resized/0010/1526/101526v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"KarlavÐ´gen 50 1tr ","address2":"","zip_code":"114-49","city":"Stockholm","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.cisionwire.se/mwm-system-ab/mwm-tillfors-6--6-miljoner-kronor-genom-nyemission-och-konvertibelt-forlagslan","source_description":"MWM added to 6, 6 million by issuing new shares and convertible debentures","raised_amount":822000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"MWM Media Workflow Management","permalink":"mwm-media-workflow-management","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
