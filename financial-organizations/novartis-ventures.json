They balance the therapeutic focus with investments in medical devices, diagnostics or drug delivery systems. In their investments, they look for unmet need and clinical impact, novel proprietary science and understanding of mechanism, management and board experience and capital efficiency in the program.</p>\n\n<p>They prefer to have their initial investment at the early stage to build the company and follow with additional investment in pace with the companyâ€™s progress. They continue their approach of larger focused investments and anticipate total investments up to USD 15 â€“ 20 mil per company over its life, but it can be as little as 100,000 USD to get started. They will increase their activities to lead or co-lead deals further and remain open to participate in larger syndicates.  </p>\n\n<p>Sectors</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New therapeutics &amp; platforms</li>\n<li>Medical devices/implants</li>\n<li>Diagnostics/biomarkers</li>\n<li>Drug delivery/biopolymers</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0004/4137/44137v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,21],"assets/images/resized/0004/4137/44137v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,21],"assets/images/resized/0004/4137/44137v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Novartis Services, Inc.
