Our primary focusbham is on companies based in the Pacific Northwest, with emphasis on those companies located in the Whatcom, Skagit and Island Counties of Washington State. </p>\n\n<p>Our members are independent business owners and senior corporate executives experienced in financing and developing emerging enterprises. Members have a range of business, industry, and investing experience, but share the desire to engage in the high-risk, high-return potential practice of &#8220;angel investing.&#8221; We mentor and coach the entrepreneurs in whom we invest, sometimes serve on their boards, provide contacts and assist with team building, strategic planning and fundraising.</p>\n\n<p>We review and screen company business plans on a regular basis and select three to four companies to make a 15-minute presentation to our members during our scheduled bi-monthly member meetings.  The angels may collaborate on due diligence, but make individual investment decisions; we do not have a fund and do not necessarily invest as a group. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/7506/27506v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/7506/27506v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/7506/27506v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/1064/213841/","source_description":"Bellingham Angel Group Provides Capital to Local Technology Start-up","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Tatango","permalink":"tatango","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?NewsEntityId=120241","source_description":"Healionics Corporation Raises $2.6 Million from Angels ","raised_amount":2600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":11,"company":{"name":"Healionics ","permalink":"healionics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0004/8801/48801v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/8801/48801v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/8801/48801v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/?p=110364","source_description":"LiquidPlanner raises $1M to help projects adapt when things go wrong","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"LiquidPlanner","permalink":"liquidplanner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/1493/11493v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/11/meridian-closes-1m-seed-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Meridian Closes $1M Seed Funding","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Meridian","permalink":"meridian","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/4992/154992v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/4992/154992v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,256],"assets/images/resized/0015/4992/154992v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
