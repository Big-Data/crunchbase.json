However, most entrepreneurial ventures fail to achieve their goals. Among the most common reasons for such business failures are the inability to execute sound business plans and to access capital funding, particularly at critical early stages of a company&#8217;s development.</p>\n\n<p>Affiliated as Pasadena Angels, Inc., a nonprofit entity, the organization offers early-stage companies the opportunity to benefit from the knowledge of more than 100 experienced entrepreneurs, senior corporate executives, and skilled professionals from a variety of industries and venture capital affiliates.</p>\n\n<p>Approximately 80 companies from a broad range of industries are screened each year by Pasadena Angels members and are provided with invaluable counsel, including insights into developing business and financing strategies that are achievable and fundable. Companies also benefit from the group&#8217;s feedback and the opportunity to connect with individuals who may offer more specialized expertise and advice.</p>\n\n<p>The organization&#8217;s members provide up to $1 million in early-stage financing and seed money to emerging technology-based ventures located in Southern California. The group cooperates with other venture capital firms and angel investment groups to support companies that are raising between $1 to $5 million. Pasadena Angels members invest individually and directly, without any legal pooling of financial resources. The corporate entity, Pasadena Angels, Inc. does not invest or act as an investment agent in any manner.</p>\n\n<p>Pasadena Angels investor members have provided significant early-stage capital to emerging companies in Southern CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â€including nearly $8 million to some 24 companies that have participated in and successfully passed the Pasadena Angels screening process.</p>\n\n<p>Pasadena Angels charges no fees and provides its services to companies which it believes have a significant potential for success and the potential to benefit from an association with the organization. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/9553/29553v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/9553/29553v1-max-250x250.png"],[[338,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/9553/29553v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2400 North Lincoln Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"91001","city":"Altadena","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.1866681,"longitude":-118.1597034}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2007_July_16/ai_n19361564?tag=content;col1","source_description":"myShapeâ„¢ Announces Closing of Series B Round of Funding Led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"MyShape","permalink":"myshape","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/6055/26055v2-max-150x150.png"],[[159,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/6055/26055v2-max-250x250.png"],[[159,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/6055/26055v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/10/06/lehman-bros-backs-myshape-amid-death-rattle/","source_description":"Lehman Bros. backs myShape amid death rattle","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":6,"company":{"name":"MyShape","permalink":"myshape","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/6055/26055v2-max-150x150.png"],[[159,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/6055/26055v2-max-250x250.png"],[[159,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/6055/26055v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/30/h2scan-raises-4m-for-hydrogen-monitoring-technology/","source_description":"H2scan raises $4M for hydrogen monitoring technology","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"H2scan","permalink":"h2scan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/6814/46814v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/6814/46814v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/6814/46814v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":650000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"EZ-Apps","permalink":"ez-apps","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/1853/71853v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[132,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/1853/71853v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[132,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/1853/71853v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://optionease.com/Content/News.aspx?prID=18","source_description":"OptionEase, Inc.
