The experienced investment team and network of relationships in local markets count among foremost strengths.</p>\n\n<p>These assets have earned us the respect of leading foreign investors, who regularly entrust us with ever larger funds. Since 1990 they have managed the capital of major European and American financial institutions: pension and investment funds, insurance companies and banks. The objective is to invest the money entrusted in companies that demonstrate high growth potential, and then to work with the entrepreneurs and the managers to increase the value of those companies. The ultimate aim is to return capital to the investors at attractive multiples.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprise Investors is an independent, private firm owned jointly by its partners. The funds invest in companies from Poland and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, across a wide range of industries. They are able to respond to the challenges of fast-growing economies throughout the region, regardless of which country they are operating in. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[139,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/5934/65934v1-max-150x150.png"],[[139,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/5934/65934v1-max-250x250.png"],[[139,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/5934/65934v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Emilii Plater 53, 31st floor","address2":"","zip_code":"00-113","city":"Warsaw","state_code":null,"country_code":"POL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Faris","permalink":"robert-faris","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jacek","last_name":"Siwicki","permalink":"jacek-siwicki","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner and EIC Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Dariusz","last_name":"ProÅ„czuk","permalink":"dariusz-proczuk","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner and EIC Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Manz","permalink":"robert-manz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner and EIC Board Member","person":{"first_name":"MichaÅ‚","last_name":"Rusiecki","permalink":"micha-rusiecki","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.avg.com/us-en/press-releases-news.ndi-314","source_description":"AVG","raised_amount":52000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":6,"company":{"name":"AVG Technologies","permalink":"avg","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0005/2954/52954v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[188,80],"assets/images/resized/0005/2954/52954v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[188,80],"assets/images/resized/0005/2954/52954v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://webmedia.eu/news/webmedia-group-fuels-growth-through-e7-million-investment-from-enterprise-investors/","source_description":"Webmedia Group fuels growth through â‚¬7 million investment from Enterprise Investors","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"WebMedia Group","permalink":"webmedia-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/8096/108096v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[223,67],"assets/images/resized/0010/8096/108096v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[223,67],"assets/images/resized/0010/8096/108096v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[{"description":"EI acquired 100% ownership of IT outsourcing company Web Inn.
