They seek opportunities in businesses with common economic characteristics: recurring revenue, significant operating leverage, healthy operating margins, strong free cash flow, and franchise customer loyalty. Their investment activity is focused on business services, entertainment, communications, information services, media, and related growth sectors.</p>\n\n<p>The companies in which they invest are leaders in their industries, have well-established business models, are run by experienced management teams, and have significant opportunities for future growth either organically, through acquisition, or both. Their investment activity includes private companies, public companies, and divisions of larger companies. They invest, either as a minority or majority investor, providing equity capital in a wide variety of transactions including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Leveraged buyouts</p></li>\n<li><p>Recapitalizations and dividends</p></li>\n<li><p>Acquisition financings</p></li>\n<li><p>Secondary share purchases</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Spectrum Equity Investors typically invest between $25 million - $100 million per investment and are capable of underwriting much larger equity amounts in conjunction with their limited partners. Our business model and industry focus allows them to respond quickly to opportunities, invest comfortably in a wide variety of investment structures, and provide value to their companies and their management teams as an active member of the board of directors.</p>\n\n<p>Their investment professionals operate from offices in Boston, Massachusetts and Menlo Park, California, and they invest across North America and Western Europe.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/0890/30890v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/0890/30890v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/0890/30890v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":" Boston Office","address1":"One International Place","address2":"29th Floor","zip_code":"02110","city":" Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.640069,"longitude":-71.2417482},{"description":" Menlo Park Office","address1":"333 Middlefield Road","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.456603,"longitude":-122.169362}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Senior Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Brion","last_name":"B.
