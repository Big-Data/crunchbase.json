Ventech then accompanies and assists the managers during each successive financing round until the companyâ€™s initial public offering or M&amp;A event. \nIn practice, Ventech invests on average between â‚¬5 million and â‚¬10 million in any one company, typically between â‚¬2 million and â‚¬5 million in the first financing round.</p>\n\n<p>Ventech Capital III invests principally in Continental Europe but will consider making significant investment opportunities in other regions alongside first-rate local investors. The managers of the companies can turn to Ventech for assistance to build up local franchises and become world leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Ventech has been present in Mainland China since 2007 both to invest locally through a dedicated fund, Natixis Ventech China, and to assist European companies in which Ventech has invested to develop their business in Asia. Because of its presence in China and the experience accumulated over time, Ventech is able to support European and American investees in their strategic development and facilitate their access to Asian markets and partners.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9792/29792v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/9792/29792v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/9792/29792v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"5-7
