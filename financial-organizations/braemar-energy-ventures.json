While many companies and investors have sought to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity today&#8217;s energy industry presents, the unique market issues, scientific contributions and complex web of interrelationships require a specialized expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Braemar Energy Ventures was formed in 2002 to create a venture capital firm with that expertise. Focused exclusively on technology and communications opportunities in the energy sector, Braemar Energy Ventures has both the industry and operating knowledge to select promising young companies, bring them into the larger energy world and guide them to reach their full potential.</p>\n\n<p>The firm&#8217;s four principals have a long history of successful investments, as well as experience financing and operating companies in the energy sector. Together, they have been responsible for investing in almost 40 energy technology companies, including early stage companies which have grown to become some of the most successful in the sector.</p>\n\n<p>Braemar Energy Ventures works with management teams who are skilled in their industry but who can benefit from Braemar&#8217;s assistance with strategic direction and financing issues. Having worked with many early stage companies, the Braemar Energy Ventures principals understand the challenges that many young companies face and provide invaluable counsel to their portfolio companies on longer-term issues, allowing management to focus on daily operations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0005/1049/51049v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/1049/51049v1-max-250x250.png"],[[262,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/1049/51049v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"340 Madison Avenue, 18th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"10017 ","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.782552,"longitude":-75.249203}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"S.
