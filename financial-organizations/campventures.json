They engage with great companies in their earliest stages of development. For such companies, they lead seed rounds on the order of $500 to $1.5M.</p>\n\n<p>Once invested, they work intensely with their companies to prepare them for their next rounds of financing, which are nearly universally led by top-tier venture capital firms.</p>\n\n<p>They have seeded deals for Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Sequoia Capital, Sevin Rosen Funds, Matrix Partners, Interwest Partners, Greylock Partners, August Capital, Trinity Ventures, VantagePoint Venture Partners, and many other blue chip firms.
