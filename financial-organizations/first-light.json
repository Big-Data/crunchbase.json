We aspire to have a catalytic effect on the impact investing industry by expanding opportunities for both investors and entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>First Light identifies, funds, and incubates early-stage enterprises with high-growth potential that provide market-based solutions to challenges faced by customers living in poverty. Using a broad bank of knowledge and a network of key partners, we provide the seed-stage capital necessary to prepare these social ventures for later stages of financing.</p>\n\n<p>First Light&#8217;s mission is to equip high-potential social entrepreneurs with the tools necessary to acquire later-stage investments. We leverage our unique experience and network of impact investment partners to bridge the gap between early- and later-stage investments. First Light distinguishes itself by its focus on pilot or proof-of-concept-stage businesses, small deal size, and high volume of investments. First Light launched in 2009 as an independent seed fund affiliated with Gray Ghost Ventures.</p>\n\n<p>Since we began making investments in March 2010, our portfolio has grown to include twenty-two companies operating in seven countries on four continents, in sectors ranging from water access to education to greenhouse emission reduction. The more than 10,000 lives that these growing enterprises have impacted already represent just a fraction of their potential. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0016/6716/166716v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0016/6716/166716v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,207],"assets/images/resized/0016/6716/166716v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Home Office","address1":"2200 Century Parkway","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"30345","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","person":{"first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Pattillo","permalink":"bob-pattillo","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Hand","permalink":"mark-hand-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/4545/184545v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/4545/184545v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/4545/184545v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investment Manager","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Hardman","permalink":"john-hardman","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investment Associate","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Hand","permalink":"mark-hand","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":125000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Milaap.org","permalink":"milaap-social-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0016/3726/163726v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0016/3726/163726v2-max-250x250.png"],[[255,36],"assets/images/resized/0016/3726/163726v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/207584","source_description":" Drop the Chalk: Changing the Way Teachers Teach","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Drop the Chalk","permalink":"drop-the-chalk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0016/4266/164266v2-max-150x150.png"],[[186,119],"assets/images/resized/0016/4266/164266v2-max-250x250.png"],[[186,119],"assets/images/resized/0016/4266/164266v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[{"description":"First Light and Shell Foundation launched the First Light India Accelerator to invest in seed-stage social enterprises in India.
