Founded in 1996, they have helped scores of entrepreneurs build successful, enduring companies that deliver long-term value to investors, founders, employees and customers alike.</p>\n\n<p>A Unique Collaborative Approach\nCenterPoint is unique in a number of critical ways â€” starting with their proven collaborative approach to venture capital investments. They work together with their portfolio companies to help build productive management teams, implement effective business models and develop strategic technologies that can revolutionize their markets.</p>\n\n<p>Early Stage Investment Specialists\nThey invest chiefly in early-stage private companies at the first or second round of venture capital financing. They understand the special requirements at this critical stage of a startup, and they can apply this understanding to help ensure strategic, rapid growth.</p>\n\n<p>Unrivaled Operating Experience\nCenterPointâ€™s founders, investment professionals and advisors actively share their deep experience as veteran innovators and entrepreneurs themselves. Their team of seasoned professionals have launched successful companies, developed breakthrough products and technologies, pioneered new markets, guided startups through initial public offerings and served as executives and board members at several of the most successful technology companies in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>A Focused Firm\nCenterPoint is firmly committed to Texas and the Southwest.  Clearly, this region will continue to grow rapidly as one of the most important geographic regions in the United States for the IT industry. With our extensive regional network of corporate contacts, investors and service providers, they are well-positioned to take full advantage of this rapid growth, now and in the years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Their Record of Success\nCollaboration, early-stage expertise, operating experience, and regional presence all contribute to an uncommonly high level of success at CenterPoint â€” for both their companies and their investors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/3472/3472v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,136],"assets/images/resized/0000/3472/3472v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,136],"assets/images/resized/0000/3472/3472v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Austin
