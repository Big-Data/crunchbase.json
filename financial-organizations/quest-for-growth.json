The largest part of the portfolio is invested in growth companies listed on European stock exchanges (Euronext, London Stock Exchange, Deutsche BÃ¶rse etc) and other regulated markets. The remainder will be invested in unquoted companies working towards an introduction to a stock exchange or trade sale within 36 months. Quest for Growth rarely invests in start-ups or early stage companies. </p>\n\n<p>Within the category of unquoted companies, up to 15 % of the assets can be invested in venture or private equity funds having an investment policy compatible with that of Quest for Growth.</p>\n\n<pre><code>As of December 31, 2008, funds under management amounted to â‚¬ 67 million.\n\nQuest for Growth has been listed
