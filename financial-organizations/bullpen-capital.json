Extending the capital efficient model beyond the seed stage keeps options open for the founders and investors. </p>\n\n<p>The rise of the super-angels is a capital market response to a new technology trend: the rise of the lean venture, typically an Internet service deploying fast-to-market technology which enables rapid market validation before large capital requirements. The super-angels are emerging as a natural response to a decades long over-sizing of venture firms, built more to fund the semiconductor factories of the past than Internet firms of today.</p>\n\n<p>Bullpen works with its super-angel partners to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Extend a seed round to give a start-up more time to prove itself</li>\n<li>Fund a company requiring more early money than the usual seed deal</li>\n<li>Restart a company that is a â€œfallen angelâ€ but still has great promise</li>\n<li>Fund a â€œrising starâ€ needing a small B round it before it goes to VC auction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The lean model does not depend on the lightning strike of finding the rocket-ship that is immediately successful after its seed round.  Almost every rocket-ship has a rocky start, requiring post-seed nurturing before ascending.  This usually entails one or more â€œpivotsâ€, in which a companyâ€™s basic direction must be changed to find its market.  These changes are wrenching, and require additional capital before proof points are met.  Bullpenâ€™s major role is to lead post-seed stage rounds that support these pivots.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0011/6091/116091v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,35],"assets/images/resized/0011/6091/116091v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,35],"assets/images/resized/0011/6091/116091v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2108
