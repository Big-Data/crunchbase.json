Public funding allows SEED Capital to invest in start-ups in the early stages, and private venture capital is invested in the most successful companies in subsequent investment rounds. This business model allows them to invest earlier than most VC companies and to provide substantially more capital than most seed investors.</p>\n\n<p>SEED Capital invests in 12-15 new promising growth companies every year. This is based on a screening of more than 400 business proposals every year and meetings with more than 100 of these opportunities to further investigate or advice on the suggested business ventures. Besides investment SEED Capital assists portfolio companies with value-generating activities such as management support, business development, organizational and strategic development, marketing, and ad hoc operational, financial, and legal assistance.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,53],"assets/images/resized/0003/0133/30133v3-max-150x150.png"],[[125,53],"assets/images/resized/0003/0133/30133v3-max-250x250.png"],[[125,53],"assets/images/resized/0003/0133/30133v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Denmark
