With more start-ups per capita than any other country, Israel’s high-tech sector is responsible for much of the innovation that has and continues to impact the way we live. As a result, venture investors from around the world have turned to Israel to find these domestic entrepreneurs and to capitalize them on their way to significant valuations and lucrative acquisition opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>However, as the traditional venture capital community in Israel has moved further away from early stage investing in recent years, Angel and Super Angel investors have been closing the gap and taking advantage of substantial market-created incentives.</p>\n\n<p>JANVEST’s unique positioning within this gap, risk mitigated investment strategy, bi-national presence, and investor-focused legal and compliance protections offer the more traditional investor a practical way into Israel’s dynamic technology arena.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/4147/164147v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0016/4147/164147v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0016/4147/164147v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[{"name":"JANVEST I","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":10,"raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","source_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/print-edition/2012/03/02/israeli-startups-attract-local.html","source_description":"Individual Accredited Investors"}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
