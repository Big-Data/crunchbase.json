It structures each of its investments under a separate Special Purpose Vehicle and allows investors to opt-in or opt-out on a deal by deal basis.  SLGâ€™s value proposition is that it provides individual investors and small family offices an opportunity to invest their capital alongside sophisticated sector specific institutional investors. </p>\n\n<p>Stony Lonesome Group is a generalist, but tends to favor investments in areas like National Security, Homeland Defense, and Military related companies. We will invest across the capital structure to include equity, debt, and short term credit financings and our typical investment ranges from $100,000 to $1mm and we will syndicate larger deals in the $1mm to $10mm range.  We are active hands on investors with an extensive network of venture partners with sector specific expertise. </p>","image":null,"offices":[{"description":"Main Office ","address1":"226 Mountain Rd","address2":"","zip_code":"06897","city":"Wilton ","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Drake","permalink":"sean-drake","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/8627/168627v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/8627/168627v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/8627/168627v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Angel Round investor in TroopSwap Inc.
