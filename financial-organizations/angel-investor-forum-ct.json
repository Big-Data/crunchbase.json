Due to the widening gap in the capital markets, there is a shortage of funding  available at the seed stage ($250K-$5M). This funding gap represents a great opportunity for investment in companies with substantial growth potential but an inability to attract venture capital.     AIF members invest their time, talent and money in supporting companies with solid business models and their efforts to grow   successfully.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,125],"assets/images/resized/0019/0355/190355v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[218,183],"assets/images/resized/0019/0355/190355v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[218,183],"assets/images/resized/0019/0355/190355v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"200 Main Street","address2":"","zip_code":"06010","city":"Bristol","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/02/14/daily53-Pixability-draws-1M-from-nine-angel-investors.html","source_description":"Pixability draws $1M from nine angel investment groups","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Pixability","permalink":"pixability","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0006/9292/69292v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,31],"assets/images/resized/0006/9292/69292v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,40],"assets/images/resized/0006/9292/69292v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2012/05/14/daily39-JamHub-closes-11M-Series-A-round.html","source_description":"JamHub closes $1.1M Series A round","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"JamHub","permalink":"jamhub","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0019/0350/190350v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,51],"assets/images/resized/0019/0350/190350v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[238,51],"assets/images/resized/0019/0350/190350v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
