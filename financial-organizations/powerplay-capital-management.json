Yet in many ways it typifies the industry:High-income investors have poured billions of dollars into privately managed funds that pursue a host of investment strategies, from the daringly simple to the exceedingly complex.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike mutual funds, Powerplay tends to concentrate its investments in a handful of stocks. And also unlike mutual funds, Powerplay charges its clients a &#8220;performance fee&#8221;:If the fund does well, the managers get a percentage of the profits.Hedge funds are exempt from U.S. rules barring incentive fees because of the net worth, and hence the sophistication, of their clients.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,12],"assets/images/resized/0002/9626/29626v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,20],"assets/images/resized/0002/9626/29626v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/9626/29626v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"12 South Sixth Street","address2":"Suite 215","zip_code":"55402","city":"Minneapolis","state_code":"MN","country_code":"USA","latitude":44.978838,"longitude":-93.27282}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.nwinnovation.com/fullstory/0014915.html","source_description":"Infinia Raises $7M (Total B = $57m)","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Infinia","permalink":"infinia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
