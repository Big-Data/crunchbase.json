Since its inception in 1984, ROTH has been an innovator in this market. In the 1990&#8217;s ROTH participated in underwriting IPOs for small-cap companies. As this market changed, ROTH helped develop the PIPE (private investment in public equity) financing structure. ROTH was one of the first U.S. investment banks to focus on financing small-cap Chinese companies, and established a Representative Office in Shanghai in 2007 and a Hong Kong (Limited) Office in 2010. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0012/5145/125145v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0012/5145/125145v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[335,93],"assets/images/resized/0012/5145/125145v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"24 Corporate Plaza Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"92660","city":"Newport Beach","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
