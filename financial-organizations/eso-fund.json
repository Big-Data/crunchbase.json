Through a unique partnering agreement, the Fund provides employees with the cash required to exercise their options and participates in the upside if the stock gains value through a sale or other event. If the stock becomes valueless, the Fund, not the employee, bears the loss. We provide a clear, straightforward, and employee-friendly approach to exercising stock options without financial stress.</p>\n\n<p>The Fund was formed by Stephen Roberts and Jimmy Lackie. Both founders have 20+ years of experience in venture capital, private equity, and operations at entrepreneurial companies. Leveraging our knowledge, we have developed a flexible due diligence strategy and transaction protocol at ESO to rapidly evaluate and close transactions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0020/5385/205385v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0020/5385/205385v1-max-250x250.png"],[[306,98],"assets/images/resized/0020/5385/205385v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"350 Marine Parkway","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"94065","city":"Redwood Shores","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Roberts","permalink":"stephen-roberts","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jimmy","last_name":"Lackie","permalink":"jimmy-lackie","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Chou","permalink":"scott-chou","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6934/46934v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6934/46934v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6934/46934v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[{"name":"Inaugural Fund","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":9,"raised_amount":25000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","source_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/09/idUS164556+09-Aug-2012+PRN20120809","source_description":"ESO Venture Fund Closes its Inaugural Fund"}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
