We are focused on working with entrepreneurs starting information technology companies: in traditional VC parlance, early stage technology investments. Within that sector, we would prefer to follow the instincts and experience of the entrepreneurs and invest in all kinds of technology-based ventures. We believe, however, that it is not the job of venture investors to fund companies that require large amounts of capital, more than $20M, to create a stable, validated business operation. So weâ€™re much more interested in enterprises that donâ€™t require much capital to prove their point and entrepreneurs who are more interested in creating more value than raising more venture capital.&#8221; Source: <a href=\"http://alsop-louie.com/about/\" title=\"Alsop Louie Partners&#8217; website\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alsop Louie Partners&#8217;
