Their strategy is to use the experience of their partners and associates to apply intense focus and expertise to complex transactions which often involve an international component. Their counterparts are typically ownership, the board of directors and C-level executives. Their integrity, tenacity and commitment to their clients are reflected in the successful resolutions they have achieved. </p>\n\n<p>In Mesco&#8217;s capital formation activities, they have provided value well beyond their capital input, particularly as they have become deeply involved with thinly staffed early stage companies. Their direct investments are typically in conjunction with previous partners, which have included U.S. and foreign banks, wealthy U.S. and foreign families, Venture Capital Firms and Endowment Funds. Their extensive relationships with capital sources globally, together with their expertise in the capital markets have helped construct optimal capital structures for clients. </p>\n\n<p>Mesco was founded in 1990 by Joel Mesznik, who had spent the previous 20 years as an investment banker on Wall Street. His vision was to provide select clients with high value specialized advice and capital at critical strategic junctures.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/9382/29382v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,37],"assets/images/resized/0002/9382/29382v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/9382/29382v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and President","person":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"R Mesznik","permalink":"joel-r-mesznik","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Eytan","last_name":"Mesznik","permalink":"eytan-mesznik","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Manager & Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"Aspras","permalink":"irene-aspras","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2007/12/24/story3-Startup-uTest-to-pay-testers-by-the-bug.html","source_description":"Startup uTest to Pay Testers by the Bug","raised_amount":2300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"uTest","permalink":"utest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/2761/2761v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/2761/2761v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[361,136],"assets/images/resized/0000/2761/2761v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/01/utest-raises-5-million-more-for-crowdsourced-bug-testing/","source_description":"uTest Raises $5 Million More For Crowdsourced Bug Testing","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"uTest","permalink":"utest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/2761/2761v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/2761/2761v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[361,136],"assets/images/resized/0000/2761/2761v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
