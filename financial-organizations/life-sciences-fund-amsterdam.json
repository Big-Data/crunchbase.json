Its goal is to provide investment capital to fund biomedical entrepreneurial activity in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. The fund targets companies that are developing commercially promising products and technologies in life sciences, including: pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, information technology and other high technology opportunities that offer venture capital returns.</p>\n\n<p>The fund focuses on seed and early stage companies, but also on pre-seed commercially viable academic projects. The benefits of this early funding means that emerging medical breakthroughs in research and technology businesses can be sustained by sufficient venture capital to optimize their chances of success and ultimately provide revenue to the fundâ€™s investors and the research groups involved. Once these companies are established with seed funding, the Life Sciences Fund Amsterdam will seek to work with other traditional venture capital companies to partner in the effort to advance these technologies.</p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Capital Report Index","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"AIMM Therapeutics","permalink":"aimm-therapeutics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,92],"assets/images/resized/0006/3744/63744v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[136,92],"assets/images/resized/0006/3744/63744v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[136,92],"assets/images/resized/0006/3744/63744v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.sigmascreening.com/press1.pdf","source_description":"SIGMASCREENING CLOSES FINANCING ROUND","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":6,"company":{"name":"Sigmascreening","permalink":"sigmascreening","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0010/6551/106551v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,172],"assets/images/resized/0010/6551/106551v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,232],"assets/images/resized/0010/6551/106551v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.acsbiomarker.com/press6_eng.htm","source_description":"ACS BIOMARKER B.V.
