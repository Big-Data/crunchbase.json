The group seeks to provide financial capital, mentorship, and advisory support to high growth organizations. The company will consider opportunities nationally, but is focused on the greater Midwest given its Northbrook, IL base. </p>\n\n<p>The group invests across sectors with particular interest within Software, Media &amp; Entertainment, Mobile, Manufacturing &amp; Industrial, Consumer/Retail &amp; Food/Beverage, Business Services, Healthcare Services and CleanTech. We do not currently invest in Life Sciences, Biotech, or Real Estate. </p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to provide our financial and mentor capital to help build a dynamic entrepreneurial and investor community in the Midwest, though we do consider opportunities across the country. To work towards this goal, we target opportunities which can grow quickly into large sustainable businesses, and which will fuel innovation and job creation within our region. </p>\n\n<p>We target companies raising $500K to $3MM, with pre-money valuation up to $5MM. Our sweet spot for initial investment is in the range of $100K to $500K. With these considerations, we are either involved as a single party in a small round or as part of a larger round. Based on the specific financing needs, our investments have ranged from as little as $10k up to ~$1MM, and through our network and alliances with multiple investment parties, we can be helpful in bringing together syndicates of several million dollars. </p>\n\n<p>Cornerstone Angels is a member of the Angel Capital Association and is active in collaboration and syndication with Angel groups nationwide. We actively support companies and entrepreneurs under funding consideration by making introductions to other parties as relevant and based on interest. </p>\n\n<p>Through our efforts since our launch we have built a portfolio of 17 companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/9091/79091v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/9091/79091v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[302,85],"assets/images/resized/0007/9091/79091v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"2100 Sanders Road","address2":"Suite 170","zip_code":"60062","city":"Northbrook","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Gruber","permalink":"michael-gruber-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Laurence","last_name":"Hayward","permalink":"laurence-hayward","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/FCHOarKGWbE&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/FCHOarKGWbE&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Early stage/start-up funding- Cornerstone Angels Founders interview on Comcast </p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/cyIKcRLIq4k&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/cyIKcRLIq4k&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Michael Gruber on his new investor network Cornerstone Angels Feb19, 2007 </p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://angelsoft.net/angel-group/cornerstone-angels","title":"Angelsoft profile for Cornerstone Angels"},{"external_url":"http://www.businesspov.com/article/146","title":"Article and video on Cornerstone Angels"}]}
