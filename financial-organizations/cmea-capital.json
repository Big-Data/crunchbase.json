We believe that the most successful venture backed companies are those that are science based, with experienced teams that have a vision. As a result, CMEA typically invests in companies that have cutting edge and highly differentiated technology at their core and founding teams of the highest caliber still in place. These are companies that have the potential to transform their industries.</p>\n\n<p>CMEA Capital was founded in 1989 and maintains offices in San Francisco and Menlo Park. We invest in both early and late stage science-focused ventures, and leverage a strong network of corporate, investment, and entrepreneurial relationships on behalf of portfolio companies. Our partners and associates have extensive science, engineering, and operational backgrounds, providing us the confidence to look beyond today&#8217;s technology. We apply our focus on science and teams to our collaborations with entrepreneurs and venture investment partners who are changing the world, one great company at a
