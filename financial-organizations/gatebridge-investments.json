GateBridge seeks investments where it can earn long-term, high rates of return on its capital, by taking equity stakes in companies in partnership with a management team. While the primary focus is on technology related companies, they will consider and have experience with non-technology companies as well.\nBecause it is not an institutional fund, GateBridge can be much more flexible than a traditional private equity firm and can consider a broad range of investments sizes: from very small early stage investments to arraigning complex large transactions requiring $100 million of capital or more. Also, because GateBridge does not operate a fund with a finite life, it can take a much longer term perspective on its investments than a traditional private equity fund which may need to exit an investment quickly to be able to raise it&#8217;s next fund.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0006/6629/66629v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0006/6629/66629v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,81],"assets/images/resized/0006/6629/66629v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"3983 Travis St.","address2":"","zip_code":"75204","city":"Dallas","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Rodakis","permalink":"john-rodakis","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20091111005337&newsLang=en","source_description":"Business Wire","raised_amount":3500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":11,"company":{"name":"Ortho Kinematics","permalink":"ortho-kinematics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0006/5846/65846v1-max-150x150.png"],[[225,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/5846/65846v1-max-250x250.png"],[[225,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/5846/65846v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/ortho-kinematics-inc-series-a-20m/","source_description":"Ortho Kinematics, Inc.: Series A $2.0M","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":31,"company":{"name":"Ortho Kinematics","permalink":"ortho-kinematics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0006/5846/65846v1-max-150x150.png"],[[225,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/5846/65846v1-max-250x250.png"],[[225,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/5846/65846v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
