Structured financing is based on the discounted value of the assets and assured compliance in the valuation and subsequent project. The valuation process is rigorous but straightforward and depending on the availability of documentation, financing can be available completed within 60-90 days.  We consider properties under management throughout the world.</p>\n\n<p>Structured finance secures funds through a series of legal obligations and applies rigid measures for mitigating risk associated with these complex financial transactions.  We specialize in monetizing bonds based on in-situ assets precious metals, oil and gas, and real estate.  KM Financing further mitigates risk through the development and on going management of enterprise risk management techniques linked to an overall compliance regime.  Specifically we manage a quarterly COSO ERM compliance schedule combined with a yearly independent 3rd party audit.</p>\n\n<p>The end result for clients is that they can operate their companies in a private capacity with predictable monthly financing that can be applied to ongoing operations.  The bond&#8217;s monthly coupon interest and principal are self serviced. This allows our customers to build up their bond&#8217;s resale value and rating over the course of the financing, which in some cases lasts for up to 10 years.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0006/6245/66245v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/6245/66245v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/6245/66245v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"955 Suncastle Drive SE","address2":"watever","zip_code":"T2X 2L7","city":"Calgary","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Perry","last_name":"Kinkaide","permalink":"perry-kinkaide","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jordan","last_name":"McBean","permalink":"jordan-mcbean","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Anton","last_name":"Wootliff","permalink":"anton-wootliff","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
