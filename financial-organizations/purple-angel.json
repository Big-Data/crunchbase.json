Adopting the purple of BNR&#8217;s logo led to a quick decision on the naming of the group.\nPurple Angel is an informal group bound together by the relationships and experience of our members. Prospective investments are reviewed collectively by the group, led by a smaller subgroup working in detail with the\ncompany. Investment decisions are individual, as is the custom with many organized angel groups.\nTo date the firm has invested in 23 companies, all but two in the National Capital Region.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/3108/103108v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/3108/103108v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,136],"assets/images/resized/0010/3108/103108v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"17 Rocky Point Rd ","address2":"","zip_code":"K2H 8H2 ","city":"Nepean","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Datamonitor_Mergers_and_Acquisitions-ZIM_Purple_Angel_and_Ontario_Centres_of_Excellence_invest_in_Seregon_Solutions-2052-13673","source_description":"Purple Angel and Ontario Centres of Excellence invest in Seregon Solutions","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Seregon Solutions","permalink":"seregon-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0007/6022/76022v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[211,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/6022/76022v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[211,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/6022/76022v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=111074","source_description":"Natural Convergence Raises $10M","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"Natural Convergence","permalink":"natural-convergence","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/8870/58870v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,88],"assets/images/resized/0005/8870/58870v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,88],"assets/images/resized/0005/8870/58870v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
