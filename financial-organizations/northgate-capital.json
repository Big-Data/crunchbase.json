Not satisfied with being limited to publicly traded stocks, bonds, and real estate opportunities, these investors have allocated a significant portion of their portfolios to investment managers who specialize in alternative asset classes like venture capital, private leveraged buyouts and growth capital, hedge fund strategies, and private real estate investments.</p>\n\n<p>As the number of alternative investment fund managers has proliferated into the thousands around the globe, institutional and family investors are increasingly faced with two challenges when seeking high-quality alternative investment opportunities: identification and access.</p>\n\n<p>Northgate Capital was formed in the late 1990&#8217;s with one goal: to provide institutional and family investors with superior identification of and unsurpassed global access to a very select group of alternative investment opportunities. Today, with a strong and growing group of top institutional and family investors, and a global footprint with offices in the United States and the United Kingdom, Northgate is delivering on this aspiration.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/9482/29482v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0002/9482/29482v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[357,106],"assets/images/resized/0002/9482/29482v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"USA Office","address1":"649 San Ramon Valley Boulevard","address2":"","zip_code":"94526","city":"Danville","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.8129179,"longitude":-121.9957447},{"description":"UK Office","address1":"50 Pall Mall","address2":"","zip_code":"SW1Y 5JH","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5057057,"longitude":-0.136619},{"description":"India Office","address1":"D3,P3B, District Centre, Saket, ","address2":"","zip_code":"110017","city":"New Delhi ","state_code":null,"country_code":"IND","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Hong-Kong Office","address1":"Suite 2601, 26th Floor ","address2":"Two Exchange Square","zip_code":"","city":"Hong Kong","state_code":null,"country_code":"HKG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO & COO","person":{"first_name":"Moez","last_name":"R.
