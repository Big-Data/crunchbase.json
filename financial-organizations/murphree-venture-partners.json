While MVP will do start-up ventures with proven entrepreneurs on occasion, they prefer companies with revenue traction in the $3 million to $30 million range. They also prefer companies whose revenues can be grown both organically and through add-on acquisitions. The firm seeks to align itself with entrepreneurs and management groups with whom they can develop strong working relationships, and with whom they can act in concert as owners/investors. They invest in the Sun Belt region of the U.S. from their four offices in Houston, Austin, Baton Rouge and Birmingham.</p>\n\n<p>The practical experience of Murphree Venture Partners principals brings to the firm a &#8220;real world&#8221; point of view and is especially effective in guiding a venture through the entrepreneurial process to commercial success.
