The goal of all of our Funds is to support Ohio-based technology investment opportunities by facilitating risk sharing on early opportunities with high upside potential. The Funds actively seeks to co-invest with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OTA Members and their networks</li>\n<li>State of Ohio supported validation funds</li>\n<li>Midwest angel funds</li>\n<li>Venture capital funds active in Ohio</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fund I has been fully invested and is no longer seeking new opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Fund II is seeking Ohio-based opportunities in life sciences, information technology, and physical sciences but will also consider investing in consumer retail, distribution and innovative service businesses.
