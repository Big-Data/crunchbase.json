-- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ascent Venture Partners, a long established player in early-stage venture investing, today announced that four of its portfolio companies have completed successful exits in the past 180 days. â€œWe are proud to have worked closely with these four outstanding companies,â€ said Geoff Oblak, General Partner at Ascent. â€œWe congratulate their management teams for building the leading provider in each of their respective markets.â€\r\n\r\nThe most recent transaction was last weekâ€™s purchase of Nova Analytics Corporation by ITT Corporation (NYSE: ITT) for $390 million. Previously, Guardium was acquired by IBM (NYSE: IBM) in November 2009, eCopy was acquired by Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN) in October 2009, and Interactive Supercomputing, Inc. was acquired by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) in September 2009. Across these four transactions, Ascentâ€™s investments have generated returns in excess of five times the original dollars invested.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe seek to invest in, work with and help build early stage-companies with â€˜must haveâ€™ enterprise technologies and solutions. These companies grow and prosper in all economic environments,â€ said Matt Fates, Partner at Ascent Venture Partners, which was founded in 1985. â€œThis consistent focus is essential to Ascentâ€™s investment strategy enabling us to deliver strong results in good markets and bad.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œAscent stands out as a hands-on, deeply committed venture capital partner,â€ said Ram Metser, CEO of Guardium, an IBM company. â€œWe always had access to their team, guidance and resources. And because Ascent operates with a focus on emerging enterprise technology markets, they truly understand the process of building market leading companies.â€\r\n\r\nAscent is actively investing out of its newest fund, Ascent Venture Partners V, L.P., with a continued focus on early-stage, high-growth companies addressing rapidly emerging enterprise technology markets. Building upon the firmâ€™s strong heritage in sectors including advanced computing, data analytics and IT security, Ascent backs exceptional entrepreneurs who are taking advantage of todayâ€™s most important technology trends.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe explosion of enterprise data is an enormous business challenge, which has created a tremendous opportunity for companies that can deliver new ways to store, protect and analyze critical data,â€ said Geoff Oblak. â€œAdditionally, information security continues to be an essential priority for businesses of all sizes. Enterprises remain in the early phases of developing a comprehensive defense to the global cyberthreat.â€\r\n\r\nAbout Ascent Venture Partners\r\n\r\nAscent Venture Partners (www.ascentvp.com) has been investing in early stage, emerging technology companies since 1985.
