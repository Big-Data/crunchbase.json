We have over 50 years of experience creating and investing in medical devices and healthcare companies.  Our focus is on early stage companies and our expertise encompasses all areas of medicine, including   cardiovascular and general surgery, orthopedic surgery, cardiology, radiology, oncology, obesity, gynecology, oncology, and sleep disorders.</p>\n\n<p>Often, an engineer and a physician come to us with an idea or a prototype, and we work with them to help bring about a clinical solution.  We are able to find managers, engineers, and clinicians to fill any gaps in these teams.  This assistance is in addition to the possible investment in the company by Emergent Medical Ventures.  Most of the exits of the companies associated with our managing directors have been by acquisition.</p>\n\n<p>Emergent Medical Partnerâ€™s network is unparalleled in Silicon Valley, as we have access to the CEOâ€™s of large and small companies throughout the United States, relationships with local hospitals to facilitate implementation of clinical trials, and relationships with the major universities in the Bay Area.  Combined, these abilities help entrepreneurs while helping our investors realize superior returns.
