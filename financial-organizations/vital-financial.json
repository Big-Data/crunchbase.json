Certicom possessed a unique market postion in elliptic curve encryption technology and had a highly valuable international portfolio of related patents. Vital Financial became one of the largest shareholders of Certicom and interacted with both Certicom management and other large shareholders. Vital Financial completed a successful exit of its Certicom investment in early 2009 through its sale to Research in Motion Limited.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2009 the firm adopted the name â€œVital Financialâ€ and formally began to seek additional venture capital investments. We now consist of five principal investors, with offices in: Avon, CT; Bethesda, MD; Newark, DE; Philadelphia, PA; Naples, FL; and Lincolnshire, IL. The Principalsâ€™ own funds constitute the majority of each Vital Financial investment. The firm also has a number of individual and institutional co-investors that join Vital Financial in its investments.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0006/3740/63740v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,111],"assets/images/resized/0006/3740/63740v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[272,121],"assets/images/resized/0006/3740/63740v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"5406 Blackistone Road","address2":"","zip_code":"20816","city":"Bethesda","state_code":"MD","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/227938/clinverse-completes-22-million-series-private-equity-financing","source_description":"Clinverse Completes $2.2 Million Series A Private Equity Financing","raised_amount":2200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Clinverse","permalink":"clinverse","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0006/3155/63155v1-max-150x150.png"],[[244,75],"assets/images/resized/0006/3155/63155v1-max-250x250.png"],[[244,75],"assets/images/resized/0006/3155/63155v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/10/shoefitr-receives-1-2m-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Shoefitr Receives $1.2M in Funding","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"Shoefitr","permalink":"shoefitr","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0009/3059/93059v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,202],"assets/images/resized/0009/3059/93059v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,202],"assets/images/resized/0009/3059/93059v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.lgscout.com/news/lookingglass_cyber_solutions_raises_5m_deliver_enterprise_class_cyber_situational_awareness","source_description":"Lookingglass Cyber Solutions Raises $5M to Deliver Enterprise-Class Cyber Situational Awareness","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"Lookingglass Cyber Solutions","permalink":"lookingglass-cyber-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0017/2275/172275v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0017/2275/172275v1-max-250x250.png"],[[269,64],"assets/images/resized/0017/2275/172275v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/02/halfpenny-technologies-raises-2-25m.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Halfpenny Technologies Raises $2.25M","raised_amount":2250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Halfpenny Technologies","permalink":"halfpenny-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0008/9991/89991v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0008/9991/89991v2-max-250x250.png"],[[374,86],"assets/images/resized/0008/9991/89991v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/06/novatract-surgical-raises-2-37m-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"NovaTract Surgical Raises $2.37M in Series A Funding","raised_amount":2370000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"NovaTract Surgical","permalink":"novatract-surgical","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0010/9759/109759v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0010/9759/109759v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,200],"assets/images/resized/0010/9759/109759v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
