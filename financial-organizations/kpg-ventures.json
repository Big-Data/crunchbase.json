We must take the best of what the early venture capitalists did and combine that with the rapidly changing world of today.</p>\n\n<p>KPG is not your fatherâ€™s VC firm to borrow a clichÃ© from the car company and hereâ€™s why.</p>\n\n<p>KPG is small and focused solely on the consumer Internet space making it easy for you to determine a fit.</p>\n\n<p>We have the operational expertise you need to grow your business from an idea on a paper napkin to a company of sustained value.</p>\n\n<p>We make decisions fast so you donâ€™t have to wait for Monday partner meetings to get a response, and we move quickly to respond to the competitive landscape.</p>\n\n<p>We have an excellent network of relationships to help your company with its needs in everything from recruiting to growing revenue.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/9299/19299v1-max-150x150.png"],[[119,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/9299/19299v1-max-250x250.png"],[[119,80],"assets/images/resized/0001/9299/19299v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"Pier
