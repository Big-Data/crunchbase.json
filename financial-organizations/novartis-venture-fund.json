We balance the therapeutic focus with investments in medical devices, diagnostics or drug delivery systems. In our investments we look for unmet need and clinical impact, novel proprietary science and understanding of mechanism, management and board experience and capital efficiency in the program.</p>\n\n<p>We prefer to have our initial investment at the early stage to build the company and  follow with additional investment in pace with the companyâ€™s progress. We continue our approach of larger focused investments and anticipate total investments up to USD 15 â€“ 20 mio per company over its life, but it can be as little as 100&#8217;000 USD to get started. We will increase our activities to lead  or co-lead deals further and remain open to participate in larger syndicates.  </p>\n\n<p>Sectors</p>\n\n<p>New therapeutics &amp; platforms\nMedical devices/implants\nDiagnostics/biomarkers\nDrug delivery/biopolymers\nGeography</p>\n\n<p>USA/Canada\nEurope\nSwitzerland\nAsia/Pacific </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0005/9083/59083v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[212,19],"assets/images/resized/0005/9083/59083v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[212,19],"assets/images/resized/0005/9083/59083v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Forum 1-3.73","address2":"P.O.
