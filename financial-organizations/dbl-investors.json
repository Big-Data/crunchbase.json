The DBL Investors team completed its spinout from JPMorgan in January of 2008 and has managed the Fund since inception. The Fund invests in companies that can deliver market-rate venture capital returns while enabling social, environmental and economic improvement in the San Francisco Bay Area&#8217;s low and moderate income neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>Investments are made in private, primarily mid-to-late stage growth companies across all industries, with a focus on the strengths of the Bay Area including: Clean Technology, Health Care, Specialty Consumer Products and Services, and Information Technology. The Fund can lead or co-invest with other funds and has made 18 investments to date. The Fund&#8217;s limited partner investors include major banks and insurance companies, foundations, corporations and private individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The Fund assists its portfolio companies in developing a &#8220;double bottom line&#8221; to achieve strong long-term financial success as well as positive social and environmental improvement in their local communities. We believe that the social and environmental practices that young companies choose to adopt can be significantly beneficial to the fiscal bottom line both via direct benefits of cost savings and value creation, and via indirect benefits of creating goodwill with their market, customers and community, and enhancing employee morale and retention. The Fund helps portfolio companies implement double bottom line programs at a pace and scope that fits each company&#8217;s financial objectives and stage of growth. In this way, companies can create a balanced culture of financial success and connection to the community from their early stages.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/8890/28890v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/8890/28890v1-max-250x250.png"],[[293,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/8890/28890v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"One
