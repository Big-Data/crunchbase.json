(&#8220;BC Discovery Fund,&#8221; &#8220;BCDF&#8221; or the &#8220;Fund&#8221;) is a diversified venture capital investment fund which allows investors to participate in the emerging technology industry in British Columbia. The Fund issues its shares under the Venture Capital Corporation (VCC) program, a BC government initiative to promote economic diversification and investment in small businesses, including technology ventures. In addition to enabling participation in innovative, local companies, BC Discovery Fund provides retail investors access to private venture capital investment opportunities, which are often only accessible to institutional shareholders and &#8220;angel&#8221; investors.</p>\n\n<p>Eligible individual investors in the Fund receive a tax credit equal to 30% of the amount invested, to a maximum of a $60,000 tax credit per annum. The tax credit on investments into the Fund during the first 60 days of the year can be carried back and applied against the prior year&#8217;s taxes payable. To the extent that the amount of the tax credit exceeds an individual&#8217;s British Columbia taxes otherwise payable, the individual is entitled to a refund of the difference. Shares in the Fund are eligible for RRSPs, RRIFs and RESPs. The tax credit is also available to B.C. corporations to reduce B.C. taxes payable.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/1534/31534v1-max-150x150.png"],[[154,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/1534/31534v1-max-250x250.png"],[[154,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/1534/31534v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"570-1285 West Pender Street","zip_code":"V6E 4B1","city":"Vancouver, BC","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Neil","last_name":"de Gelder","permalink":"neil-de-gelder","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Alan Winter","permalink":"dr-alan-winter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"McEwen","permalink":"john-mcewen-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"John MacDonald","permalink":"dr-john-macdonald","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Jaako","permalink":"harry-jaako-2","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/24/movie-set-inc-piles-15-million-more-for-total-5-million-in-series-a-funding/","source_description":"Movie Set Inc. piles on $1.5 million more for total $5 million in Series A funding","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"MovieSet","permalink":"movieset","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/8518/38518v1-max-150x150.png"],[[186,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/8518/38518v1-max-250x250.png"],[[186,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/8518/38518v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-movieset-gets-2-million-for-behind-the-scenes-movie-footage/","source_description":"Updated: MovieSet Gets $5 Million For Behind The Scenes Movie Footage","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"MovieSet","permalink":"movieset","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/8518/38518v1-max-150x150.png"],[[186,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/8518/38518v1-max-250x250.png"],[[186,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/8518/38518v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/BC-Discovery-Fund-Audiovox-ccn-13845972.html?x=1&.v=1","source_description":"BC Discovery Fund, Audiovox Canada and TELUS Ventures Make $1.85 Million Follow-On Investment in Rx Networks Inc.","raised_amount":1850000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Rx Networks","permalink":"rx-networks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[82,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/7142/57142v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[82,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/7142/57142v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[82,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/7142/57142v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.tantalus.com/2005-12-08_Venture.php","source_description":"TANTALUS COMPLETES $9.4 MILLION PRIVATE EQUITY FINANCING Investment to Exploit Early Market Success ","raised_amount":8120000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Tantalus Systems","permalink":"tantalus-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/4184/74184v1-max-150x150.png"],[[191,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/4184/74184v1-max-250x250.png"],[[191,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/4184/74184v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/10/d-wave-systems-closes-30m-equity-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"D-Wave Systems Closes $30M Equity Funding","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":4,"company":{"name":"D-Wave Systems","permalink":"d-wave-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0006/9689/69689v1-max-150x150.png"],[[185,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/9689/69689v1-max-250x250.png"],[[185,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/9689/69689v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
