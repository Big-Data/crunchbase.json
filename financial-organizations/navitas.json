They focus primarily on long-term corporate returns. Our yardsticks are solid entrepreneurial skills and strong market positions.</p>\n\n<p>NAVITAS has a flat management structure, enabling us to take decisions quickly, even when substantial sums are involved. As we do not have a &#8216;closed end&#8217; structure, we do not have to dispose of companies within a few years of buying them. And we are also willing to take part in follow-up investments, providing that there are good growth prospects.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/9296/49296v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/9296/49296v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/9296/49296v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Landgoed Ewijckshoeve, Soestdijkerweg 12","address2":"","zip_code":"3734 MH","city":"Bilthoven / Lage Vuursche","state_code":null,"country_code":"NLD","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Cees","last_name":"L.A.
