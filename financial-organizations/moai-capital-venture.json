We look to take an active role in most of the companies we invest in, because we believe our insight and expertise are far more valuable than our capital.</p>\n\n<p>Sector of investiment:</p>\n\n<p>Real Time Media,\nSocial E-commerce,\nVertical E-marketplace,\nGaming, Gambling and Skill Game,\nSoftware as a service,\nCloud Computing,\nMobile e Geo Advertising.</p>\n\n<p>Moai capital fills the startup funding gap by providing just enough capital to get your idea off the ground. Your new company could receive  money from 50,000 to 250.000 euro in seed funding.</p>\n\n<p>Almost nothing is too early. Weâ€™ve accepted companies with no more than an idea, a dream, and maybe a dog.
