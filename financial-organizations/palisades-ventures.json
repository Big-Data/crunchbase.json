They prefer to price deals and take a lead position with board participation. In certain situations, they will join syndicated financings with other leading venture capital firms. Their typical investment is between $2.5 and $7 million, with reserves for subsequent financings.</p>\n\n<p>They focus on companies where they can leverage their industry, financial, and technical knowledge of the IT, communications, and media sectors for the benefit of portfolio companies. Members of the fundâ€™s Management Team and Advisory Board have well-established professional relationships with global strategic players in the sectors, and they are affiliated with large financial institutions. Through these relationships, members of the fund provide active support for portfolio companies by introducing them to potential customers or partners as they position themselves in their markets. This ability to provide a link between portfolio companies and strategic players is one of Palisades Ventures&#8217; unique strengths.</p>\n\n<p>Credit Suisse First Boston (â€œCSFBâ€) and Centre Partners are the lead institutional investors in Palisades Ventures and both are members of the General Partner. Centre Partners provides all of the PVâ€™s infrastructure and back office services, participates in the due diligence process, and sits on the fundâ€™s Investment Committee. Palisades Ventures is managed by Paul Dâ€™Addario and Bruce Pollack, Managing Director of Centre Partners.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/9508/29508v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0002/9508/29508v1-max-250x250.png"],[[330,122],"assets/images/resized/0002/9508/29508v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"11726 San Vicente Blvd.","address2":"Suite 450","zip_code":"90049","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":34.05304,"longitude":-118.46643}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Dâ€™Addario","permalink":"paul-daddario","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Anders","last_name":"Richardson","permalink":"anders-richardson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","person":{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Ivankovich","permalink":"henry-lichstein","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/fresh-money/article_30125.html?Apacheta","source_description":"","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"V-Enable","permalink":"v-enable","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7185/17185v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7185/17185v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7185/17185v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/08/01/mobile-directory-startup-v-enable-raising-22m/","source_description":"Mobile directory startup V-Enable raising $2.2M","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"V-Enable","permalink":"v-enable","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7185/17185v1-max-150x150.png"],[[120,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7185/17185v1-max-250x250.png"],[[120,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7185/17185v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-159548025.html","source_description":"Intelligent Thermal Management Chip Provider Andigilog Completes Series B Financing.","raised_amount":18000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"Andigilog","permalink":"andigilog","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.soa.com/news/press_detail/soa_software_closes_11_million_venture_round/","source_description":"SOA Software Closes $11 Million Venture Round","raised_amount":11000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"SOA Software ","permalink":"soa-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0008/3559/83559v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,60],"assets/images/resized/0008/3559/83559v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,60],"assets/images/resized/0008/3559/83559v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/local-mobile-ad-network-xad-raises-9m-from-softbank-and-others/","source_description":"Local Mobile Ad Network xAd Raises $9M From SoftBank And Others","raised_amount":9000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"xAd","permalink":"xad","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/6211/106211v5-max-150x150.png"],[[182,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/6211/106211v5-max-250x250.png"],[[328,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/6211/106211v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
