Our focus is on European startups in the internet and mobile field. At Vidoze we invest our own money, which makes us different from Venture Capitalists. Another important aspect is the level of involvement. Between the three of us we have more than 40 years of experience working in tech companies. Ranging from technical to sales to finance roles. We aim to help the founders of a startup to get from a first version to a version that proofs the business model. Our involvement is in the form of a mentoring shareholder.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0020/9570/209570v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0020/9570/209570v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[385,109],"assets/images/resized/0020/9570/209570v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/pastbook-raises-250k-to-help-preserve-online-memories-instagrammers-first-in-line/","source_description":"PastBook Raises $250K To Help Preserve Online Memories, Instagrammers First In Line","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":4,"company":{"name":"PastBook","permalink":"pastbook","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0016/8325/168325v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0016/8325/168325v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,90],"assets/images/resized/0016/8325/168325v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
