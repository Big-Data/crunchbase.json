The purpose of reorganized Comdisco is to sell, collect or otherwise reduce to money in an orderly manner the remaining assets of the corporation. Pursuant to Comdisco&#8217;s plan of reorganization and restrictions contained in its certificate of incorporation, Comdisco is specifically prohibited from engaging in any business activities inconsistent with its limited business purpose. Accordingly, within the next few years, it is anticipated that Comdisco will have reduced all of its assets to cash and made distributions of all available cash to holders of its common stock and contingent distribution rights in the manner and priorities set forth in the Plan. At that point, the company will cease operations and no further distributions will be made.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/9064/29064v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[216,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/9064/29064v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[216,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/9064/29064v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Rosemont Office","address1":"6111 North River Road","address2":"","zip_code":"60018","city":"Rosemont","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.9898553,"longitude":-87.8598727}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"President and Chief Investment Officer","person":{"first_name":"Manuel A.","last_name":"Henriquez","permalink":"manuel-a-henriquez","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/8378/18378v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,184],"assets/images/resized/0001/8378/18378v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,184],"assets/images/resized/0001/8378/18378v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.herculestech.com/team/employeedetails.asp?EmployeeID=2&amp;sec=invest\" title=\"Hercules Tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hercules Tech</a></p>"}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.opentable.com/info/newspage.aspx?id=77","source_description":"","raised_amount":36000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2000,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"OpenTable","permalink":"opentable","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0000/0022/22v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,34],"assets/images/resized/0000/0022/22v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,34],"assets/images/resized/0000/0022/22v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/09/10/active-network-raises-65m-for-sports-community-site/","source_description":"Active Network raises $65M for sports community site","raised_amount":65000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"ACTIVE Network","permalink":"activenetwork","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/1037/11037v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/1037/11037v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,126],"assets/images/resized/0001/1037/11037v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
