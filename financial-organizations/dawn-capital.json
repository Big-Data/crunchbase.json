We also consider technology enabled services companies, with an emphasis on finance and healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>We consider investing in companies at all stages of their development, beginning with the start-up phase and extending to late stage rounds.</p>\n\n<p>The critical factors for our investment committee are the strength of the company&#8217;s management team and its business model. Additionally, it is important that the profile of the company is one that enables the Dawn team to add value as an active partner.</p>\n\n<p>The Dawn team has invested across the UK and our investments have typically been in the range of Â£100,000 to Â£5M. </p>\n\n<p>Our strategy is to back great teams in technology-driven companies that are seeking to create new markets or revolutionise existing ones. We focus on early-stage and development capital and take a â€œhands onâ€ approach in assisting portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p>Although every company we back is different, they all often travel very similar growth paths. Our role is to bring the collective weight of experience of our team, our advisors, our board and our portfolio to bear on each company so that its path is as short, as untroubled and ultimately as profitable as possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0004/2763/42763v2-max-150x150.png"],[[221,49],"assets/images/resized/0004/2763/42763v2-max-250x250.png"],[[221,49],"assets/images/resized/0004/2763/42763v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"14
