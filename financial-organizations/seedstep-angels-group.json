Due to the widening gap in the capital markets, there is a shortage of funding available at the seed stage ($250K-$5M). This funding gap represents a great opportunity for investment in companies with substantial growth potential but an inability to attract venture capital. Seedstep members invest their time, talent and/or capital in companies with solid business models and in entrepreneurs with successful growth experience.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0020/1804/201804v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[239,99],"assets/images/resized/0020/1804/201804v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[239,99],"assets/images/resized/0020/1804/201804v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/07/material-processing-raises-250k-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Associated Material Processing Raises $250K in Funding","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Associated Material Processing","permalink":"associated-material-processing","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
