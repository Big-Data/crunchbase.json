Based in Al-Khobar, it remains the flagship of the Saad Group. Its history has been one of innovation, with many divisions of Saad owing it their origins. A natural progression in the 1980s was the Group&#8217;s expansion into building development, a prime example of which is the Oasis residential communities in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The Group also entered the field of travel and tourism, initially to facilitate the travel requirements of its expatriate workforce. From this beginning, Saad Travel and Tourism has now established itself as a leading market player. At the heart of the Saad Group reside its founder&#8217;s values and dedication. These embrace the integrity, insight and innovation that combine to drive Saad forward not only as a business, but also as a responsible member of all the communities in which it operates. At Saad, these impacts are always linked and, from the outset, the Group has been an enthusiastic and committed supporter of charities in the region. Its own charitable arm - the Saad Benevolent Fund - was established as a pre-cursor to the company&#8217;s current wider initiatives to help the community. In particular, the Saad National Schools, the Saad Specialist Hospital and the Saad Centre for Communications Disorders represent the most telling manifestation of the Group&#8217;s approach to being a socially responsible company. Over the last decade, Saad&#8217;s interests have continued to grow and diversify, and now encompass a wide variety of specialised fields, with its divisions in healthcare, education, information technology and, of course, banking and finance. Headquartered in Al-Khobar, the Group now employs over 11,000 people and has operations throughout Saudi Arabia, as well as in Bahrain. Associated offices are located elsewhere in the world, including in London, Geneva and the Cayman Islands.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0007/5051/75051v1-max-150x150.png"],[[159,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/5051/75051v1-max-250x250.png"],[[159,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/5051/75051v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.engeneinc.com/mar_17_08.pdf","source_description":"enGene Inc. completes US$6.4M Series A Financing","raised_amount":6400000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"enGene","permalink":"engene","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0007/0313/70313v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[181,53],"assets/images/resized/0007/0313/70313v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[181,53],"assets/images/resized/0007/0313/70313v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
