They are exclusively focused on specific Quebec universities and use different business models.</p>\n\n<p>Incorporated in 2003, MSBi Valorisation resulted from the partnership of entrepreneurs and representatives from McGill University, University of Sherbrooke and Bishopâ€™s University who established this vehicle for financially supporting and bringing to market promising technologies.</p>\n\n<p>This effort started in 2001 as a part of the launch of SVUs through Valorisation-Recherche QuÃ©bec (VRQ), under the umbrella of a seed fund dedicated to technologies from McGill University, University of Sherbrooke and Bishopâ€™s University (MSBi, now iNovia Capital). Since 2003, iNovia Capital has extended its activities to other academic institutions in Quebec, Canada, and in the US, and provides a wider range of seed financing.</p>\n\n<p>MSBi Valorisation is a private company, incorporated in Quebec. From its inception in 2003 up to March 2008, MSBiV benefited from a loan provided by Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED-Q). Since 2006, MSBiV has benefited from a subsidy from the MinistÃ¨re du DÃ©veloppement Ã©conomique, de lâ€™Innovation et de lâ€™Exportation (â€œMDEIEâ€) for its operations. iNovia Capital also contributes to MSBiVâ€™s operations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,89],"assets/images/resized/0010/2820/102820v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,89],"assets/images/resized/0010/2820/102820v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,89],"assets/images/resized/0010/2820/102820v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"1155 RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque Boulevard West  ","address2":"Suite 2701  ","zip_code":"H3B 2K8","city":"Montreal","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.ethiopianreview.com/news/20041","source_description":"Leap Medical Raises C$1 Million","raised_amount":1010000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"Leap Medical","permalink":"leap-medical","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
