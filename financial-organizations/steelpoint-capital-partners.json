They look for innovative technologies that have the power to transform an industry or proven business models that have the opportunity to capture significant market share. They seek companies that have a deep understanding of their market with a strong view of the future and a strategic plan to get there. Because of their commitment to the success of their companies, they prefer to take a lead investor role and seek companies that align with the interests and background of their team. They primarily focus on media &amp; marketing services, IT &amp; communications, healthcare &amp; life sciences markets, consumer products &amp; retail, and business services &amp; other.</p>\n\n<p>Steelpoint utilizes its significant capital and human resources to support their investments. Their firm seeks to make investments between $5 and $30 million in leading middle market companies with strong underlying value and growth prospects. In general, they seek out companies that have a minimum of $5 million in revenue, are cash flow breakeven or have a clear path to profitability, with enterprise values up to $200 million.</p>\n\n<p>Their investment team has over a century of combined experience in principal investing &amp; entrepreneurial operations. They continually seek to support their portfolio companies by providing ongoing guidance on strategic direction, business development, talent recruitment and capital formation. Drawing on their network of corporate and financial relationships, they provide their teams with access to the resources needed to accelerate growth and reach market dominance.</p>\n\n<p>Steelpoint was formed in 2003 as a spin-out of the private equity group of Moore Capital Management.
