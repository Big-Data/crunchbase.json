Urbanization, industrialization, and population expansionâ€”along with economic integration under the North American Free Trade Agreementâ€”have combined to stimulate a vigorous discussion in border communities about environmental issues, sustainable development, and quality of life. Members of the public, NGOs, Indian tribes, and local and state government officials have all articulated the need for better information about the border environment. However, information access is a fairly difficult process that is complicated by the realities of the U.S.-Mexican border. There are many different agencies and different ways of operating on both sides of the border. In addition, the communities along the border have many similar problems such as air pollution or water quality issues but differ as to how these problems should be addressed. Many communities that want to become more involved in developing solutions for border environmental problems are handicapped by the lack of reliable, readily accessible information. Border environmental information includes not only monitoring data, but also information on what agencies and organizations are involved in dealing with border environmental issues.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0006/9133/69133v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0006/9133/69133v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/9133/69133v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"5500 Campanile Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"92182-4403","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal Investigator","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Paul Ganster","permalink":"dr-paul-ganster","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":11,"company":{"name":"CLASEMOVIL","permalink":"clasemovil","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0005/8200/58200v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0005/8200/58200v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,126],"assets/images/resized/0005/8200/58200v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
