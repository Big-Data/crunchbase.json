KVC might be viewed as an opportunistic investor focusing more on investing in exceptional or promising technology companies with seasoned management than in companies within specific business sectors. Over the years they have invested in early to mezzanine stage companies in the Healthcare, Life Sciences, Internet, Software, Communications, Specialty Retail, Manufacturing and other technology sectors. They focus primarily on companies located in the Puget Sound area of Washington although they have often invested in exceptional opportunities in other parts of the country or even abroad. KVC was founded in 1992 and is the General Partner of two very successful private venture investment funds. Since inception KVC Partnerships have invested in 36 portfolio companies. Of these only eight companies remain in our portfolio. The remaining 28 have exited the portfolio; 14 have gone public, 9 were sold to other companies (8 of which were sold to public companies or companies that later went public) and only 5 of the 36 were unable to succeed with their business venture. Their goal is to assist talented entrepreneurs in building successful businesses. Aside from our financial investment, as a partner with the companyâ€™s management team, they assist when needed on operational, strategic, financial and recruitment issues.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,100],"assets/images/resized/0004/7980/47980v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[126,100],"assets/images/resized/0004/7980/47980v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[126,100],"assets/images/resized/0004/7980/47980v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"221 First Avenue West, Suite 108","address2":"","zip_code":"98119-4223","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":47.6200383,"longitude":-122.3581014}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"KIRK","last_name":"LANTERMAN","permalink":"kirk-lanterman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,136],"assets/images/resized/0004/7981/47981v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,136],"assets/images/resized/0004/7981/47981v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,136],"assets/images/resized/0004/7981/47981v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Keller","permalink":"ken-keller","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5855/155855v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,240],"assets/images/resized/0015/5855/155855v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,240],"assets/images/resized/0015/5855/155855v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/Novariant_adds_40_Million_in_series_D_funding-nid-48362.html","source_description":"Novariant adds $40 Million in series D funding ","raised_amount":40000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":31,"company":{"name":"Novariant","permalink":"novariant","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0004/7838/47838v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/7838/47838v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[215,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/7838/47838v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.tiogaenergy.com/tioga-press-release-a-round.php","source_description":"Tioga Energy Completes $14 Million A-Round","raised_amount":14000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":6,"company":{"name":"Tioga Energy","permalink":"tioga-energy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0005/3119/53119v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/3119/53119v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[244,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/3119/53119v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/06/05/tioga-energy-gets-10m-to-offer-more-solar-power/","source_description":"Tioga Energy gets $10M to offer more solar power","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":5,"company":{"name":"Tioga Energy","permalink":"tioga-energy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0005/3119/53119v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/3119/53119v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[244,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/3119/53119v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
