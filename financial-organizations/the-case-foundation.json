Today, the foundation is pursuing a number of initiatives, and is particularly focused on three strategies; a) Encouraging collaboration; b) Supporting successful leaders; and c) Fostering entrepreneurship in the nonprofit sector.</p>\n\n<p>The foundation is applying these strategies to meet the needs of underserved children and families; create thriving and sustainable economic development for communities; bridge cultural and religious divides; expand civic engagement and volunteerism; and accelerate innovative approaches to health care.</p>\n\n<p>The foundationâ€™s work stretches across the United States and around the world. To date, they have supported more than 150 organizations that reflect our commitment to collaboration, leadership, and entrepreneurship â€“ and, ultimately, to improving the health and well-being of children, families, and communities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/8544/28544v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,72],"assets/images/resized/0002/8544/28544v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[244,72],"assets/images/resized/0002/8544/28544v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Head Office Washington DC","address1":"1717 Rhode Island Ave. NW","address2":"7th Floor","zip_code":"20036","city":"Washington","state_code":"DC","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.906605,"longitude":-77.039509}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Case","permalink":"steve-case","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7170/77170v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0007/7170/77170v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0007/7170/77170v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jean","last_name":"Case","permalink":"jean-case","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8617/28617v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/8617/28617v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/8617/28617v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director, Social Investment","person":{"first_name":"Kari","last_name":"Dunn Saratovsky","permalink":"kari-dunn-saratovsky","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director, Social Investment","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"michael-smith","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/01/snagfilms-closes-7m-equity-debt-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"SnagFilms Closes $7M Equity and Debt Financing","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"SnagFilms","permalink":"snagfilms","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/2275/22275v1-max-150x150.png"],[[232,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2275/22275v1-max-250x250.png"],[[232,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/2275/22275v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
