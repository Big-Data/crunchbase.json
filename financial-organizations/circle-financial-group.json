The founders recognized the need for a collaborative wealth management platform through which they could better organize their personal financial lives. Now a larger community of women, working in a trusted group environment, members share knowledge and access to the best financial thought leaders, investment managers and other wealth management providers.</p>\n\n<p>The mission is to provide our members with the information, framework, tools, and discipline for setting and working toward their financial and philanthropic goals. Through our proprietary process which includes weekly group meetings, the use of website, access to investment opportunities and daily information sharing, members are able to develop and implement investment policies for their families. The process includes asset allocation, ongoing investment manager due diligence and access to efficient practices in tax as well as trust and estate planning.</p>\n\n<p>The continuity, wisdom and discipline provided by the interaction of members in a consistent group setting enhances the ability of each member to invest more successfully than she could on her own.</p>\n\n<p>CFG is not an investment advisory firm - they are a collaborative gathering of like-minded women. Members of the group make investment decisions on their own or with the advice of their individual wealth management professionals.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0006/5201/65201v1-max-150x150.png"],[[232,30],"assets/images/resized/0006/5201/65201v1-max-250x250.png"],[[232,30],"assets/images/resized/0006/5201/65201v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":31,"company":{"name":"LearnVest","permalink":"learnvest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0005/8444/58444v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0005/8444/58444v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/8444/58444v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/accel-and-others-put-19m-in-female-focused-personal-finance-guide-learnvest/","source_description":"Accel And Others Put $19M In Female-Focused Personal Finance Guide LearnVest","raised_amount":19000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"LearnVest","permalink":"learnvest","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0005/8444/58444v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0005/8444/58444v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/8444/58444v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
