The organization&#8217;s mission is to select great application ideas for <a href=\"/product/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\" rel=\"nofollow\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"/product/ipad\" title=\"iPad\" rel=\"nofollow\">iPad</a>, finance them, and put the required resources together that end up having us go to market with a finished application on Appleâ€™s App Store.</p>\n\n<p>Labotec offers a relatively unique way of mobile app publishing, based on crowd-sourcing ideas from third parties. Basically, people who have ideas for mobile applications on any of the major platforms but lack the time, development skills or resources to actually build them can submit their ideas through the Labotec website.</p>\n\n<p>The ideas are subsequently evaluated by Labotec, and if one gets thumbs up from a committee of unnamed field experts associated with the company, Labotec funds the entire development, distribution and marketing of the app. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0005/1992/51992v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0005/1992/51992v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0005/1992/51992v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"20900 NE 30th Ave","address2":"Suite 210","zip_code":"33180","city":"Miami","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":25.9690885,"longitude":-80.1417742}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Florian","last_name":"Seroussi","permalink":"florian-seroussi-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,130],"assets/images/resized/0001/5233/15233v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,130],"assets/images/resized/0001/5233/15233v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,130],"assets/images/resized/0001/5233/15233v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Pierre-Olivier","last_name":"Carles","permalink":"pierre-olivier-carles","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6926/46926v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6926/46926v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/6926/46926v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Pierre-Olivier Carles</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Shareholder","person":{"first_name":"Stephane","last_name":"Menoret","permalink":"stephane-menoret","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"New funding.
