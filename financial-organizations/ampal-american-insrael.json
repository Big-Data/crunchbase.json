As a general guideline, Ampal seeks to acquire and maintain a sufficient interest in a company to permit it, on its own or with investment partners, to have a significant influence in the management and operation of that company. In determining whether to acquire an interest in a specific company, Ampal considers quality of management, return on investment, growth potential, projected cash flow, investment size and financing and reputable investment partners.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0006/8096/68096v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[170,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/8096/68096v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[170,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/8096/68096v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"10 Abba Even St., P.O.Box 12215 ","address2":"Ackerstein Tower C, 9th Floor","zip_code":"46733","city":"Herzliya","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2009/11/12/bridgewave-lands-2-4m-for-wireless-backhauling/","source_description":"BridgeWave lands $2.4M for wireless backhauling","raised_amount":2400000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"BridgeWave Communications","permalink":"bridgewave","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/1022/21022v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/1022/21022v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[179,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/1022/21022v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
