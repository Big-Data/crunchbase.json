In the â€œFunding Neededâ€ section of their website, new entrepreneurs and existing business owners can post their capital requirements. In the â€œLooking To Investâ€ section, investors, who are looking to invest, can post their profiles so that entrepreneurs can find them easily. Sometimes entrepreneurs may not need capital but may seek business partners or the opinions of other experienced investors or entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs can post these requests in their â€œBusiness Ideasâ€ section. In the â€œNeed An Expertâ€ section, entrepreneurs can find experts in their field of industry by posting their requirements. They can even advertise work for equity jobs for experts (e.g. CEO, CFO, or marketing manager). \nGo4Funding also allows all users to upload images and videos of their pitch. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/8709/28709v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/8709/28709v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/8709/28709v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1122 Kenilworth Dr","address2":"Suite 418","zip_code":"21204","city":"Towson","state_code":"MD","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.413732,"longitude":-76.629243}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Chandra","last_name":"S.
