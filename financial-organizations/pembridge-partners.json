They work in the space where marketing, media and technology meet, sharing risk with people who value their independence, value creativity and want to have fun making money.</p>\n\n<p>What sets Pembridge apart is their perspective as investors and real-world entrepreneurs. All their partners have &#8220;been there and done it before&#8221;, and they back their words with their own cash. They don&#8217;t talk gobbledegook and, if their advice sometimes seems very direct, their commitment is that they will always &#8220;tell it like it is&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Their mission is to be the first port of call for growth advice and funding for their kind of business. Together, they minimise risk and maximise economic impact, delivering outcomes that are truly measurable in terms of new jobs, investment and up-skilling.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/9559/29559v1-max-150x150.png"],[[202,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/9559/29559v1-max-250x250.png"],[[202,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/9559/29559v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"London","address1":"20 Orange Street","address2":"","zip_code":"WC2H 7EF","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5162888,"longitude":-0.1410282}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partners","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Adams","permalink":"mark-adams","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partners","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Tait","permalink":"andy-tait","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partners","person":{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"Lewis","permalink":"rose-lewis","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partners","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Prais","permalink":"david-prais","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[{"title":"UK","is_past":null,"provider":{"name":"Rebecca Caroe","permalink":"rebecca-caroe","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0003/2980/32980v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0003/2980/32980v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[342,300],"assets/images/resized/0003/2980/32980v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
