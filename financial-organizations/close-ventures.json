Our shareholder research shows that VCT investors consider dividend yield the most important investment consideration. Our funds are designed to provide a steady level of income. Our performance is testament to this and in the fourteen years since the first fund was launched, a dividend has been paid to shareholders, every year, totaling some Â£81 million - more than any other VCT manager.</p>\n\n<p>Albion Ventures LLP was created in January 2009 when it acquired the business of Close Ventures Limited from Close Brothers Group plc and is structured as a partnership formed by the former Close Ventures management team. We think it is appropriate that a business investing in owner-managed companies is itself owner-managed.</p>\n\n<p>We look to invest Â£1-10 million in a wide range of growing businesses, from technology orientated companies to service and asset-based businesses.</p>\n\n<p>We enjoy working with smaller companies and entrepreneurial management teams, seeing our purpose as helping businesses to grow by providing financial resources as well as strategic advice. Our ultimate aim is to realise the full potential of the business invested in and so create returns for the shareholders in our funds. We act with integrity and respect for the people we deal with.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0010/1157/101157v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,29],"assets/images/resized/0010/1157/101157v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[325,38],"assets/images/resized/0010/1157/101157v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"1 King's Arms Yard","address2":"","zip_code":"EC2R 7AF","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.psenterprise.com/news/data/070710_close%2520funding.pdf&pli=1","source_description":"PSE funding for gPROMS modelling worldwide expansion ","raised_amount":3040000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"Process System Enterprise","permalink":"process-system-enterprise","image":{"available_sizes":[[[81,82],"assets/images/resized/0008/3583/83583v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[81,82],"assets/images/resized/0008/3583/83583v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[81,82],"assets/images/resized/0008/3583/83583v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":6110000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"Blackbay","permalink":"blackbay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0008/4222/84222v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0008/4222/84222v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/4222/84222v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://corporate.helveta.com/uploads/news/20100107113748-061027%20Close%20Ventures.pdf","source_description":"Close Ventures leads funding of Helveta's timber traceability technology","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"Helveta","permalink":"helveta","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[194,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[194,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":9620000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Red-M Group","permalink":"red-m-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,36],"assets/images/resized/0010/0542/100542v1-max-150x150.png"],[[101,36],"assets/images/resized/0010/0542/100542v1-max-250x250.png"],[[101,36],"assets/images/resized/0010/0542/100542v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
