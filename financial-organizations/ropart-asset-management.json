RAM also makes opportunistic investments in distressed or special situations (e.g., secondary market purchases of private equity fund LP interests).</p>\n\n<p>RAM uses its proprietary network to source revenue collaborations, strategic alliances, M&amp;A transactions, and raise additional capital. Post closing, Ropart works actively alongside management to help build long-term company value.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, RAM uses its extensive relationships among senior executives and operating-level managers to provide business and technical expertise, management talent, and industry specific investment analysis to portfolio companies. RAM regularly relies on these executives to serve on our portfolio companiesâ€™ Boards of Directors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,75],"assets/images/resized/0004/7763/47763v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[146,75],"assets/images/resized/0004/7763/47763v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[146,75],"assets/images/resized/0004/7763/47763v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"One East Weaver Street","address2":"","zip_code":"06831","city":"Greenwich","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.017843,"longitude":-73.649877}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Todd","last_name":"A.
