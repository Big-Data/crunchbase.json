Since 1995, we have completed over 170 transactions and have acquired stakes in over 240 separate funds. Our ability to execute transactions quickly, professionally and privately has been recognized by both selling limited partners and the general partners of funds we acquire.</p>\n\n<p>Willowridge manages approximately $235 million of committed capital focused solely on private equity secondaries. Our most recent fund, Amberbrook IV LLC, was closed in 2005.</p>\n\n<p>We have acquired positions from a broad variety of sellers, including public and private pension funds, corporations, foundations and university endowments, as well as individuals. Our focus is primarily on purchases of older, smaller partnership interests, but we have the capacity to commit to larger transactions. Because investors range in size and have a variety of reasons for seeking liquidity prior to a fund&#8217;s final termination - including cash flow needs, changes in management or ownership, shifts in portfolio strategy, and simple administrative requirements - Willowridge is flexible with respect to fund vintages and transaction size. We have purchased stakes from both U.S. and international sellers. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/7447/27447v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/7447/27447v1-max-250x250.png"],[[268,94],"assets/images/resized/0002/7447/27447v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"25 East 86th Street","address2":"","zip_code":"10028","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.78101,"longitude":-73.959176}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jerrold","last_name":"Newman","permalink":"jerrold-newman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"O'Mara","permalink":"james-omara","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"Hunnewell","permalink":"luisa-hunnewell","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Bego","permalink":"michael-bego","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
