The firm offers entrepreneurs a viable option to traditional capital sources such as banks, venture capitalists, and angel investors, who typically move deliberately and have difficulty offering timely solutions that meet the complex capital requirements of rapidly growing companies.</p>\n\n<p>Montage&#8217;s venture loans Montage Capital - Speed Matters offer unique benefits. One of the key issues management teams face is how to achieve positive financial performance (i.e. revenue growth, profitability and positive cash flow) in a short market window without selling excessive amounts of their company (a.k.a. ownership). One way to achieve this objective is to secure venture debt, which is generally defined as a loan that is provided to a company with a financial condition unattractive to more traditional lenders.
