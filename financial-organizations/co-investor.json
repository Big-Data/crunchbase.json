We manage capital for around 50 family offices and high net worth individuals.</p>\n\n<p>We provide profitable small caps with a combination of the capital, skills and experience they need in order to reach their destination.</p>\n\n<p>We seek to invest a minimum of $10 million in each company, with shareholdings of at least 15% in businesses capitalised at $A50-200 million.</p>\n\n<p>We invest in the expectation that we will be shareholders in each of our investee companies for three to five years. When our job is done, we sell, preferably in a takeover that delivers value to all shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>We like to be viewed as a trusted partner with strong finance, strategy and operational skills, rather than simply as a source of capital.</p>\n\n<p>We roll our sleeves up to help make our investments work. This active approach requires us to limit the number of active investments we take on at any time.</p>\n\n<p>We invest significant amounts of our own money in the funds we manage.</p>\n\n<p>We minimise our exposure to property, resources, biotech and to start-ups.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/1163/101163v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[246,84],"assets/images/resized/0010/1163/101163v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[246,84],"assets/images/resized/0010/1163/101163v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Level 3 Barrack House 343 George Street","address2":"","zip_code":"2000","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2007/04/fonjax_raises_f.html","source_description":"FonJax Raises First Round For App Testing On Cell Phones","raised_amount":2200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"FonJax","permalink":"fonjax","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.triangle-venture.org/index.php?hid=4&shid=2&nid=2005_08_12","source_description":"fg microtec closes EUR 2.3 million Series B round ","raised_amount":2300000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"fg microtec","permalink":"fg-microtec","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,59],"assets/images/resized/0008/4797/84797v1-max-150x150.png"],[[118,59],"assets/images/resized/0008/4797/84797v1-max-250x250.png"],[[118,59],"assets/images/resized/0008/4797/84797v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
