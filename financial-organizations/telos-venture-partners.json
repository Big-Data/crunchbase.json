It has about $180 million under management. Telos typically invests between $1 million and $3 million per funding round. Its portfolio has included Alchemy Semiconductor (acquired by AMD), Coventor, PDF Solutions (now publicly held), and Xpedion Design Systems. Founded in 1995, Telos has close ties to Cadence Design Systems, the big EDA software and services vendor. Cadence was the sole limited partner in TVP&#8217;s first two investment funds. Telos is independently owned and operated, however.</p>","image":null,"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"339 S.
