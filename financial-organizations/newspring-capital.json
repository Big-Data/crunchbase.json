NewSpring Capital currently manages over $500 million across three distinct investment strategies through its family of funds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/newspring-ventures\" title=\"NewSpring Ventures\">NewSpring Ventures</a> is the venture capital arm of <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/newspring-capital\" title=\"NewSpring Capital\">NewSpring Capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Across all funds, NewSpring Capitalâ€™s investment professionals include eight partners with significant experience as private equity investors, operating managers, and industry leaders at the CEO level. The firmâ€™s highly cohesive investment team has a strong track record of investing in both private and public transactions, collectively representing more than 100 years of experience investing over $1 billion.</p>\n\n<p>All three NewSpring Capital funds work closely together. Yet each fund maintains its own dedicated senior management team, investment committee and limited partner advisory board. While in some cases the funds may co-invest, each fund operates independently, investing in non-competitive asset classes, stages, and industries.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/9272/29272v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[153,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/9272/29272v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[153,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/9272/29272v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Radnor Financial Ctr","address2":"555 E.
