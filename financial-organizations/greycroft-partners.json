We serve the founders and investors who have chosen us as their partners, and help them to build large, successful businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Greycroft was founded in 2006 based on two realizations.  First, advances in technology have allowed companies to scale with less direct investment.  Second, large venture funds have a tendency to over-capitalize early stage companies, eliminating many likely exit opportunities.  This is not done in a malicious way, but it is the natural outcome of large fund economics.  These two realizations led us to create a new type of venture firm that was intentionally small but had the network and access of a first tier venture fund.</p>\n\n<p>We set out to prove this concept in 2006, raising $75 million from corporate executives around the world.  Our first fund made 34 investments, including many successful business and consumer-focused companies, and is now among the top performing venture capital funds of its vintage.  In 2010 Greycroft closed its second fund with an additional $130 million, including many of the same investors, as well as participation from leading institutions.  The mission, team, and strategy remain the same.</p>\n\n<p>Greycroft invests between $500,000 and $5 million at inception, and will increase on a staged basis to double that amount over time.  We invest alone or alongside other firms, and will accept a board seat when appropriate, although a board seat is not a prerequisite when syndicating with others.</p>\n\n<p>Our portfolio companies benefit from active, hands-on assistance in all phases of expansion, including marketing, finance, and management development.  With offices in New York and Los Angeles, we also leverage an extensive network of media and technology industry connections to help our investees gain visibility, build strategic relationships, and successfully bring their products to market.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0001/9297/19297v1-max-150x150.png"],[[197,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/9297/19297v1-max-250x250.png"],[[197,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/9297/19297v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquaters","address1":"153
