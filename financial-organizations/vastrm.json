Last face it, most off the rack purchases just don’t fit right. Mass produced shirts were meant to accomodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size. Furthermore, different brands have standards for sizing. That is why many men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits! By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of our apparel, Vastrm will allow you to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for your unique body type. </p>\n\n<p>Once we have identified your ideal fit, you have the choice to purchase one of our curated designs OR style yourself with your own design. That’s right, your design. Via a simple visual configurator, we allow you to create your own polo shirts by selecting various trims for fabric, collar, cuff, pocket, side vents, and placket types. We aim to give people more choice in what they want to wear. We are here to put the “custom” back in customer and fun into online shopping!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/4239/114239v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0011/4239/114239v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,280],"assets/images/resized/0011/4239/114239v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Tang","permalink":"jonathan-tang","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/7128/177128v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[185,241],"assets/images/resized/0017/7128/177128v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[185,241],"assets/images/resized/0017/7128/177128v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
