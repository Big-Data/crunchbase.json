They formed Sippl Macdonald Ventures in August 1995 and since that time have invested in approximately 20 companies. They invest primarily in companies located in Silicon Valley. </p>\n\n<p>Sippl Macdonald has $30 million under management currently. Their investments range from $200,000 to $750,000 initially, and they expect to participate in all subsequent equity financings. They enjoy partnering with larger venture capital firms in many of the deals, while extending our collective operating experience to the portfolio companies regardless of investment size. </p>\n\n<p>The investment focus is on Internet and enterprise software opportunities. They seek investments in companies that have a talented and experienced management team, proprietary technology, and a market opportunity that can support the creation of a large business. Their evaluation begins with a review of the business plan, followed by a meeting with one or more partners. If they assess a fit and mutual interest, they proceed with the due diligence process, which involves researching markets, potential customers and competitors, assessing technical risks and technical robustness, and getting to know the management team, its &#8220;personality&#8221; and past business experiences. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0007/6298/76298v1-max-150x150.png"],[[190,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/6298/76298v1-max-250x250.png"],[[190,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/6298/76298v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1422 El Camino Real","address2":"","zip_code":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founding Partner","person":{"first_name":"Roger","last_name":"J.
