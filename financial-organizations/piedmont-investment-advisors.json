When Bill Militello, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, founded Piedmont Investment Advisors in 2003, he set out to create not just another financial advisor or boutique investment firm, but rather to create a new “category” in financial services.   His view is that the delivery of investment advice by financial advisors was ripe for innovation, and it has been Militello’s vision to challenge the conventional model. He believes that asset allocation should not be constrained to publicly traded stocks and bonds, and that the relationship between the client and the financial advisor should be free of conflicts.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0020/4568/204568v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0020/4568/204568v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[353,98],"assets/images/resized/0020/4568/204568v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"19455 Deerfield Avenue","address2":"Suite 307","zip_code":"20176","city":"Lansdowne (Leesburg)","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://news.yahoo.com/piedmont-investment-advisors-llc-makes-capital-investment-lemur-071348759.html","source_description":"Piedmont Investment Advisors LLC makes capital investment in Lemur Technologies, Inc.","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":6,"company":{"name":"Lemur Technologies","permalink":"lemur-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,147],"assets/images/resized/0020/4566/204566v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,245],"assets/images/resized/0020/4566/204566v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[256,251],"assets/images/resized/0020/4566/204566v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/09/venga-raises-venture-capital-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Venga Raises Venture Capital Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Venga","permalink":"venga","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/0493/180493v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,59],"assets/images/resized/0018/0493/180493v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,59],"assets/images/resized/0018/0493/180493v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/26/veenome-funding/","source_description":"Veenome Raises Another $600K To Translate Video Content Into Machine-Readable Data","raised_amount":600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"Veenome","permalink":"veenome","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/5733/145733v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0014/5733/145733v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0014/5733/145733v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
