They are a medium-sized, independent &#8216;boutique&#8217; with the resources to support intensive company research from their network of local offices. Throughout their history a local presence and cultural diversity have been important. For example, in 1993, they opened a representative office in Mumbai, one of the first foreign investment houses to establish a presence in India. In 1995, Lloyd George Management opened an office in London to centre their fund management and research activities in global emerging markets, followed by an office in Florida to focus their research efforts in Latin America. Their presence was further expanded in 2001 in Singapore and in 2006, in Tokyo. Across these offices they now employ 88 people in portfolio management and research, client service, administration and compliance. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/1540/31540v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/1540/31540v1-max-250x250.png"],[[355,74],"assets/images/resized/0003/1540/31540v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"London office","address1":"Fifth Floor","address2":"Nightingale House 65 Curzon Street","zip_code":"W1J 8PE","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Hong Kong office","address1":"Suite 3808","address2":"One Exchange Square Central","zip_code":"","city":"Hong Kong","state_code":null,"country_code":"HKG","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/296830_vc22.html","source_description":"WEBAROO LANDS FUNDS","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Webaroo","permalink":"webaroo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/1498/21498v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/1498/21498v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/1498/21498v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
