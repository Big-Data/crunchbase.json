Their investments are positioned in different segments of each of these markets to comprise a well diversified and balanced portfolio of companies.</p>\n\n<p>A professional investment team with extensive field expertise guides and supports entrepreneurs and portfolio companies throughout their life cycle, helping them to build a good idea into a leading company. With each member coming from a different background and contributing distinctive benefits, the investment team delivers a unique set of technical, operational and strategic skills.</p>\n\n<p>Evergreen has established strong ties with technological markets, creating an eco-system, from which they extract knowledge, understanding of the market needs and at the same time creating a valuable network to support their portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p>Evergreen sees its entrepreneurs as a key asset and therefore invests in the relationship to build a true partnership. Consequently many of Israel&#8217;s successful serial entrepreneurs have approached Evergreen with their next venture.</p>\n\n<p>Evergreen team&#8217;s disciplined investment strategy has been crystallized through more than 14 years of investment experience as a team and is one of the key elements responsible for Evergreen&#8217;s high rate of successful exits resulting in superior returns.</p>\n\n<p>Evergreen is directed by deep values of shared responsibility, rich interaction and dialogue, and hard work - its guiding principles since inception. They strongly believe in the continuity of their corporate culture which emphasizes investment in human capital, disciplined processes, professionalism and true leadership.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-150x150.png"],[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-250x250.png"],[[133,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/0648/30648v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"96
