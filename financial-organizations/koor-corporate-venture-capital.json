Koor generally invests in companies which operate in the global market and/or international companies and focuses on large-scale investments. Koor examines and invests in companies in which it has a position of control following the investment, as well as in companies in which Koor does not have a position of control following its investment. This, inter alia, in view of the market conditions and opportunities open in them, due to the decline in the market values of large international companies as a result of the economic crisis in the markets.</p>\n\n<p>Koor actively invests in agrochemicals through Makhteshim Agan Industries; in Finance through Credit Suisse; in telecommunications and technology through its holdings in Microwave Networks; in asset management through Epsilon Investment House; and in venture capital through Koor Corporate Venture Capital.  Also, recently, in April 2010, Koor (together with Properties &amp; Construction Co. of IDB Group) completed the purchase of the headquarters building of HSBC Bank on Fifth Avenue in the heart of Manhattan, considered one of the most attractive buildings in New York.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0010/4125/104125v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0010/4125/104125v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0010/4125/104125v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Triangle Tower","address2":"43rd Floor","zip_code":"67023","city":"Tel Aviv","state_code":null,"country_code":"ISR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":16000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Followap","permalink":"followap","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
