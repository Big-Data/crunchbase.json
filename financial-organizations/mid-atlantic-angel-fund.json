This member-managed fund provides its investors with an opportunity for active involvement in diversified venture capital investments throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, and Maryland.  The fund seeks to leverage various public and private funding resources and networks by providing equity capital to seed and early-stage, technology-based, high-growth companies.  Fund members include experienced entrepreneurs, high net worth individuals, institutions, and other accredited investors interested in realizing a high return on invested capital in Regional technology companies and being a key part of Regional growth.  Modeled after the best practices of other successful angel funds operating around the country, MAG is the first formally structured angel capital venture fund in the Greater Philadelphia Region and seeks to intelligently leverage Regional and statewide funding and other public and private partnership opportunities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/5145/45145v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/5145/45145v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/5145/45145v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Building 100 Innovation Center","address2":"4800 S. 13th St., Suite 200","zip_code":"19112","city":"Philadelphia","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Starr","permalink":"chris-starr-2","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Capital Funding Report","raised_amount":1800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":5,"company":{"name":"SkillSurvey","permalink":"skillsurvey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0004/5139/45139v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0004/5139/45139v1-max-250x250.png"],[[263,44],"assets/images/resized/0004/5139/45139v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.winwomen.org/content/view/175/2/","source_description":"Four Local Angel Investor Groups Come Together to Fund Nanopack Inc.","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"NanoPack","permalink":"nanopack","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0005/7716/57716v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0005/7716/57716v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[264,128],"assets/images/resized/0005/7716/57716v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/molecular-detection-inc-series-c-33m/","source_description":"Molecular Detection, Inc.: Series C $3.3M","raised_amount":4700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Molecular Detection","permalink":"molecular-detection","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0006/8272/68272v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0006/8272/68272v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[361,105],"assets/images/resized/0006/8272/68272v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/optinuity-receives-6-million-in-series-b-investment-58627212.html","source_description":"Optinuity Receives $6 Million in Series B Investment","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":19,"company":{"name":"Optinuity","permalink":"optinuity","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/0571/80571v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/0571/80571v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/0571/80571v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"e","source_url":"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-149027231.html","source_description":"sentitO Networks Secures $6 Million Financing Round for International Expansion;
