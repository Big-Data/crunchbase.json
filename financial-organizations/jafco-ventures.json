They look for exceptional companies with differentiated technology and compelling business models. Given their close relationship among all the leading venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, it is an investment requirement at their firm to co-invest in every deal with top-tier venture investors to help validate the opportunity and bring to their portfolio of companies the collective expertise needed to help assure a successful outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Strategic Added Value: All of the members of their team have significant venture capital and operating experience. They truly understand the challenges of entrepreneurial teams and have a lot of experience helping businesses scale to their potential. Jafco Ventures know how best to be very actively engaged when needed and they also know when it is best to simply provide encouragement from the sidelines. In addition, for those companies where it applies, we have the additional highly differentiated added value component of a proven business development team based in Tokyo, whose sole purpose is to aggressively pursue substantial revenue opportunities for their portfolio companies in a very time-efficient manner. This team of professionals has an extensive network of strategic relationships that very effectively leverage the JAFCO franchise value in Japan and other parts of Asia. As many of their portfolio companies will gladly testify, at JAFCO Ventures, their definition of value-add is quite tangible and readily measurable.</p>\n\n<p>Investment Process: Since JAFCO Ventures are organized to work collectively as a team on each deal, they pride themselves on their responsiveness to entrepreneurs and commit to making investment decisions in a very timely manner. JAFCO Ventures is the lead investor in almost all of their financings since they have the expertise to determine valuation, set sensible terms and align the interests of all the investors and management in their deal structures. Their typical initial investment size is $4 million to $8 million depending on the level of maturity of the company and the size of its financing requirements.</p>\n\n<p>They intentionally keep their fund sizes modest to ensure that they act in an optimal manner for the benefit of all of their constituentsâ€”the entrepreneurs they back, the partners with whom they co-invest and the limited partners they serve.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0000/3562/3562v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3562/3562v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3562/3562v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Palo
