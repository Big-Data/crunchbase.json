OAF operates independently of, but in close collaboration with Oregon Entrepreneurs Network (OEN).  OEN does not have a financial interest in OAF.  Several organizations donate time and resource to operate the fund, including OEN, Capybara Ventures, Ater Wynne, Geffen Mesher, and local MBA programs. </p>\n\n<p>OAF encourages veteran and new angel investors to â€œlearn by doing,â€ with the aim of increasing the number of active local angel investors and funded startups in Oregon and SW Washington.   OAF&#8217;s one-year investment horizon is designed to encourage decision-making, diversification, and learning, as well as to further position PAN  as the most-active venue for funding startups in Oregon and SW Washington. </p>\n\n<p>Comprised of 50+ accredited investors, OAF seeks to invest in four early-stage growth companies per year.  Investments may be made in companies operating in any industry and targeting any market. </p>\n\n<p>To be considered for an investment by OAF, a company must apply to PAN and be selected to present at a PAN meeting.   Companies cannot apply directly to OAF.  An investment decision could be made as quickly as 8-10 weeks after a company applies, however, actual time-to-funding may take longer.  While all OAF members are PAN and WIN members, other PAN and WIN members may desire to invest in a company alongside OAF or independent of OAF.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/3579/143579v2-max-150x150.png"],[[145,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/3579/143579v2-max-250x250.png"],[[145,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/3579/143579v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Main","address1":"1120
