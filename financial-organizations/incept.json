Our technologies improve the in vitro manipulation, performance, and viability of high-value cells, and our mission is to set the standard for next-generation clinical devices for the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) laboratory.</p>\n\n<p>Like many specialized cells, human embryos typically behave much differently while in vitro than they would in the body, and this performance gap can limit their developmental growth and potentially their viability. Inceptâ€™s System for Microfluidic Assisted Reproductive Technology (SMART) platform is the first to deliver unique control of in vitro cell culture environments so that fertility specialists can offer patients new hope in starting a family.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0006/6938/66938v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0006/6938/66938v1-max-250x250.png"],[[372,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/6938/66938v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"401 W.
