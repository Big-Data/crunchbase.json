The historian Sir Martin Gilbert and Lord Freud, former vice chairman of UBS Investment Banking, are the other trustees.</p>\n\n<p>The Portland Trust is a private British foundation committed to encouraging peace and stability between Palestinians and Israelis through economic development. It promotes initiatives to develop the private sector, particularly in the Palestinian Territory. The core approach is to identify particular bottle-necks in the economy and to apply appropriate expertise to develop solutions. The problems identified are often complicated by issues of security and require the mobilisation of international resources. Once a solution has been developed, The Portland Trust works to implement the initiative. This can involve obtaining the support and commitment of the relevant parties, identifying appropriate sponsors and mobilizing the necessary funds.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0010/3095/103095v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[204,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/3095/103095v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[204,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/3095/103095v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"42 Portland Place ","address2":"","zip_code":"W1B 1NB","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://blog.seattlepi.com/venture/archives/114711.asp","source_description":"Experticity lands $2.7 million for retail system","raised_amount":2700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"eXperticity","permalink":"experticity","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
