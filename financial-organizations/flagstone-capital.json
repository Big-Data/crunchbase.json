The firmâ€™s mission is to promote Joint Venture relationships between developers and investors who require transactional equity, and institutional capital providers seeking reliable partners.</p>\n\n<p>The firm was founded by Larry Heath. A descendant of the Heath candy bar family, Larry grew up in a small mid-west town with a work ethic and integrity passed on to him by three previous generations of socially responsible entrepreneurs and CEOs. When it came time to sell the company his great grandfather founded, Larry decided to apply his skills and values to a profession in commercial real estate. After fifteen years of practice in the industry, spanning investment brokerage, development and property management, Larry Heath founded Flagstone Capital on the bedrock of his broad experience in development and investment and the family values with which he was raised. </p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-coveritlive-gets-1-million-round-for-liveblogging-tech/","source_description":"CoverItLive Picks Up $1 Million Round For Liveblogging Tech","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":29,"company":{"name":"CoverItLive","permalink":"coveritlive","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/2355/22355v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/2355/22355v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/2355/22355v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
