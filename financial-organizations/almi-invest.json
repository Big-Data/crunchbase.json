ALMI Invest consists of seven, regionally based venture capital funds, all with local offices and experienced local investment managers. We manage a total of SEK 1 billion.\nUnlike most venture capitalists, we can invest in a wide range of businesses. A strong team of entrepreneurs, a scalable business model and an initial revenue stream are more important than the line of business when we invest.\nOur first, initial investment would typically be SEK 2-4 million. During the lifetime of an investment, sums of up to SEK 10 million can be ventured. We always syndicate with an investment partner â€“ another venture capitalist or angel investor, from Sweden or otherwise â€“ which means that in a new share issue or convertible bond, we can acquire a maximum of 50 per cent of the shares.\nALMI Invest was founded in 2009 by ALMI FÃ¶retagspartner together with regional investors. Half of our capital comes from European Union structural funds, which accounts for an investment of SEK 500 million. The other 50 per cent comes from regional investors and ALMI FÃ¶retagspartner.\nThe yield we generate is reinvested, which means that ALMI Invest is what is known as an Evergreen Fund.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0009/9812/99812v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,65],"assets/images/resized/0009/9812/99812v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[157,65],"assets/images/resized/0009/9812/99812v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"
