For companies like these, the New Ventures group offers important advantages.\nFirst of all, and most important, our New Ventures partners are fully integrated into Biogen Idec. This instantly expands both funding and available resources. With the long and expensive process of getting drugs to market, having a partner like Biogen Idec is invaluable.\nIn addition, an association with Biogen Idec validates the enterprise in a way other venture capital does not. In fact, being part of our New Ventures group may make it easier to attract other investors, employees and other vital constituents.\nOur New Ventures partners also benefit from the expertise of our executives. While the company retains rights to their products and technology, we typically only invest in companies in which we can play an active role.\nWe approach our New Ventures partnerships as strategic investments, with minimal regard to short-term ROI. That&#8217;s why, for example, we are interested in companies that are outside our traditional therapeutic areas of neurology, oncology and immunology.\nGenerally, we invest $1-5 million initially, but we expect to participate in subsequent financing.\nFor companies that just need financing, there are other options. But for a company looking for help getting a product on the market quickly, Biogen Idec&#8217;s New Ventures group is a compelling alternative.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,58],"assets/images/resized/0010/0424/100424v1-max-150x150.png"],[[141,58],"assets/images/resized/0010/0424/100424v1-max-250x250.png"],[[141,58],"assets/images/resized/0010/0424/100424v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"5200 Research Place","address2":"","zip_code":"92122","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2009/12/calcimedica-closes-second-tranche-of.html","source_description":"CalciMedica Closes Second Tranche of $12M Series C Financing","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"CalciMedica","permalink":"calcimedica","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/8731/48731v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,58],"assets/images/resized/0004/8731/48731v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[248,58],"assets/images/resized/0004/8731/48731v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
