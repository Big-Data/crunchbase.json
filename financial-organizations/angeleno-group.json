AG makes investments broadly across the energy industry to support innovative, well-managed, rapidly growing companies.</p>\n\n<p>Angeleno Group believes that a series of fundamental changes in the energy and environmental industries are generating significant private equity opportunities. These changes revolve around three major themes: (1) the need for energy independence, (2) the requirements of a stable and reliable energy infrastructure, and (3) imperatives relating to environmental sustainability. Taken as a whole, these themes affect the entire sector value chain &#8211; from the extraction of natural resources and the conversion of fuels into electricity to the distribution of energy and the way in which power is ultimately consumed. In each case, innovative products and services are emerging as potential solutions to global energy and environmental challenges.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0003/2060/32060v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/2060/32060v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/2060/32060v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2029
