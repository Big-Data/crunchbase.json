With an emphasis on technology software, hardware and services, NextStage Capital&#8217;s goal is to find talented entrepreneurs with a compelling and validated technology offering and help them build company value.</p>\n\n<p>NextStage Capital&#8217;s partners have invested over $175M of early stage capital and helped build many venture-backed companies in the area. Having participated in many exits, as well as having worked with companies through difficult situations, the partners offer a comprehensive perspective and experience to entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>NextStage Capital&#8217;s involvement does not end with providing capital and strategic advice. Often the difference between failure and success comes down to one or two key hires and the timing of those hires is critical. NextStage Capital invests in founders for the long term and we look to surround those founders with the best people at the right time. NextStage Capital integrates recruiting into the venture model because their experience has shown that having the right people at the right time is the single most important factor of success.</p>\n\n<p>They actually help their portfolio companies recruit experienced, proven executives who complement the existing management team. NextStage Capital offers these recruiting services as a value add through our partnership with TWC Group, a human capital firm with more than a decade of experience building management teams for many of the region&#8217;s most successful venture-backed companies.</p>\n\n<p>At NextStage Capital, their team is committed to partnering with their portfolio companies. They provide the capital, the contacts and the operational expertise necessary to drive growth. In this way, entrepreneurs can go back to concentrating on their core competencies while NextState Capital focuses on theirs: launching promising companies into success.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/9392/29392v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/9392/29392v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/9392/29392v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"2570 Blvd. of the Generals,,","address2":"Suite 110","zip_code":"","city":"Audubon","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.1266654,"longitude":-75.4035546}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Adams","permalink":"robert-adams","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Terry","last_name":"Williams","permalink":"terry-williams","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"McKinney","permalink":"dan-mckinney","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://newteevee.com/2007/02/12/magnifynet-raises-12-million/","source_description":"","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Magnify","permalink":"magnify","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.agilenceinc.com/agilence_pr_11_18_2008.htm","source_description":"Agilence Closes $4 Million in Funding","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Agilence ","permalink":"agilence","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0003/1475/31475v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/1475/31475v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,140],"assets/images/resized/0003/1475/31475v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-draft-online-video-tools-platform-magnify-closes-1-million-funding/","source_description":"paidcontent.org","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"Magnify","permalink":"magnify","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://newteevee.com/2009/03/16/anysource-raises-32m-for-web-vid-on-tv/","source_description":"AnySource Raises $3.2M for Web Vid on TV","raised_amount":3200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"AnySource Media","permalink":"anysource-media","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/8536/38536v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,83],"assets/images/resized/0003/8536/38536v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,83],"assets/images/resized/0003/8536/38536v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.centernetworks.com/magnify-net-funding-vc","source_description":"Magnify.net Grabs Series A1 Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"Magnify","permalink":"magnify","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/0118/118v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/253545/agilence-secures-2-million-venture-capital-funding","source_description":"Agilence Secures $2 Million in Venture Capital Funding.","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Agilence ","permalink":"agilence","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0003/1475/31475v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/1475/31475v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,140],"assets/images/resized/0003/1475/31475v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-155473371.html","source_description":"HardMetrics Inc.
