We believe the middle tier of the technology market, technology companies with revenues between $15 million and $150 million, is a highly attractive investment area. We target mid-market technology companies with differentiated products and competitive positioning that generate positive free cash flows and have a demonstrated track record of growth.</p>\n\n<p>We pursue transactions across multiple segments of the technology industry, including software (whether in a traditional license model, or delivered with a software-as-a-service-model), Internet technologies and IT enabled services. Specifically, we are active in a wide range of sub-segments, including enterprise and infrastructure software, vertical market application software, technical software, networking software, enterprise computing and data storage, storage networking, data communications, Internet services, business process outsourcing and professional IT services.</p>\n\n<p>Accel-KKR focuses primarily on three types of transactions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Acquisitions and recapitalizations of closely-held private companies</li>\n<li>Buyouts of divisions, subsidiaries and business units from public companies</li>\n<li>Going-private transactions of small public companies</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/0162/80162v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/0162/80162v1-max-250x250.png"],[[303,79],"assets/images/resized/0008/0162/80162v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board
