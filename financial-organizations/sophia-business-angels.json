Today, the group numbers 50 + strong, hails from 15 countries stretching from South America to North America to the Middle East and to Europe, and has a proven serious interest to invest early in local, national, and international start-up projects which bring a significant return on investment. Given the groupâ€™s combined expertise in finance, ICT, Bio, and Energy, the SBA Members have been able to work as a club to find, fashion, and fund investments for their members throughout the world. This success has led to the SBA being one of the first recipients of a French national grant for Business Angels. It has also led to the SBA members founding 2 investment vehicles, Innovation Europe and Croissance Europe, together with Meeschaert Gestion PrivÃ©e to lead private investing throughout Europe. As a result, the SBA was chosen to host the EASY Cross-Border Investment Forum 20/21 November during the French Presidency of the European Union as well as the parallel event France Angels â€œSemaine des Business Angelsâ€ day on 21 November 2008.  The events were featured projects from around Europe and France in the MedTech, CleanTech, Hi-Tech, and Space Sectors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[72,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/6152/46152v1-max-150x150.png"],[[72,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/6152/46152v1-max-250x250.png"],[[72,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/6152/46152v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"300 Route des CrÃªtes","address2":"06902 Sophia Antipolis","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":43.3752329,"longitude":-1.7171521}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Jean-Luc","last_name":"Nahon","permalink":"jean-luc-nahon","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Secretary General","person":{"first_name":"Annie","last_name":"Prod'homme","permalink":"annie-prodhomme","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":233000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"Exploredge","permalink":"exploredge","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0004/6033/46033v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0004/6033/46033v1-max-250x250.png"],[[271,82],"assets/images/resized/0004/6033/46033v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.webtimemedias.com/webtimemedias/wtm_article49293.fr.htm","source_description":"Sophia: a fund raising â‚¬ 1.1 million for 3Roam","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"3ROAM","permalink":"3roam","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,71],"assets/images/resized/0005/7220/57220v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[143,71],"assets/images/resized/0005/7220/57220v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[143,71],"assets/images/resized/0005/7220/57220v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
