So what does that mean? It means they make investments in small companies, mostly private. Why? Because they believe the growth potential is greater in the small to mid-cap arena.</p>\n\n<p>They hold their investment truths to be self evident. Their beliefs are supported by their 25 year history. Thatâ€™s right. They were a BDC long before it recently became a â€œhotâ€ investor category.</p>\n\n<p>They invest in solid little guys before they get big. They look for small to mid-cap companies that are performance driven and just need time to hit their stride. They want portfolio companies that have good management, good earnings, market position and excellent growth potential. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0636/30636v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0636/30636v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0636/30636v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"Clayton","permalink":"sharon-clayton","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Moore","permalink":"tony-moore","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Denos","permalink":"ken-denos","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"Douglass","permalink":"paula-douglass","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Forbes","permalink":"gary-forbes","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.nwinnovation.com/fullstory/0014915.html","source_description":"Infinia Raises $7M (Total B = $57m)","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Infinia","permalink":"infinia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.nwinnovation.com/infinia_gets_$50m_for_solar_power_products/s-0013711.html","source_description":"Infinia Gets $50M For Solar Power Products","raised_amount":50000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"Infinia","permalink":"infinia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-150x150.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-250x250.png"],[[208,62],"assets/images/resized/0001/8449/18449v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
