The founding company, McCallum Hill Limited, was created in the same year by Walter H.A. Hill and E.A. McCallum. McCallum Hill Limited specialized in real estate development and insurance. Today, it is under the umbrella of The Hill Companies, along with Harvard Developments Inc., which is the primary operating entity and which focuses on real estate development, asset management and property management. All are headquartered in Regina, Saskatchewan.</p>\n\n<p>The Hill Companies are a model of diversity and achievement. Over the years, the 2nd and 3rd generation owners, Fred and Paul Hill, firmly established themselves as leaders in real estate development and in the business community at a national level.
