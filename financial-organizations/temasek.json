More recently, to mark our 35th anniversary, we gifted another S$100 million to the Temasek Trust, this time to support Temasek Cares for community programmes in Singapore.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/6020/96020v2-max-150x150.png"],[[201,108],"assets/images/resized/0009/6020/96020v2-max-250x250.png"],[[201,108],"assets/images/resized/0009/6020/96020v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"60B Orchard Road","address2":"#06-18 Tower 2 ","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704188104575082712757100660.html?mod=googlenews_wsj","source_description":"Temasek, Li Ka-shing Foundation Invest in SecondMarket ","raised_amount":15000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"SecondMarket","permalink":"secondmarket","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/1649/31649v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/1649/31649v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0003/1649/31649v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/amyris-biotechnologies-inc-series-d-478m/","source_description":"Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc.: Series D $47.8M","raised_amount":47800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"Amyris Biotechnologies","permalink":"amyris-biotechnologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,110],"assets/images/resized/0005/7507/57507v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[95,110],"assets/images/resized/0005/7507/57507v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[95,110],"assets/images/resized/0005/7507/57507v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.pacificepoch.com/newsstories?id=23275_0_5_0_M","source_description":"Harbour Networks Raises US$37M  ","raised_amount":37000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Harbour Networks Holdings","permalink":"harbour-networks-holdings","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.portola.com/pdfs/Portola_Pharmaceuticals_Announces_Completion_of_89_Million_Financing.pdf","source_description":"Portola Pharmaceuticals Announces Completion of $89 Million Financing","raised_amount":89000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"Portola Pharmaceuticals","permalink":"portola-pharmaceuticals","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0016/0000/160000v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[232,81],"assets/images/resized/0016/0000/160000v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[232,81],"assets/images/resized/0016/0000/160000v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"f","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/13/marin-software/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Venturebeat_deals+%28VentureBeat+%C2%BB+Deals+%26+More%29","source_description":"Ad startup Marin Software takes a late-stage $30M","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Marin Software","permalink":"marin-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6944/16944v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0001/6944/16944v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0001/6944/16944v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
