In 2003, Braveheart Investment Group plc was incorporated, and subsequently acquired Braveheart Ventures. The transition towards becoming a recognised investment management company was completed in 2004 when Braveheart Ventures became authorised by the Financial Services Authority. In March 2007 Braveheart Investment Group plc became a listed company when its shares began trading on AIM.</p>\n\n<p>The organisation has grown steadily year on year and now comprises a management team of twelve and a client base of around 100. Braveheart currently has over 30 companies in its diverse portfolio and enjoys close relationships with several universities and science parks. The Groupâ€™s headquarters are in Perth and there is a regional office in central London.
