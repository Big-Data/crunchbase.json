Growth potential is the key criteria. The BGF will invest between Â£2m and Â£10m per business in return for a minimum 10 per cent equity stake and a seat on the board for a BGF director. The Fund will provide long-term equity investment for those growing companies that today do not have access to this source of capital.  As such the BGF hopes to be a catalyst for growth among smaller UK companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0015/7482/157482v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,132],"assets/images/resized/0015/7482/157482v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,132],"assets/images/resized/0015/7482/157482v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"One Victoria Square","address2":"","zip_code":"B1 1BD","city":"Birmingham","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/10/benefex-receives-4-2m-investment-business-growth-fund.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Benefex Receives Â£4.2M Investment from the Business Growth Fund","raised_amount":4200000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Benefex Group","permalink":"benefex-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0009/9733/99733v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0009/9733/99733v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[402,135],"assets/images/resized/0009/9733/99733v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/10/statesman-travel-group-receives-4-25m-growth-investment-business-growth-fund.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Statesman Travel Group Receives Â£4.25M Growth Investment from Business Growth Fund","raised_amount":4250000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":19,"company":{"name":"Statesman Travel Group","permalink":"statesman-travel-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0015/8826/158826v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,70],"assets/images/resized/0015/8826/158826v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[328,93],"assets/images/resized/0015/8826/158826v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/02/gci-telecom-group-receives-10m-equity-investment-business-growth-fund.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"GCI Telecom Group Receives £10M Equity Investment from Business Growth Fund","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"GCI Com","permalink":"gci-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0017/3705/173705v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0017/3705/173705v1-max-250x250.png"],[[365,76],"assets/images/resized/0017/3705/173705v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/03/wow-stuff-receives-4-8m-investment-business-growth-fund.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Wow!
