They do this by:</p>\n\n<p>-Finding the right talent and backing it</p>\n\n<p>-Tapping the collective intelligence to solve problems and improve decisions</p>\n\n<p>-Redefining processes to put more intelligence into software</p>\n\n<p>-Dramatically lowering transaction costs, creating new categories of products and services </p>\n\n<p>As a result,they&#8217;ve created a balanced portfolio of initiativesâ€”long-term and short, high risk and sure thing, never been tried and retried at the right time, too theoretical to work and so obvious it must have been tried long ago.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, their two biggest passions are changing how Internet security is done and improving healthcare by industrializing therapy development. Both of these initiatives utilize the Internet to radically alter the status quo, introducing novel approaches to long-standing problems.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/9066/29066v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[75,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/9066/29066v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[75,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/9066/29066v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Palo Alto Office","address1":"169 University Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.4443931,"longitude":-122.1631392}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Shrager","permalink":"jeff-shrager","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/9103/29103v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[101,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/9103/29103v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[101,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/9103/29103v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Director / Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Allan","last_name":"Schiffman","permalink":"allan-m-schiffman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9105/29105v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9105/29105v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9105/29105v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager, Special Projects","person":{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"Dehnow","permalink":"martha-dehnow","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9102/29102v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9102/29102v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9102/29102v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CommerceNet Fellow","person":{"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"Dusseault","permalink":"lisa-dusseault","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9104/29104v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[102,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9104/29104v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[102,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/9104/29104v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CommerceNet Fellow","person":{"first_name":"Rachna","last_name":"Dhamija","permalink":"rachna-dhamija","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"CommerceNet ","raised_amount":225000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Angstro","permalink":"angstro","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/4816/24816v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,126],"assets/images/resized/0002/4816/24816v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,227],"assets/images/resized/0002/4816/24816v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Powerset","permalink":"powerset","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0000/3934/3934v1-max-150x150.png"],[[231,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3934/3934v1-max-250x250.png"],[[231,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3934/3934v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"ChipIn","permalink":"chipin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0733/20733v1-max-150x150.png"],[[127,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0733/20733v1-max-250x250.png"],[[127,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0733/20733v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://pejolaGames.com","title":"pejolaGames - Android games"}]}
