They are able to meet the needs of entrepreneurs who choose to leverage today&#8217;s technologies and adopt efficient go to market strategies to launch and prove out their businesses with far less capital. They seek to invest in startups needing $500k - $1.5 million as a first venture capital Seed or Series A round and they generally look for opportunities that are within the Internet, software and mobile sectors.  Nueva Ventures&#8217; mantra is to:</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Keep burn low by creatively using resources\nâ€¢ Release early, release often\nâ€¢ Prove out the model, then ramp\nâ€¢ Maintain flexible exit options</p>\n\n<p>As veterans of the technology sector and entrepreneurs, Nueva Ventures have sat in the shoes and they know that building a successful business is one of the most challenging and emotional things you can do.
