Berkery in 1983, Berkery Noyes has worked with corporate clients to grow through acquisition, divest non-core assets, and maximize shareholder returns through strategic transactions and restructurings. For private owners, Berkery Noyes helps create liquidity and execute timely exit strategies.</p>\n\n<p>Berkery Noyes strives to understand the unique aspects of every client&#8217;s operation, and does not hesitate to advise against a transaction if it appears not to serve the client&#8217;s long-term interests. This philosophy is further reflected in Berkery Noyes&#8217; commitment to offering independent, unbiased advice that is untainted by conflicts and cross-selling that arise with institutions with broader and more varied financial services and product offerings.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4266/104266v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0010/4266/104266v4-max-250x250.png"],[[290,56],"assets/images/resized/0010/4266/104266v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1 Liberty Plaza","address2":"","zip_code":"10006","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"W.
