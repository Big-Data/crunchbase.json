The technologies must create an impact for the underserved in emerging markets, including but not limited to Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>\n\n<p>Invested Development believes that innovative technology can contribute to the reduction of global poverty. Despite real progress and impact, decades of international aid and donor-supported programs have left nearly 1.5 billion people in abject poverty. ID recognizes that we must merge the heart of the social sector with the efficiency of the free market to finish what they started.</p>\n\n<p>Why Mobile Technology?</p>\n\n<p>Mobile communications have experienced the fastest adoption of any technology in history. There are over five billion mobile phones in the world. Even in emerging markets, mobile penetration has been on an explosive climb in the last five years.</p>\n\n<p>We invest in mobile transaction systems that leverage the high mobile penetration rates for scale and impact. Mobile transactions systems can extend access to information and financial services and provide opportunities for social networking and participation to underserved populations.</p>\n\n<p>Why Alternative Energy?</p>\n\n<p>Over 1.4 billion people in the world live in energy poverty. This means that they have no access to electricity, or their energy source is unsafe and unreliable. Consequently, over 500 million mobile phone users cannot keep their phones charged. For these reasons, we seek to invest in storage, management, and harvesting solutions that are a safe and sustainable alternative to the grid or kerosene. Micro energy systems provide energy at the human, household, and small village scale to populations beyond the reach of reliable grid energy or safe alternatives.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0017/7710/177710v2-max-150x150.png"],[[154,103],"assets/images/resized/0017/7710/177710v2-max-250x250.png"],[[154,103],"assets/images/resized/0017/7710/177710v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"711 Atlantic Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"02111","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Africa Office","address1":"Upper Hill Estate, 4th Floor","address2":"Bishop Magua Centre George Padmore Lane","zip_code":"02120","city":"Nairobi","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"Granier","permalink":"miguel-granier","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0643/180643v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0643/180643v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0643/180643v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Invested Development</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Manager","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Bashian","permalink":"alex-bashian","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0644/180644v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0644/180644v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0644/180644v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Invested Development</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing and Research Manager","person":{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"Tamer","permalink":"christina-tamer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0645/180645v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0645/180645v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0645/180645v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Invested Development</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Sean","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"sean-smith-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0646/180646v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0646/180646v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[93,128],"assets/images/resized/0018/0646/180646v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Invested Development</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Carter","permalink":"lee-carter","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investment Intern","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Coogan","permalink":"john-coogan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/0647/180647v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/0647/180647v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/0647/180647v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-zevin/impact-investing-new-kid-_b_1148376.html","title":"Huffington Post - Impact Investing: New Kid on the Block?"},{"external_url":"http://www.nextbillion.net/blog/2011/07/06/the-not-so-dangerous-promise-of-impact-investing","title":"NextBillion - The (Not So) Dangerous Promise of Impact Investing"},{"external_url":"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2080702,00.html","title":"TIME - Mobile Phones Transform Africa"},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/us/10bcweber.html","title":"New York Times â€“ Impact Investing"},{"external_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2010/06/28/daily8-Defense-titan-Raytheon-working-with-solar-tech-startup-Promethean.html","title":"MassHighTech - ID Portfolio company Promethean Power"}]}
