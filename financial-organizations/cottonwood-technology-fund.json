It aims to cultivate the entrepreneurial community of the Paso del Norte region running along the Rio Grande River from Los Alamos, New Mexico to El Paso, Texas. It is an area rich in resources, host to two federal labs (Los Alamos and Sandia), two medical centers (the University of New Mexico Health Services Center and the Texas Tech University Health Services Center at El Paso), and four engineering schools and research universities (UNM, UTEP, NM Tech and NM State). Collectively, they represent more than $4.0 billion in annual research across critical fields such as Bio-Sciences, New Energy, Nanotechnology, Information Technologies, CleanTech and Aerospace. CTF will work to provide venture services and capital to tech transfer opportunities having strong commercial potential. They borrowed their name from a tree native to the region. The Rio Grande Cottonwood—a welcome sight to pioneer desert caravans because it often signaled water—typically reaches 50 to 60 feet in height and can produce as many as 25 million seeds in a season. CTF aims to be as fruitful with its work.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0018/3267/183267v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0018/3267/183267v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[373,292],"assets/images/resized/0018/3267/183267v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"406 W.
