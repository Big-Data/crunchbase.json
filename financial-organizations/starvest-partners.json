Their differentiation is derived from the combination of the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Their history of success in their targeted investment sectors - technology-enabled business services.</p></li>\n<li><p>Their focus geographically across all U.S. business centers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Their research-driven, proactive investment process.</p></li>\n<li><p>Their demonstrated ability to help drive portfolio company revenue.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>StarVest differentiates itself through its expertise and deep domain knowledge of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), a key area of opportunity for StarVest. They have e invested in as many successful SaaS companies as StarVest, or started investing in as early a time frame (beginning 1999).</p>\n\n<p>When they invest in geographic areas that are less well served by either national or local venture firms (such as Ohio, Arizona, Chicago), they find that their industry expertise is a major attraction for potential portfolio companies. This is because they have more extensive domain knowledge than most other venture funds, and they can provide potential partnership and customer introductions through their contacts in the New York that are in their industries or target customer base. These potential portfolio companies value having a New York-based investor with extensive relationships within the advertising, financial services, media, publishing industries with a wide network of Fortune 1000 executives. They can either be complementary with or provide an alternative to a regional investor.</p>\n\n<p>StarVest also distinguishes itself from its competition by making significant customer and partnership introductions &#8211; what growing companies need most. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0003/0866/30866v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[170,107],"assets/images/resized/0003/0866/30866v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[170,107],"assets/images/resized/0003/0866/30866v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"750 Lexington Avenue","address2":"59th Street","zip_code":"10022","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.7626372,"longitude":-73.9678814}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"E.Kelly","permalink":"robert-e-kelly","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"Farrington","permalink":"deborah-a-farrington","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/2548/32548v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,223],"assets/images/resized/0003/2548/32548v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,223],"assets/images/resized/0003/2548/32548v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"Mariani Sullivan","permalink":"jeanne-mariani-sullivan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/8226/88226v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/8226/88226v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/8226/88226v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>StarVest website</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Of Counsel","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"L.Veron","permalink":"richard-l-veron","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"Farrington","permalink":"deborah-farrington","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Associate","person":{"first_name":"Edlyn","last_name":"Yuen","permalink":"edlyn-yuen","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"B.
