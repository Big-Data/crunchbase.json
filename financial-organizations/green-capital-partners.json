Reducing carbon emissions, expanding renewable energy capacity and improving energy efficiency are crucial elements of energy policies in Europe and in Italy with governments understanding the need for flexible, market-based approaches.\n\n* There is a general lack of direct experience regarding renewables as it relates to closed-end, institutional funds, but increasingly, proven investment managers are surfacing from both financial institutions and the operating side. As a result, the space is rapidly emerging\n\n* An increasing number of sophisticated institutional investors have identified clean energy as a discrete and attractive strategy. This interest is reinforced by the following:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>1) the profitability and growth of the sector,</p>\n\n<p>2) significant investment to date, </p>\n\n<p>3) leadership and success of Europeâ€™s clean energy focus,</p>\n\n<p>4) the insatiable and growing demand for energy from transition economies mainly in Asia,</p>\n\n<p>5) the mainstreaming of the clean energy market sector, and </p>\n\n<p>6) a new level of commitment by governments that have moved away from whether climate change is occurring to what are we going to do about it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>* The next decade will mark a period of significant capital investment in clean energy that, matched with sophisticated managers, should provide great opportunities for capital appreciation and growth.\n\n* Green Capital Group is raising a Euro 200 Million Private Equity fund dedicated to the space. The team has over  60 years of cumulative experience in energy and private equity.\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/0637/70637v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0007/0637/70637v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,158],"assets/images/resized/0007/0637/70637v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarter","address1":"Piazza Sant Ambrogio 4","address2":"","zip_code":"20123","city":"Milano","state_code":null,"country_code":"ITA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Paolo","last_name":"G.
