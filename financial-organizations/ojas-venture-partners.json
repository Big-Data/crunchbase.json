They recognize that with the help of such professionals, the value they can add to their portfolio companies can be magnified several fold. They are actively seeking to partner with such professionals who are passionate about helping young companies succeed. They recognize the limitations on their time given their current jobs; however, they believe that for their engagement with Ojas and their companies to succeed they should be willing to â€˜adoptâ€™ a portfolio company and commit a minimal amount of quality time &amp; energy to the engagement. The Gurus should be able to help with validation of market &amp; technology, guide in execution and provide access to customers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/0351/30351v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[127,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/0351/30351v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[127,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/0351/30351v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"#772, 3rd Floor, 80 Ft.
