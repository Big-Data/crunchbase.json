Few investment groups specialize in investing $50k to $2 million in early-stage companies and even fewer bring a broad value-add network to support entrepreneurs. The Seraph Investor Network was founded with the vision of providing capital and support  in an expedient and efficient manner without geographic prejudice. Our Investor Network reaches 21 cities and spans three continents. The reach provides valuable expertise to entrepreneurs and investors.</p>\n\n<p>Seraph Group is comprised of a diverse group of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technology leaders across wide array of different industries. By leveraging this expertise, Seraph Group is able to evaluate and invest in venture scalable opportunities across most industries. Investments range from $50K to $1.5 million and can participate along any financing stage of the company. While Seraph Group is comprised solely of angel investors, the investment process mimics a traditional venture capital firm where there is a fund managed by a small investment team. This pool of â€œsmartâ€ capital brings singular access to a prestigious group of individuals that are all invested in an entrepreneurâ€™s business and its success.</p>\n\n<p>In todayâ€™s market, companies have proven that only a relatively small amount of capital infusion, under $1 million, is enough to build a venture scalable business. However, most entrepreneurs will attest, that raising $500K to $1.5 million, is the hardest amount of capital to raise because it is too small for traditional venture firms. Seraph Groupâ€™s focus is to fill this unmet need in the market for professional, smart capital.</p>\n\n<p>The primary investment criteria for companies raising money is for it to be a venture-scalable business and not a life-style business. Seraph Group will consider investing in any round of financing and has often invested alongside later-stage venture firms.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0003/2055/32055v1-max-150x150.png"],[[239,127],"assets/images/resized/0003/2055/32055v1-max-250x250.png"],[[239,127],"assets/images/resized/0003/2055/32055v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Atlanta
