All of the foundationâ€™s grantmaking and advocacy efforts support this mission.\n.\nThe foundation sets clear priorities because we can have the greatest impact by staying focused. Certain problems affect millions of peopleâ€”diseases in developing countries, low high school graduation rates in the United States, low crop yields in Africa. In our priority areas, we work on long-term solutions for people with the most urgent needs.</p>\n\n<p>The Gates Foundation makes grants in three program areas: Global Development, Global Health, and the United States. Each program area has a policy and advocacy team dedicated to raising awareness of problemsâ€”and solutionsâ€”to motivate change. Their work includes public affairs, to increase interest in the issues and strengthen the voice of the public; grantmaking to organizations that support our mission; and public education, to provide policymakers and others with information on issues.</p>\n\n<p>Our grantmaking process involves four key steps: developing strategy, making grants, measuring progress, and adjusting strategy. Our approach emphasizes partnership, innovation, risk, and, most importantly, results. Achieving the results we want requires\nthe flexibility to learn from mistakes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0008/4159/84159v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/4159/84159v1-max-250x250.png"],[[259,52],"assets/images/resized/0008/4159/84159v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Chair","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Gates","permalink":"bill-gates","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7609/17609v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7609/17609v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,285],"assets/images/resized/0001/7609/17609v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Chair","person":{"first_name":"Melinda","last_name":"Gates","permalink":"melinda-gates","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman of the Advisory Board","person":{"first_name":"Rajat","last_name":"Gupta","permalink":"rajat-gupta-4","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"grant","source_url":"http://www.nanobio.com/NanoBio_RSV_Gates.html","source_description":"NanoBio Receives $6 Million to Develop an Intranasal Vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"NanoBio","permalink":"nanobio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/2282/52282v1-max-150x150.png"],[[218,77],"assets/images/resized/0005/2282/52282v1-max-250x250.png"],[[218,77],"assets/images/resized/0005/2282/52282v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2012/10/08/daily28-Genocea-raises-30M-to-advance-herpes-vaccine.html","source_description":"Genocea raises $30M to advance herpes vaccine","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"Genocea Biosciences","permalink":"genocea-biosciences","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0009/8416/98416v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,106],"assets/images/resized/0009/8416/98416v1-max-250x250.png"],[[256,109],"assets/images/resized/0009/8416/98416v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.pehub.com/172755/visterra-adds-13m-wrap-up-series-a/","source_description":"Visterra Adds $13M to Wrap Up Series A","raised_amount":13000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"Visterra","permalink":"visterra","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0009/6987/96987v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/6987/96987v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/6987/96987v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://pevc.dowjones.com/article?an=DJFVW00020121119e8bjqm1g7&from=alert&pid=32&ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fpevc.dowjones.com%3a80%2farticle%3fan%3dDJFVW00020121119e8bjqm1g7%26from%3dalert%26pid%3d32","source_description":"BetterLesson Books $3.5M From Gates Foundation for Educational Sharing","raised_amount":3500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":19,"company":{"name":"BetterLesson","permalink":"betterlesson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0013/2682/132682v1-max-150x150.png"],[[247,69],"assets/images/resized/0013/2682/132682v1-max-250x250.png"],[[247,69],"assets/images/resized/0013/2682/132682v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
