They now invest their time and money in othersâ€™ early stage software and Internet startups through Tandem.</p>\n\n<p>The Tandem team does not consider itself a VC firm. They refer to three primary types of capital that are required to make a startup successful â€“ Financial Capital (money), Human Capital (sweat) and Social Capital (friends). Tandem explains that VCs bring mainly financial capital, some social capital and limited sweat, while Tandem brings value in the reverse order â€“ sweat, friends and money (much more like entrepreneurs).</p>\n\n<p>Tandem supports businesses that can be built with relatively few resources (5 people or less) and reach market traction in relatively little time.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0016/0437/160437v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0016/0437/160437v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0016/0437/160437v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1214
