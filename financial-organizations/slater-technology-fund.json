The Fund is financed annually by the General Assembly.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, Slater Technology Fund has:</p>\n\n<p>a) Provided financing to more than 90 technology ventures in Rhode Island.</p>\n\n<p>b) Invested $15 million in state funds into companies that have raised more than $174 million in private, VC and government investments.</p>\n\n<p>c) Successfully recruited numerous out-of-state companies.</p>\n\n<p>d) Backed ventures that have created high-value jobs in the state, and offer the potential for even greater job creation in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Slater focuses its resources on industry sectors deemed to be particularly well suited to developing an innovation-based economy in Rhode Island: These industry sectors fall under two broad categories::</p>\n\n<p>-Life Sciences</p>\n\n<p>-Information Technology</p>\n\n<p>Slater provides up to $3 million annually in seed funding for local technology-based ventures in these two categories. This seed funding â€“ combined with the deep industry knowledge and network of strategic partnerships that Slater provides â€“ often serves as the critical catalyst that enables a company to successfully make the transition from the lab to the investment stage and/or product sales.</p>\n\n<p>Slater also maintains incubator space at Richmond Square in Providence.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0003/0384/30384v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0003/0384/30384v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[289,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/0384/30384v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Providence Office","address1":"3 Davol Square, Mailbox 188,","address2":"Suite A301","zip_code":"02903","city":"Providence","state_code":"RI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"G.
