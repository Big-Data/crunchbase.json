They invest in technology based companies with significant growth potential. \nFerd Venture is a business area in the Ferd group. Ferd sees venture capital investments as an attractive asset allocation, and therefore takes a long-term approach to its venture capital involvement. With Ferd as the only limited partner, they have a great deal of flexibility in terms of the amount of capital we invest in each deal, as well as the timing of exits. This distinguishes from most other venture investors, and allows to focus consistently on value creation and follow portfolio companies until the optimal exit time.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0003/4587/34587v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0003/4587/34587v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0003/4587/34587v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Strandveien 50","address2":"P.O.
