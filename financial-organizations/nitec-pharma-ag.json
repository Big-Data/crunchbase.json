It seeks to address areas of high unmet medical need within these markets by developing proprietary products based on well-characterized pharmaceuticals and disease targets. The Company is a spin-out of Merck KGaA and is headquartered in the Basel region of Switzerland. Since its formation in 2004, Nitec has developed and commercialized its lead product, Lodotraâ„¢.</p>\n\n<p>Nitecâ€™s most advanced product candidate is Lodotraâ„¢, a circadian cytokine modulator, which successfully completed a European phase 3 trial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2006. In January 2009, Lodotraâ„¢ was recommended for European regulatory approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (â€œRAâ€), particularly the associated and debilitating morning stiffness, following the successful completion of a phase III trial (CAPRA-1) in 2006. Germany was the Reference Member State and Lodotraâ„¢ is now also expected approvable by the regulatory agencies of 14 other countries under the Decentralized Procedure. In March Nitec announced a European partnership for Lodotraâ€™s commercialization with MundiPharma. Merck KGaA, which holds the distribution rights to Lodotraâ„¢ in Germany and Austria, have recently launched the product in Germany.</p>\n\n<p>Nitec is conducting a second pivotal phase 3 trial in preparation for the filing of an NDA with the FDA seeking US approval of Lodotraâ„¢ for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of RA including morning stiffness. Lodotraâ„¢ is also being developed for the treatment of severe asthma and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).</p>\n\n<p>Nitecâ€™s second product candidate is TruNocâ„¢ (tarenflurbil), which is being developed as a treatment of neuropathic pain and other chronic inflammation and pain-related diseases. Nitec is conducting pharmacokinetic studies in preparation for phase 2 trials in neuropathic pain.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/2985/72985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[140,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/2985/72985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[140,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/2985/72985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"KÃ¤genstrasse 17","address2":"","zip_code":"CH-4153","city":"Reinach","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHE","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"Joseph-Meyer-Str. 13-15","address2":"","zip_code":"D-68167","city":"Mannheim","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Anders","last_name":"HÃ¤rfstrand","permalink":"anders-hrfstrand","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Interim CFO and Head of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"E.
