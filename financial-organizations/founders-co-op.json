It offers financing as well as business advice and other opportunities to 2-4 person companies looking to take a great idea to a product.   The initial fund size was $2 million.</p>\n\n<p>Founder&#8217;s Co-op provides seed investments ranging from $10,000 to $250,000, depending on the needs of the company receiving funding. In addition to simply receiving seed funding, every founder (or founding team) is asked to contribute 5% of the equity in their company to the Founders Pool. In exchange, the founders receive an ownership stake in every other company funded by the Co-op in that calendar year. This pooled equity interest among Founders creates a tangible incentive to share ideas, information and support with other Founders Co-op companies.</p>\n\n<p>The entity was founded by Andy Sack and Chris DeVore.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/7598/17598v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7598/17598v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[379,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/7598/17598v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Seattle","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":47.620716,"longitude":-122.347533}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General
