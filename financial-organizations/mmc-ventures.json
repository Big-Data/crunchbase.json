With Â£78m under management (as at October 2010), including a Â£30 million committed Enterprise Capital Fund, MMC puts c.Â£8-10 million to work each year. MMC also has a Syndicate of experienced private investors who invest alongside the managed funds.</p>\n\n<p>MMC addresses the equity gap in the UK with initial investments of between Â£500,000 and Â£2 million. As an active investor MMC works in partnership with management teams to maximise shareholder value. Investing in growth companies requires more than just money - we accelerate growth through operational, financial and strategic advice, and by leveraging the mentor capital available from our investors.</p>\n\n<p>Since it began in 2000, MMC has established a strong track record of growing and selling businesses. MMC was named EIS Fund Manager of the Year by the EIS Association at the House of Commons in January 2009 (runner-up in 2010), was reported as one of the top five most active investors in private equity (Unquote&#8221;, January 2010), and has been highly rated by both the Tax Efficient Review and Tax Shelter Report.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0006/1622/61622v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0006/1622/61622v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,207],"assets/images/resized/0006/1622/61622v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2
