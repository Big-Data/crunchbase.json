The foundation is funded solely by donations and bequests of its founders.</p>\n\n<p>In Africa:\nFoundation Descroix-Vernier is particularly involved in financing the construction of wells in Africa, in partnership with â€œHydraulique Sans FrontiÃ¨resâ€. These wells are autonomous; an economy of solidarity is created in each village concerned, closed to women places in the village. These women are trained in maintenance and repair of wells. Wells are practical and intelligent &#8220;designed&#8221; (protective barriers of the human zone, recovery of water and splashing around a watering drainage for animals). The outstanding work of â€œHydraulique Sans FrontiÃ¨resâ€ Engineering and foundation Descroix-Vernier financing, have already driven hectoliters of water in desert areas.\nEach well is part of a long-term program launched by the Fondation Descroix-Vernier which aims to build 12 wells in affected areas on the African continent.</p>\n\n<p>In France:\nThe fondation Descroix-Vernier provides financial support through several programs against poverty and disease in France. For example, the Foundation actively supports Professor Etienne-Emile Baulieu and his team of researchers at INSERM, in their fight against neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Founding members:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corinne Chatal, Vice-Chairman of Rentabiliweb Group, Chairman of the Monitoring Committee of Rentabiliweb Europe SAS (Director)</li>\n<li>Pierre Achache, Chairman of Oxone Technologie, Group Neuf - Cegetel.
