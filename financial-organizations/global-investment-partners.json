As a fairly untapped market, Africa presents an opportunity for attractive returns and portfolio diversification.</p>\n\n<p>Their goal is to structure efficient, well managed companies capable of implementing projects with a social economic impact on the lives of Africans and at the same time provide attractive returns for their investors. Implementation will be done through a pooled investment vehicle using funds from investors mainly in the US, EU and Asia. </p>\n\n<p>During the first investment phase (2007-2011), the majority of their work will be concentrated in East Africa primarily Rwanda and will target priority economic sectors like infrastructure, energy and agricultural value addition. As a company, their greatest value-added is detail orientation in packaging and presenting investment-ready projects to their investors. </p>\n\n<p>This includes idea origination, pitch book and business plan preparation, due diligence, pre-feasibility studies, risk mitigation, deal structuring and eventual project execution; all of which are possible due to their strong knowledge of the local business environment and carefully developed strategic relationships. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, they seek to leverage their expertise in US capital markets in the provision of innovative financing solutions and cross-border consultancy services to their global clientele ranging from small businesses to public institutions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0002/8668/28668v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/8668/28668v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,76],"assets/images/resized/0002/8668/28668v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3168 33rd Street","address2":"Suite 2B ","zip_code":"11106","city":"Long Island City","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.7619467,"longitude":-73.9231893},{"description":"","address1":"Avenue de la Paix","address2":"P.O.
