BANSEA has network connections to angel groups in China, India, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as close links to groups in Europe and the US.  Our members have investment experience spanning multiple sectors and a track record in building successful companies.</p>\n\n<p>BANSEA organises 10 to 12 events in a year for our members to meet and listen to short pitches by start-ups shortlisted by our Screening Committe. Members may or may not invest as a group. While there could be collaboration on due dilligence, members exercise autonomy in making investment decsions. Start-ups that have successfully raised seed capital through our members also benefit from their value-added mentoring. Members benefit from an informed and collaborative approach to angel investing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0010/0340/100340v1-max-150x150.png"],[[193,131],"assets/images/resized/0010/0340/100340v1-max-250x250.png"],[[193,131],"assets/images/resized/0010/0340/100340v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"30 Biopolis Street #09-02 Matrix","address2":"","zip_code":"138671","city":"Singapore ","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Poh Kam","last_name":"Wong","permalink":"poh-kam-wong","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/1264/71264v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[148,200],"assets/images/resized/0007/1264/71264v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[148,200],"assets/images/resized/0007/1264/71264v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Evdemon","permalink":"chris-evdemon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/6269/66269v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[118,163],"assets/images/resized/0006/6269/66269v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[118,163],"assets/images/resized/0006/6269/66269v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Chris Evdemon</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Member","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Tan","permalink":"james-tan","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/2710/142710v2-max-150x150.png"],[[210,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/2710/142710v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,356],"assets/images/resized/0014/2710/142710v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
