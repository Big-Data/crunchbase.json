However, as demonstrated by the trend of Chinese and Indian companies going outside the borders of their respective home countries to acquire metals, minerals and energy related assets, the Directors believe the growing demand for natural resources in China and India will be deeply intertwined with supply from international markets, in particular the emerging and resource rich markets of Africa, South-America, and South-East Asia.</p>\n\n<p>ORP seeks to invest between US$5 million and US$20 million over the life-cycle of an investment (capped at 20 per cent. of the Net Asset Value of the Company at the time of investment). However, on a case-by-case basis the Board may consider investments which represent a larger proportion of the Net Asset Value of the Company should the Board deem that the risk and reward profile justifies such investment.</p>\n\n<p>ORP predominantly seeks to acquire substantial minority interests in investments, holding between 10 and 40 per cent. of the investee companyâ€™s equity. On a case-by-case basis, the Company will also consider smaller or larger, stakes should the Board deem that the risk and reward profile justifies such investment.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/0859/50859v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/0859/50859v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[134,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/0859/50859v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Non Executive Chairman","person":{"first_name":"NIGEL","last_name":"TAYLOR","permalink":"nigel-taylor","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Non Executive Director","person":{"first_name":"CHARLES","last_name":"EDMUND WILKINSON","permalink":"charles-edmund-wilkinson","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2008/07/18/halosource-raises-115m-for-water-purification/","source_description":"HaloSource raises $11.5M for water purification","raised_amount":11500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"HaloSource","permalink":"halosource","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0005/0857/50857v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0005/0857/50857v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[440,131],"assets/images/resized/0005/0857/50857v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
