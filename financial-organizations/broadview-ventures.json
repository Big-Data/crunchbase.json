(Broadview) was established in 2008 as a new program conceived by the Leducq family. Through Broadview, the trust will work to accelerate the development of promising technology in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease through targeted investment in and support of early stage technology ventures.</p>\n\n<p>The Foundation Leducq, based in Paris, France, is the beneficiary of a charitable trust. In order to further the Foundation Leducqâ€™s mission in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease, the trust has made funds available to Broadview to develop a program which will promote early state technology in these fields through investments, licensing agreements and consortium funding arrangements, as well as professional, management and consulting support.</p>\n\n<p>With this initiative the trust joins other leaders in the venture philanthropy movement in seeking creative solutions to the problem of what is commonly referred to as the â€˜translational gapâ€™, a significant component of which is a lack of funding at a critical moment in the development of new technology and science.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/6698/56698v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0005/6698/56698v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/6698/56698v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Address","address1":"P.O.
