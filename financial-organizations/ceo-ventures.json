The MAC will formalize CEO Ventures' support of its early-stage tech companies in order to help them avoid these key points of failure and increase their odds of success. The MAC will house and utilize powerful new processes and best practices in surveying prospect needs, programming new products, high performance marketing, and best of class sales processes to systematically  solve each of these key points of failure (for details see the MAC tab at www.CEOVentures.com).\r\nWhile Seed Stage investing continues to yield some of the highest returns in private equity (example study at www.alturl.com/o8wi), the vast bulk of these returns are made by a relatively few high performers commonly dubbed \"Outliers\". Of the few select startups that are able to obtain professional funding in the U.S., about 1 in 10 yields high returns above 10X with the rest barely returning the capital investing or complete write-offs. Two keys to success in Seed Stage investing are to, a) own shares in a wide portfolio of well vetted startups to increase the odds of owning an outlier, and b) help these startups overcome the most common points of failure to increase the average success rate. CEO Ventures is dedicated to these key investment principles.\r\nDori Lindsey has joined the company as Director of the Market Acceleration Center which will be centrally located at Atlantic Station in Midtown Atlanta.
