To date, they have helped build over 150 companies and they are currently investing their sixth fund. They are pleased to say that they have put over $1.1 billion to work for those companies.</p>\n\n<p>Their  partners are entrepreneurs themselves, having formed, run and sold multiple companies across a spectrum of industries. Their professional staff brings financial, legal, product development, marketing and operations support to the firm and the partners at Enterprise draw on their experience when working with their portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs often ask them what they look for in a company. Typically, they look at large emerging markets and markets undergoing fundamental changes along with the companies that they believe will become leaders in these markets and they look for talented people with innovative business models that can create or transform these large markets.</p>\n\n<p>They are open-minded regarding the specific types of businesses they fund but they are currently looking most actively at businesses in the life sciences.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/0632/30632v1-max-150x150.png"],[[225,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0632/30632v1-max-250x250.png"],[[225,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0632/30632v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2223
