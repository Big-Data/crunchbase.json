Members invest in and mentor high quality start-up and early-stage companies in these sectors, mostly in the Cambridge (UK) area, although we are also interested in investment opportunities elsewhere in the south of England.</p>\n\n<p>Typical funding requirements that the Cambridge Angels meet are in the range of Â£50,000 to Â£500,000 - although it is worth noting that several of our portfolio companies have received more than Â£1m in funding from our Members over several funding rounds.</p>\n\n<p>Our Members have been responsible for a large number of the â€œCambridge Phenomenonâ€ success stories over recent years. Therefore, in addition to providing funding for early-stage companies, the Cambridge Angels also offer start-ups the considerable benefit of a wide range of expertise, contacts and directly relevant experience in establishing and growing entrepreneurial businesses successfully.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/1544/21544v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/1544/21544v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,71],"assets/images/resized/0002/1544/21544v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder
