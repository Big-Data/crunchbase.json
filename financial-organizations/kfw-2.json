As a promotional bank under the ownership of the Federal Republic and the LÃ¤nder (federal states), it offers support to encourage sustainable improvement in economic, social, ecological living and business conditions, among others in the areas of small and medium-sized enterprise, entrepreneurialship, environmental protection, housing, infrastructure, education finance, project and export finance, and development cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>KfW Bankengruppe has also become a strategic partner of business and politics. As an adviser to the German federal government they provide expertise in the privatisation of federally owned companies. This is complemented by additional tasks on behalf of the German government.</p>\n\n<p>Global Loans\nTo provide financing in other countries KfW Bankengruppe is granting global loans to partner banks throughout Europe, enabling them to extend medium and long-term investment loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and to finance private residential building projects that target environmental and climate protection.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-Task Environmental Protection\nAs a promotional and development bank acting on behalf of the German federal government and the federal states, KfW Bankengruppe is also under a particular obligation to protect the environment.</p>\n\n<p>Funding\nTo fulfil its promotional mission KfW Bankengruppe uses a high leverage: the international capital market. Funding for the large number of reduced-interest promotional loans is virtually provided by bulk-buying. KfW Bankengruppe raises EUR 60-70 billion in the capital markets every year and is thus the fifth-largest capital market issuer in Europe after the governments of Italy, Germany, France and the UK.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0006/8115/68115v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,105],"assets/images/resized/0006/8115/68115v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,105],"assets/images/resized/0006/8115/68115v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Palmengartenstrasse
