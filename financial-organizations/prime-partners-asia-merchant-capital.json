Its partners, both individuals and corporations, encompass a range of skills and business linkages allowing PPG to offer a comprehensive set of services from raising capital (both debt and equity, mezzanine to public offerings) to mergers and acquisitions; from specialized investor relations advisory to private equity, opportunistic mezzanine and pre-IPO investing.</p>\n\n<p>PPG is especially active across the spectrum of financial advisory and investing services in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand with established offices in each capital city.  An office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam was added in 2006.</p>\n\n<p>PPG first set up PrimeEast Capital in 1994 to do investment banking in South East Asia and Hong Kong. In 1997 together with Banque Nationale de Paris, it established BNP-PrimeEast. BNP-PrimeEast changed its name to BNP Prime Peregrine in 1998 following the acquisition of the Peregrine Groupâ€™s broking and corporate finance operations in Hong Kong and Greater China. PrimePartners sold its interest in BNP Prime Peregrine in late 1999 at which time the organization had grown into a major investment banking and stockbroking group in Asia employing over 600 people in East and South East Asia.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,79],"assets/images/resized/0007/3536/73536v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[198,105],"assets/images/resized/0007/3536/73536v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[198,105],"assets/images/resized/0007/3536/73536v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"One Raffles Place #30-03  OUB Centre","address2":"","zip_code":"048616","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"SGP","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Teo","last_name":"Ek Tor","permalink":"teo-ek-tor","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Shick","permalink":"lee-shick","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.nwinnovation.com/halosource_raises___m_for_clean_water_tech/s-0026079.html","source_description":"Northwest Innovation","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":7,"company":{"name":"HaloSource","permalink":"halosource","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0005/0857/50857v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0005/0857/50857v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[440,131],"assets/images/resized/0005/0857/50857v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
