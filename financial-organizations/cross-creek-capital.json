Portfolio companies are selected through a process of deep due diligence utilizing Wasatch&#8217;s time-tested investment discipline of bottom-up, fundamental analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Cross Creek Capital&#8217;s investment team is comprised of seasoned members of Wasatch&#8217;s research team: Karey Barker, Ajay Krishnan and Sam Stewart. The investment team works with the entire Wasatch research team of more than thirty portfolio managers and analysts to support Cross Creek Capital&#8217;s investment activities.</p>\n\n<p>Wasatch&#8217;s reputation and experience as a disciplined public company investor has led to relationships with top venture capitalists and corporate management teams. As a result, Cross Creek Capital believes it has access to both deals and years of experience evaluating and monitoring investments that differentiate it from other venture capital investors.</p>\n\n<p>Wasatch&#8217;s public company experience also provides a relevant basis for assessing a private company&#8217;s potential to successfully enter the public markets and for estimating the valuation it may achieve as a public company. This experience guides the Cross Creek Capital investment team as it seeks exit points for liquidating an investment after a company goes public.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/6896/46896v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[176,91],"assets/images/resized/0004/6896/46896v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[176,91],"assets/images/resized/0004/6896/46896v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"150
