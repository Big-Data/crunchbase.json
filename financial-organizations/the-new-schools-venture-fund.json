Since our founding in 1998, NewSchools has invested $180 million in more than 70 nonprofit and for-profit educational organizations working to promote student achievement. Recognizing that neither private charity nor capital markets alone are enough to solve the problem of education inequality, we blend the best of both approaches to ensure an excellent education is available to every child. We actively share what weâ€™ve learned through our investments, bring together educational leaders from across the country, and advocate for smart policies at the federal level.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0008/0795/80795v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0008/0795/80795v4-max-250x250.png"],[[400,89],"assets/images/resized/0008/0795/80795v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1970
