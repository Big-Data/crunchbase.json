Through Technion Seed, these funds invest in high market potential technological ideas and ventures, that are still at an early stage and with very high uncertainty. The investment in such ventures â€“ initially up to about $1,000,000 â€“ is made both directly by the funds and indirectly through Technion Seed. The purpose of the initial investment is to enable the entrepreneurs to prove the viability of their idea. Success in the initial phase will then lead to a large round of financing by the funds, for continued growth of the venture. Technion Seed and its owners invest in a wide variety of areas, including communications, IT, internet, medical devices, renewable energy, new materials and more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0007/1670/71670v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/1670/71670v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,57],"assets/images/resized/0007/1670/71670v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"MATAM Advanced Technology Center","address2":"Building No. 30, P.O.
