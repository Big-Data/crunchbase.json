To this end it contains articles that analyze U.S. imperialism and neoliberal globalization as well as social justice, human rights, race, gender and environmental issues. It also contains articles that examine  alternative ideas and projects that promote post-capitalist societies based on human development and ecological sustainability. The name “Beyond Capital” denotes a society that has moved beyond domination by capitalist elites—who use their personal wealth as capital primarily for the purpose of accumulating more capital and personal wealth—and instead utilizes its collective potential and productive powers in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all. In short, ”Beyond Capital” denotes a society that focuses on human need rather than human greed.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0020/9585/209585v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0020/9585/209585v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[390,121],"assets/images/resized/0020/9585/209585v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Lumi Mobile","permalink":"lumi-mobile","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0013/2778/132778v2-max-150x150.png"],[[226,90],"assets/images/resized/0013/2778/132778v2-max-250x250.png"],[[226,90],"assets/images/resized/0013/2778/132778v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
