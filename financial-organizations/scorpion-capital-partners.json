Scorpion seeks to partner with proven management teams to invest in middle market companies that we believe are competitively positioned for strong future performance. </p>\n\n<p>Scorpion invests in a wide range of industries, and typically focuses on companies that can benefit from aspects of our involvement that go beyond simply providing capital, such as strategic planning and development; mergers, acquisitions and divestures; arranging senior and subordinated financing and other capital markets activities; and access to our extensive personal and professional relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The partners of Scorpion bring together a combined 40 years of direct private equity investing experience.  In addition, each brings other relevant experiences that provide Scorpion with the ability to add other complementary disciplines to our investments, such as investment banking, venture investing, restructuring and distressed investing and M &amp;A due diligence and auditing experience.</p>\n\n<p>Scorpion makes investments in partnership with management, where senior members of each management team make a meaningful investment alongside Scorpion, therefore ensuring an alignment of interests.  While Scorpion does not take an active role in managing its portfolio companies day to day, we are actively involved at the board level and have frequent contact with the senior management of our portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p>Scorpion manages approximately $120 million in equity capital, and is licensed as a Small Business Investment Company by the United States Small Business Administration.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[74,90],"assets/images/resized/0005/8541/58541v1-max-150x150.png"],[[74,90],"assets/images/resized/0005/8541/58541v1-max-250x250.png"],[[74,90],"assets/images/resized/0005/8541/58541v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"245 Fifth Avenue","address2":"25th Floor","zip_code":"10016","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.7445267,"longitude":-73.9873826}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Rivulet-Communications-Raises-bw-14449454.html","source_description":"Rivulet Communications Raises $11.5 M in Series C Funding","raised_amount":11500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"Rivulet Communications","permalink":"rivulet-communications","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/6888/36888v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,42],"assets/images/resized/0003/6888/36888v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,42],"assets/images/resized/0003/6888/36888v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
