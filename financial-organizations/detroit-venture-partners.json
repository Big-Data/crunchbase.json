We back seed and early-stage technology companies who have a purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Our purpose is to help rebuild the Detroit area through entrepreneurial fire.  We view business building as a palate for creative expression and an opportunity to make a difference and change the world.  If not, why bother?</p>\n\n<p>We are creative business builders, not money managers.  We are entrepreneurs helping other entrepreneurs build and grow meaningful companies. </p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about the idea or the industry.  To us, it&#8217;s about backing passionate entrepreneurs that can both dream and execute. Great thinking trumps fancy diplomas. Imagination beats pedigree.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for investment opportunities in these sectors: internet, digital media, marketing technology, direct-to-consumer, sports &amp; entertainment, social media, e-commerce, software.  Your biotech or advanced manufacturing idea may be groundbreaking, but that&#8217;s not our focus.
