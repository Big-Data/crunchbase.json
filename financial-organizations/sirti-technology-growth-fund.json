Through a collaboration of business, higher education and government, Sirti fosters an environment where entrepreneurs and small start-up companies can flourish and high-growth companies can focus on their efficient growth.</p>\n\n<p>Sirtiâ€™s roots are in the transformative thinking that changed the regionâ€™s business climate from one that was natural resource driven to one that is now technology-based. Today our regionâ€™s community leaders and stakeholders enthusiastically embrace and promote this evolution in regional economic goals and achievements. This spirit of cooperation between government and civic organizations, colleges and universities, and leading technology-based businesses results in a creative business environment where Sirti clients learn from experts, contribute innovative ideas, and with hard work, inspired coaching and collective support, grow and prosper.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/6299/76299v1-max-150x150.png"],[[238,96],"assets/images/resized/0007/6299/76299v1-max-250x250.png"],[[238,96],"assets/images/resized/0007/6299/76299v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"665 North Riverpoint Boulevard","address2":"","zip_code":"99202-1665","city":"Spokane","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Severs","permalink":"jeff-severs","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Director","person":{"first_name":"Kim","last_name":"Zentz","permalink":"kim-zentz","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sirti.org/Home/NewsandEvents/PacinianIncReceivesInfusionofCapital/tabid/126/Default.aspx","source_description":"Pacinian Inc.
