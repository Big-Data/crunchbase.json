Currently The Galleon Group manages five different long/short equity funds: Technology, Healthcare, New Media (Internet), Communications and Life Sciences. The partners of Galleon have significant experience in the technology and health care sectors and, prior to joining Galleon, were senior professionals at Wall Street firms such as Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, Needham &amp; Company and ING Barings. Galleonâ€™s philosophy and approach differs from that of other hedge funds in the fundamental belief that it is possible to deliver superior returns to their investors without employing leverage. Galleon has built an organization where stock picking on both the long and short sides, rather than market timing, is the key to their success.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/8619/28619v1-max-150x150.png"],[[219,142],"assets/images/resized/0002/8619/28619v1-max-250x250.png"],[[219,142],"assets/images/resized/0002/8619/28619v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"590 Madison Avenue","address2":"34th Floor","zip_code":"10022 ","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.762251,"longitude":-73.9723688}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman, Galleon International","person":{"first_name":"Rajat","last_name":"Gupta","permalink":"rajat-gupta-4","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-mobile-video-tech-provider-dilithium-networks-gets-33-million-fourth-ro/","source_description":"Mobile Video Tech Provider Dilithium Networks Gets $33 Million Fourth Round Funding","raised_amount":33000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Dilithium Networks","permalink":"dilithium-networks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/8380/18380v1-max-150x150.png"],[[178,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/8380/18380v1-max-250x250.png"],[[178,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/8380/18380v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/23/altierre-raises-8-million-more-on-top-of-previous-round/","source_description":"Altierre raises $8 million more on top of previous round","raised_amount":8000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Altierre","permalink":"altierre","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/1380/31380v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,106],"assets/images/resized/0003/1380/31380v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,114],"assets/images/resized/0003/1380/31380v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.teknovus.com/News-Events/Press-Releases/2007/Teknovus-Raises-28-Million-In-â€œOversubscribedâ€-Mezzanine-Financing-R","source_description":"Teknovus Raises 28 Million In â€œOversubscribedâ€ Mezzanine Financing Round","raised_amount":28000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"Teknovus","permalink":"teknovus","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0006/6463/66463v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/6463/66463v1-max-250x250.png"],[[275,67],"assets/images/resized/0006/6463/66463v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2009/11/16/teknovus-captures-5-6m-for-optical-ethernet-chips/","source_description":"Teknovus captures $5.6M for optical Ethernet chips","raised_amount":5600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Teknovus","permalink":"teknovus","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0006/6463/66463v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/6463/66463v1-max-250x250.png"],[[275,67],"assets/images/resized/0006/6463/66463v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":10340000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Enliven Marketing Technologies","permalink":"enliven-marketing-technologies","image":null}}}],"milestones":[{"description":"Galleon is to wind down its hedge fund due to charges of insider trading","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":10,"stoned_day":21,"source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/galleon-winding-down-all-funds-2009-10","source_text":"","source_description":"Raj Rajaratnam's Galleon Winding Down All Funds","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Galleon Group","permalink":"galleon-group"}}],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
