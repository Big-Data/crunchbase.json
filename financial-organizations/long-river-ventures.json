As entrepreneurs, Long River principals have launched and operated over a dozen companies. Collectively they have raised more than $170 million in venture capital, giving us an excellent perspective on the &#8220;sell&#8221; side of capitalizing a growing company. As investors, they have been partners in both large and small venture capital firms. They have taken the lessons learned from these experiences and created a venture firm with the structure and culture to meet the needs of companies in the early stages of their growth.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0003/2064/32064v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0003/2064/32064v1-max-250x250.png"],[[292,56],"assets/images/resized/0003/2064/32064v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"100
