The fund operates as a traditional vehicle not dissimilar from an independent VC fund and at it&#8217;s core attempts to differentiate by providing a unique product to entrepreneurs looking to partner with a corporate venture investor.  They are primarily interested in giving talented founders the unfair advantage they need to scale quickly and grow great companies and tend to focus on opportunities where the fund can bring a blend of their partnership&#8217;s value mixed with some flavor of AOL (parent company) value.  AOL Ventures generally looks to invest in Seed and Series A opportunities and is broadly interested in a variety of themes around AOL&#8217;s core - content, advertising, local, mobile and SaaS.</p>\n\n<p>The fund often co-invests with San Francisco-based <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/true-ventures\" title=\"True Ventures\">True Ventures</a> and <a
