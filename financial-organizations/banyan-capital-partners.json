We invest in and buy middle-market companies located primarily in Western Canada and the northwestern United States.</p>\n\n<p>With more than 100 years of private equity, investment banking and operating experience, we have developed a strong franchise in our geographic region. As we only invest in our local geography, our success is based on our reputation for honesty, respect and integrity. We have worked directly with more than 60 companies and served as directors on more than 60 boards. When Banyan invests in an affiliate company, each partner makes a personal investment.</p>\n\n<p>As a generalist fund, Banyan makes equity investments in and buys private and public companies across most industries. We provide full or partial liquidity to existing owners or we partner with owners wishing to grow their companies with the view of realizing on a future liquidity event. We have helped many mid-sized companies grow and become more successful. As companies grow financially and organizationally, they generally become more attractive as acquisition candidates or as public entities. We leverage our experience and relationships for the benefit of all shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>Banyan has $140 million of committed capital under management. Our investor base includes two of Canada&#8217;s largest pension funds, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, a multi-billion dollar Japanese trading company and Connor, Clark &amp; Lunn Financial Group, one of Canada&#8217;s largest independent money management firms.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0010/0341/100341v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[181,74],"assets/images/resized/0010/0341/100341v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[181,74],"assets/images/resized/0010/0341/100341v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"2150 - 1111 West Georgia Street","address2":"","zip_code":"BC V6E 4M3","city":"Vancouver","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":7220000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"Syscon Justice Systems","permalink":"syscon-justice-systems","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,101],"assets/images/resized/0008/3932/83932v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[104,101],"assets/images/resized/0008/3932/83932v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[104,101],"assets/images/resized/0008/3932/83932v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":6500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Fios","permalink":"fios","image":{"available_sizes":[[[49,19],"assets/images/resized/0010/0989/100989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[49,19],"assets/images/resized/0010/0989/100989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[49,19],"assets/images/resized/0010/0989/100989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
