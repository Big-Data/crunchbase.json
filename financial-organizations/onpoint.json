This BAA was the result of Section 8150 of Public Law 107-117, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002 which, set aside funding for a Venture Capital Initiative. OnPoint was created to meet the goal of the Venture Capital Initiative which is to develop &#8220;better collaborative ties with young, small, growth-oriented companies that take risks and push innovation.&#8221; OnPoint will invest in or otherwise assist those young, small, growth-oriented companies developing innovative technologies of interest to the U.S. Army, specifically within the technology areas of interest. The investment activity undertaken by OnPoint is expected to provide the U.S. Army greater visibility into the technical development activities of companies that deal in areas of science and technology of interest to the U.S. Army and to accelerate the transition of new, or significantly improved, technologies into the U.S. Army.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0003/0359/30359v1-max-150x150.png"],[[242,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/0359/30359v1-max-250x250.png"],[[242,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/0359/30359v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"250
