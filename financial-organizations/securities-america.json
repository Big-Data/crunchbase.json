The companyâ€™s roots date back to 1984 and the firm Financial Dynamics, an insurance marketing organization founded by Steve Wild with between 10,000 and 12,000 affiliated independent insurance agents. Financial Dynamics leaders quickly recognized the potential of offering investments via its insurance agents. To do that, Financial Dynamics created Securities America, Inc; an independent securities broker/dealer.\nSecurities America, Inc. is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and recently celebrated 25 years of Innovation, Leadership and Independence in 2009! One of the United Statesâ€™ largest and most successful independent general securities broker/dealers, Securities America offers a wide range of investment products and services to investing clients through independent financial representatives. Securities America is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC). Customer accounts are cleared through National Financial Services, LLC and Pershing, LLC.\nSecurities America, Inc. provides high-quality strategic partners for independent financial representatives. These include premier firms like National Financial Services LLC (NFS) â€“ a Fidelity Investments Company â€“ that has been our clearing partner for the execution and settlement of transactions since 1992. NFS carries the majority of customer brokerage accounts for Securities America, Inc.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004 Securities America initiated a second clearing relationship to support brokerage accounts using the Pershing clearing platform. Pershing LLC brings an alternative choice in processing facilities and makes an easier transition for accounts previously hosted at a Pershing correspondent.</p>\n\n<p>Equally powerful and equally unique, the two platforms provide registered representatives the opportunity to pick which company best meets their individual mix of business, style of doing business, and personal preferences.\nA service level agreement with BOTH of these clearing companies outlines specific service standards and obligations to be met to ensure registered representatives have the pinnacle of service, no matter which platform used.\nAll customer brokerage accounts at Securities America, Inc. are carried by National Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;NFS&#8221;), a Fidelity Investments Company, or by Pershing, LLC, (&#8220;Pershing&#8221;) a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. Investments carried by both NFS and Pershing are protected in accordance with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (&#8220;SIPC&#8221;) up to $500,000 (including cash claims limited to $100,000). An explanatory brochure is available at SIPC.org. Both companies have arranged additional protection for cash and securities to supplement its SIPC coverage. This additional coverage provided through Lloyd&#8217;s of London will protect assets up to an overall aggregate level of $1 billion for assets in custody at the clearing firm including $1.9 million cash. Neither coverage protects against a decline in the market value of securities. Securities America, Inc. also serves as the corporate agency for the distribution of insurance products. Through this agency, Securities America provides its representatives with a complete line of insurance, annuity and ancillary products. Choose from term, universal and traditional life products, as well as a full range of disability, long-term care and health coverage products.</p>\n\n<p>Products that can be transacted through the brokerage accounts include equities (both listed and OTC), options, bonds, mutual funds, unit investment trusts, and certificates of deposit.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0011/7590/117590v2-max-150x150.png"],[[171,170],"assets/images/resized/0011/7590/117590v2-max-250x250.png"],[[171,170],"assets/images/resized/0011/7590/117590v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
