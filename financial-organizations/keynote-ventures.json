Their goal is to help entrepreneurs create leading information technology companies. They principally invest in early stage businesses where new technologies play  a major role and where they have particular expertise. The portfolio company needs to have a strong management team and the potential to become a market leader.  In selecting their investments they think about technology globally but invest locally.</p>\n\n<p>They have over 40 years of cumulative experience in venture capital investing and close to 70 years of substantial operating background at senior executive levels in each of the industries within KeyNote&#8217;s investment focus. Their strategy has been and will continue to be investing primarily as a lead investor in syndications with other top tier venture capital firms. They provide entrepreneurs funding, but also a network of people and resources, locally and internationally, that provide strategic counsel and operating support for their startups. In this way their global network expands and leverages their portfolio&#8217;s reach.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/9178/29178v1-max-150x150.png"],[[132,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/9178/29178v1-max-250x250.png"],[[132,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/9178/29178v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3000
