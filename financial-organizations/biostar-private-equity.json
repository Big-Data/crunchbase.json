BioStarâ€™s first fund was formed in 2003 by Managers and Scientific Advisory Board Members that have proven track records within the medical device industry. BioStar&#8217;s second fund had its first closing in 2008. BioStarâ€™s unique marriage of world renowned clinicians with experienced venture capitalists allows BioStar to capture unique deal flow and leverage decades of scientific knowledge, clinical expertise, and patient care delivery experience to benefit its investment process.</p>\n\n<p>BioStar invests in companies where we can leverage the clinical expertise of the BioStar Team. Our key focus is in cardiovascular, orthopedic, neuroscience, and gastroenterology clinical specialties. BioStar is also interested in biomaterials and how they can be used in any type of clinical area. Often a BioStar medical venture partner or advisor will serve on the SAB of our portfolio companies. BioStar encourages this as we believe our clinical expertise can only expedite a companyâ€™s success.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0005/9898/59898v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,43],"assets/images/resized/0005/9898/59898v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[244,43],"assets/images/resized/0005/9898/59898v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"560 W.
