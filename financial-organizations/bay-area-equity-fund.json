As a DBL private equity fund, it seeks to deliver market-rate venture capital returns while enabling social and environmental improvement in the Bay Areaâ€™s LMI neighborhoods. The fund invests in rapidly growing companies that are located (or are planning to locate) in target neighborhoods and can generate high quality jobs and wealth for residents in these communities. Investments focus on rapidly growing technology, consumer products and services, and health care companies that provide benefits to residents of target neighborhoods. Since its close in June 2004, the fund has been helping its portfolio companies implement tailored DBL programs to encourage connections to the communities from their early stages.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/0342/100342v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/0342/100342v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[343,71],"assets/images/resized/0010/0342/100342v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"201 California St","address2":"Suite 1450 ","zip_code":"94111","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://xdx.com/pdf/XDx-Private-Equity-Financing_1-5-06.pdf","source_description":"XDx Completes $26.5 Million Private Equity Financing","raised_amount":26500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":5,"company":{"name":"XDx","permalink":"xdx","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0005/1083/51083v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,100],"assets/images/resized/0005/1083/51083v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,100],"assets/images/resized/0005/1083/51083v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
