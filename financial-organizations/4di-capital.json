Capeâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Nurture capital is the term that best describes 4Di Capitalâ€™s purpose and philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>We understand that in the early days of any business, support, mentoring and access to networks is just as important as seed capital.</p>\n\n<p>Using tried and tested international venture capital best practices, adapted for local use, we believe in entrepreneur-friendly finance without frills, and in working as a team with our investments to achieve their true potential.</p>\n\n<p>4Di Capital Early-Stage Technology Fund 1 targets startup investment opportunities with high growth potential at the seed- and early-stages in the mobile, enterprise software and web sectors.</p>\n\n<p>We look for founder teams with hungry passion, commitment, domain expertise and deep insights into the large market problems they wish to solve with their technology solutions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/1659/51659v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,249],"assets/images/resized/0005/1659/51659v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[249,249],"assets/images/resized/0005/1659/51659v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Head
