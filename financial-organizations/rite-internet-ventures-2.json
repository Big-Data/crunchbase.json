We involve ourselves actively in our portfolio companies and support the entrepreneurs in their work. We invest for the long-term, not for â€™quick flipsâ€™ and we look for entrepreneurs with a similar perspective. Our focus is on companies headquartered in the Nordics so we can keep our level of involvement and service high.</p>\n\n<p>Our company is formed by a combination of successful entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Together we have an extensive knowledge of the industry and of growing new ventures into first class companies. In contrast to the traditional VC model, Rite Ventures is structured as an investment company with a strong financial base through private shareholders.  This gives us the necessary degrees of freedom to invest and the ability to support our portfolio companies long-term.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0003/1866/31866v1-max-150x150.png"],[[194,74],"assets/images/resized/0003/1866/31866v1-max-250x250.png"],[[194,74],"assets/images/resized/0003/1866/31866v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Malmskillnadsgatan
