They greatly contribute to the realization of our goal to be more active in the operation of venture and incubation businesses. Of course, we never lose sight of the need to expand profits and achieve return on investment.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years have passed since the dawning of the â€œnet ageâ€ that marked the start Internet revolution, and the Internet now plays an important role as infrastructure supporting our lives and society, and in seamlessly connecting economic activities across the world. Furthermore it is giving birth to various new business ventures not only in Japan, but in numerous countries throughout Asia and other parts of the world undergoing strong economic growth. The Internet is also a highly effective instrument in the innovation of various industries and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Since founding, the ngi group has created, cultivated, discovered, supported and invested in various ventures across a wide range of business realms within Japan. Furthermore they have spawned numerous new businesses and entrepreneurs, and contributed to an expansion in the Internet business in Japan. They have played an important role as a pioneer in the â€œnet ventureâ€ business in Japan, and that their activities have played a fundamental role in the creation of a new societal infrastructure, the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>However the environment in which they operate has changed dramatically as the Internet has matured to become an integral part of everyday life. Religion, culture and other traditional values continue to profoundly influence both the economy and politics. And similarly they now find that blogs written by individuals and carried over the Internet are influencing public opinion and changing the traditional landscape of the media industry. Moreover with regards to the economy, the traditional balance of power, where the United States and the European Union were at the center of power, is changing with countries like China and India looming ever larger on the economic horizon. At the same time countries in the Pan-Pacific and Asian regions seek to create their own economic area which reflects the unique characteristics of the region.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the ngi group is approaching its tenth year of operations. In 2006 they listed our Company with the objectives of achieving continued growth and contributing to society. And they view this new â€œnet age,â€ where the economy is undergoing rapid and dramatic changes, as a tremendous opportunity for our Company to expand their business realm.</p>\n\n<p>Recently we implemented a committee based system in their management structure to act as a fundamental element in their strategy during the next growth phase of ngi group. This move is designed to leverage their core competencies of venture creation, cultivation, discovery, support and investments amassed since their founding to expand their business realm to cover other growth businesses outside of the Internet industry. They also seek to expand their business operations into regions outside of Japan in both Asia and the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>In our role as a â€œnext-generation innovator,â€ they will expand the range of businesses and industries they operate in, focus upon cultivating entrepreneurs, create innovative new business ideas.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/9685/29685v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/9685/29685v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/9685/29685v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Akasaka Office","address1":"Akasaka Twin Tower Main Building 10F,","address2":"2-17-22 Akasaka, Minato-ku,","zip_code":"107-0052","city":"Tokyo","state_code":null,"country_code":"JPN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Nakameguro Tech Center","address1":"NakaMeguro GT Tower 20F,","address2":"Kamimeguro2-1-1, Meguro-ku,","zip_code":"153-0051","city":"Tokyo","state_code":null,"country_code":"JPN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director/Founder","person":{"first_name":"Kiyoshi","last_name":"Nishikawa","permalink":"kiyoshi-nishikawa","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/9690/29690v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/9690/29690v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,117],"assets/images/resized/0002/9690/29690v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Satoshi","last_name":"Koike","permalink":"satoshi-koike","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9687/29687v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[169,177],"assets/images/resized/0002/9687/29687v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[169,177],"assets/images/resized/0002/9687/29687v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Yozo","last_name":"Kaneko","permalink":"yozo-kaneko","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9688/29688v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,179],"assets/images/resized/0002/9688/29688v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[178,179],"assets/images/resized/0002/9688/29688v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Ryo","last_name":"Sato","permalink":"ryo-sato","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0002/9689/29689v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,175],"assets/images/resized/0002/9689/29689v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,175],"assets/images/resized/0002/9689/29689v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.thedeal.com/techconfidential/vc-ratings/vc-ratings/startup-cocomment-seeks-to-mon.php","source_description":"coComment wants to monetize online conversations","raised_amount":5600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"coComment","permalink":"cocomment","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0001/5910/15910v2-max-150x150.png"],[[213,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/5910/15910v2-max-250x250.png"],[[213,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/5910/15910v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.mcn-inc.com/news_detail.php?id=18","source_description":"MCN Closes Series B Financing Round","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Mobile Content Networks","permalink":"mobile-content-networks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/7687/77687v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/7687/77687v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[134,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/7687/77687v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
