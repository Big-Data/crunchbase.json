We are Stefan Glaenzer, Eileen Burbidge and Robert Dighero.</p>\n\n<p>We have been personally involved in the largest European technology exits of the past decade, including the biggest exits of the year for 4 of the past 10 years by market value (Ricardo.de acquired by QXL, Skype purchased by Ebay, Last.fm acquired by CBS, and QXL/Tradus acquired by Naspers) â€” and want to be involved in many more.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that the critical differentiator and key asset of a successful business is the passion and ability of its founders.</p>\n\n<p>We are committed to fostering an ecosystem of technology, collaboration and executional excellence in Europe.
