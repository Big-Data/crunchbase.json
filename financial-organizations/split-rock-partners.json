They are an early-stage venture capital firm that was founded in June 2004 by the former healthcare and software investment teams of St. Paul Venture Capital (SPVC). The Split Rock team managed over $1 billion of venture capital during our tenure at SPVC, and continues to manage the SPVC healthcare and software portfolio. In May of 2008, they raised $300 million in the second Split Rock Partners fund, the successor to their inaugural $275 million fund raised in April 2005.</p>\n\n<p>The Split Rock team believes that it takes great people to translate promising ideas into compelling businesses. They are grounded in a fundamental respect for entrepreneurs and the rare combination of elements required when pioneering new markets. They start by looking for entrepreneurs with the passion, vision, and skills to build leading companies. They then work with entrepreneurs collaboratively, building partnerships based on integrity and mutual respect. The Split Rock team complements management expertise with over 80 years of venture investing and entrepreneurial management experience. They are proud of the strong relationships they have built with talented entrepreneurs and co-investors throughout their history and look forward to building on that tradition.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0003/0922/30922v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/0922/30922v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[189,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/0922/30922v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Minneapolis
