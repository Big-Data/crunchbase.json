Due to their unique structure, they have a great deal of flexibility in the types of companies and situations where they can get involved.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, they know that real transformation takes time and that itâ€™s never a straight line. They fully align their incentives with their partners and have the wherewithal and long-term commitment to see through any bumps along the way.</p>\n\n<p>They have been successfully empowering owner-managers since 1985. They have been reinvesting the same pool of money from the same group of European families (through their Artal investment vehicle) since their founding. Today they manage over $4 billion in an evergreen fund and work out of offices in New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/2708/32708v1-max-150x150.png"],[[139,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/2708/32708v1-max-250x250.png"],[[139,160],"assets/images/resized/0003/2708/32708v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"750
