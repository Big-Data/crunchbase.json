They recognize that early stage companies require more than simple capital.  They strive to provide the strategic market and product development guidance that comes from our wide range of experience in the healthcare market.</p>\n\n<p>Their preference is for medical service and medical device companies.  Medical device companies must have at least one product largely through clinical trials and on the path to regulatory approval.  Service companies should have a completed service model and revenues generated from at least one market segment.  </p>\n\n<p>The initial investment ranges from $100,000 to $250,000 per company.  They typically reserve additional capital for follow-on investment as needed.  Their investment would involve placing a director on the company board.  Depending on the needs of the company, this director could provide value added input on product development, product positioning, regulatory affairs, or sales and marketing.   They are willing to lead an investment round and provide the diligence necessary to attract other larger venture investments.  Companies typically view their company as providing the capital and guidance necessary to shape their company for the necessary later rounds of venture capital for large scale growth.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0006/1149/61149v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,21],"assets/images/resized/0006/1149/61149v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,39],"assets/images/resized/0006/1149/61149v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"13707 Beechwood Point Road","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"23112","city":"Midlothian","state_code":"VA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.nilethera.com/pr090708.html","source_description":"Nile Therapeutics, Inc.
