Accelerator Ventures works with talented entrepreneurs to create the next generation of great companies. </p>\n\n<p>Accelerator Ventures brings to entrepreneurs its strong understanding of technology, capital, and venture markets. We actively help companies with financing strategy, business development, customer introductions and management team development. Our goal is to invest at the earliest stages of a company&#8217;s fund raising efforts and to leverage our domain expertise in order to help companies get on the path toward profitability. We leverage our network of angel investors, early stage funds and venture capital firms in order to meet the funding needs of our portfolio companies. </p>\n\n<p>Typically Accelerator Ventures invests in the earliest stages of a company. Investments fall into two categories:\nStartups that want to build up and prove their business before getting institutional venture capital\nStartups whose capital requirements are too small for institutional venture capital, typically raising less than $2 Million in the life of the company.\nBoth of these funding models are very startup friendly and focus on maximizing the returns for both the entrepreneur and Accelerator Ventures. </p>\n\n<p>Investments include PowerSet, Zappos, Cloudmark and Zimbio.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/1552/21552v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/1552/21552v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[191,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/1552/21552v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"PO
