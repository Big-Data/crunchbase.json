We invest in internet and mobile software startups. We fund people, even if they have no connections and little experience. This is a chance for those who want to own a business and make a difference by applying their brains, attitude and skills.\nWe help create new and exciting companies by combining a young entrepreneurâ€™s ideas and tech skills with business experience and some capital. In addition to funding and facilities, we add value by sharing our network and insight into building and operating companies. We believe this exchange maximizes the chances of success for an up-and-coming venture, and reduces common mistakes that can cause serious problems or failure.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0010/3081/103081v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/3081/103081v1-max-250x250.png"],[[305,90],"assets/images/resized/0010/3081/103081v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"2E03-05, Building 5, 925 Bonifacio High Street ","address2":"","zip_code":"1634 ","city":"Taguig","state_code":null,"country_code":"PHL","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"Insync","permalink":"insync-3","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0009/0952/90952v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/0952/90952v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0009/0952/90952v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
