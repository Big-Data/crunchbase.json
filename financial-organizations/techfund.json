As the TechFund founders experienced the quest for funding in Silicon Valley and in European tech centers, it was clear that there were few venture guys who had ever really done a start-up themselves. The VC&#8217;s often seemed surprised to find out that entrepreneurs needed not only assistance in funding but some hands-on support in building a team, re-imagining a market, or leveraging an international network. It seemed like the venture guys were on one side, and the entrepreneurs on the other. They believed that this was an opportunity for re-imagining how a venture capital relationship could be built. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/4595/44595v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/4595/44595v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/4595/44595v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Paris (Main Office)","address1":"233, rue de la Croix Nivert","address2":"Suite 10","zip_code":"75015","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":48.8349864,"longitude":2.28983}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jean-Michel","last_name":"BARBIER","permalink":"jean-michel-barbier","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner ","person":{"first_name":"Alain","last_name":"BRAVO","permalink":"alain-bravo","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://eetimes.eu/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212900638","source_description":"Novaled raises Euros 8.5 million in Round C","raised_amount":11190000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"Novaled","permalink":"novaled","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/2527/42527v1-max-150x150.png"],[[177,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/2527/42527v1-max-250x250.png"],[[177,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/2527/42527v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://dealipedia.com/deal_view_investment.php?r=11827","source_description":"Miyowa receives a $8 million investment","raised_amount":7870000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Miyowa","permalink":"miyowa","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0004/4218/44218v5-max-150x150.png"],[[210,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/4218/44218v5-max-250x250.png"],[[210,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/4218/44218v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"","source_description":"Capital Report Index","raised_amount":25280000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"Solairedirect","permalink":"solairedirect","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0005/1438/51438v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0005/1438/51438v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,141],"assets/images/resized/0005/1438/51438v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"","source_description":"Capital Report Index","raised_amount":8740000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Radio Systemes Ingenierie","permalink":"radio-systemes-ingenierie","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.earlybird.com/de/unternehmen/health-tech/portfolio/bmeye.html","source_description":"Early Bird","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"BMEYE","permalink":"bmeye","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,62],"assets/images/resized/0007/4450/74450v1-max-150x150.png"],[[142,62],"assets/images/resized/0007/4450/74450v1-max-250x250.png"],[[142,62],"assets/images/resized/0007/4450/74450v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.miyowa.fr/Miyowa-announces-a-3-million-Euro-investment.-pid135.html","source_description":"Miyowa announces a 3 million Euro investment.","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":4,"company":{"name":"Miyowa","permalink":"miyowa","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0004/4218/44218v5-max-150x150.png"],[[210,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/4218/44218v5-max-250x250.png"],[[210,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/4218/44218v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
