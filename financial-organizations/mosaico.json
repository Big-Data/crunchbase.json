Itâ€™s the result of a partnership between OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo, the leading media group in Brazil, and the entrepreneurs Guilherme Pacheco, JosÃ© Guilherme Pierotti and Roberto Malta. The three entrepreneurs are pioneers in the Internet and have founded and managed some of the most successful companies in the sector in Latin America. </p>\n\n<p>Among them, are Domain Internet, one of the pioneer Internet providers in the country, sold to PSINet in 1999; Advice, an online marketing company sold in 2001 to the Lorentzen Group; and Bondfaro, a price-comparison site. In 2006, Bondfaro merged with the competitor BuscaPÃ©, which was sold to the South-African media group Naspers-MIH in one of the largest Internet transactions in Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>Presently, Mosaico has 4 companies in its portfolio: the travel search engine Mundi, leader in its segment; the game developer Gazeus, which has the biggest card-game site network in Brazil; and the price comparison site Zoom scheduled to launch in the second semester of 2011. ClickOn is the fourth, and most recent, investment. </p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Guilherme","last_name":"Pacheco","permalink":"guilherme-pacheco","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0901/120901v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/0901/120901v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[315,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/0901/120901v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Guilherme Pacheco / Mosaico (http://www.mosaicointernet.com)</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Guilherme Pierotti","permalink":"jose-guilherme-pierotti-2","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
