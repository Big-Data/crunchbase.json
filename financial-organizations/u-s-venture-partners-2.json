Since its inception in 1981, USVP has invested more than $2.4 billion in over 420 companies. Throughout, USVP&#8217;s partners have worked diligently and consistently with early-stage companies, many of which have become industry leaders.</p>\n\n<p>The USVP team consists of accomplished venture investors, former CEOs, senior executives and technology company founders that span four generations of high-technology venture investing. This engenders a perspective on business cycles, &#8220;hot&#8221; market trends, technology evolution and revolution that is not present among all early-stage investors. Together, they have more than 300 years of operating experience and nearly 200 years of investment expertise. Founding partner Bill Bowes, who has 50 years of venture investment experience, was also the founder of Amgen, a $70 billion pharmaceutical company.</p>\n\n<p>Their investment interests include components, software, systems, services, and life sciences. Areas of current focus include semiconductors, software as a service, networking solutions for storage, wireless data, the Internet version 2.0, biomedical devices and new drugs with profound social benefits.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-150x150.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-250x250.png"],[[95,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/6983/46983v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"U.S. Venture Partners","address1":"2735 Sand Hill Road","address2":"","zip_code":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.4203572,"longitude":-122.2101847}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Bowes","permalink":"bill-bowes","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/6984/46984v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/6984/46984v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/6984/46984v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Irwin","last_name":"Federman","permalink":"irwin-federman","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/6985/46985v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/6985/46985v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/6985/46985v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/07/06/right90-web-based-sales-forecastig-company-raises-12m-more/","source_description":" Right90, Web-based sales forecasting company, raises $12M more","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":29,"company":{"name":"Right90","permalink":"right90","image":{"available_sizes":[[[137,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/2675/32675v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[137,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/2675/32675v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[137,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/2675/32675v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/04/wow_kleer_gets.html;jsessionid=WFWA12XO1ODP0QSNDLRSKHSCJUNN2JVN","source_description":"Wow!
