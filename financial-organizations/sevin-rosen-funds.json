The Sevin Rosen team, all seasoned high-tech executives, always takes a very active and team-oriented approach to helping entrepreneurs throughout every stage of the company-building process.</p>\n\n<p>Sevin Rosen Funds examine technology trends, identifying those technologies they believe will transform entire industries. Their emphasis is on what will happen next, what will succeed, and then, what will endure.</p>\n\n<p>Sevin Rosen Funds mean what they say. In the venture capital world &#8211; a world based almost entirely on personal relationships &#8211; their word and their good name are their most valuable assets. And in all their relationships, they &#8216;ve consistently placed a premium on honesty and fairness.
