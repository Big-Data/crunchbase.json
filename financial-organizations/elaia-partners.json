They are committed to taking a very active role in our investee companies, helping them benefit from their broad technology know-how.</p>\n\n<p>Elaia Partners currently manages â‚¬70 million mainly through Elaia Ventures, a French FCPR fund of â‚¬45 million backed by a diverse range of LPs â€“ financial institutions, industrials and family offices. In addition to this fundâ€™s commitments, Elaia Partners has managed â‚¬20 million through funds delegated by 123Venture and has also concluded a co-investment agreement with Neotec, which has already led to a â‚¬5 million delegation mandate.</p>\n\n<p>They typically invest between â‚¬1 and â‚¬4 million, alone or through syndicated rounds, allocating some additional financing to the future financing needs of the company. They invest mainly in France. Nevertheless, they have a specific interest in Spain where they have already invested twice, and they have an opportunistic approach in European
