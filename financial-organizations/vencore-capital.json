Since 2003, Vencore Capital has provided over $125 million in venture debt capital to more than 200 angel- and VC-backed companies. Approximately 70% of the companyâ€™s clients are start-ups backed by founders and angel investors, while the balance are later-stage companies backed by venture capital firms.</p>\n\n<p>Vencore Capital provides clients with rapid access to capital to support strategic growth initiatives, including critical capital equipment purchases, product development, and go-to-market strategies. By leveraging funds from Vencore, companies can extend their operating cash runway, achieve key milestones, move closer to breakeven/profitability, increase company valuation, and minimize shareholder dilution.</p>\n\n<p>Vencore Capital is unique among venture debt financing firms because of its focus on providing funds earlier in a companyâ€™s growth cycle and its willingness to do smaller deals ($75,000 to $2,000,000) with more flexible structures and pricing tailored to each clientâ€™s specific needs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/7673/17673v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7673/17673v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0001/7673/17673v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"So.
