Historically early stage investing in Louisiana has been done by high net worth individuals but it is sporadic, not well organized and does not provide sufficient capital or resources to early stage companies. Out of state venture funds and Louisiana CAPCOâ€™s provide large pools of capital to late stage companies requiring large equity and debt financing. As a result of this gap in financing, early stage high technology companies either do not get started, struggle for financing or move out of Louisiana.</p>\n\n<p>Targeted investments, are companies developing commercially promising technologies with an emphasis on those originating in Louisiana Universities, Louisiana companies and companies relocating to Louisiana. The companies will be in life sciences, including: pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, agritechnology, information technology and other high technology opportunities that offer venture capital returns.</p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=138393","source_description":"Advantage Capital Invests in Louisiana's Portico Learning Solutions","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Portico Learning Solutions","permalink":"portico-learning-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0003/8167/38167v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0003/8167/38167v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,87],"assets/images/resized/0003/8167/38167v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=PR&Date=20110601&ID=13713866&topic=TOPIC_FINANCING&isub=1","source_description":"Esperance Pharmaceuticals Completes $7.5 Million Series B Financing","raised_amount":7500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Esperance Pharmaceuticals","permalink":"esperance-pharmaceuticals","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0013/7401/137401v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/7401/137401v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[419,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/7401/137401v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/embera-neurotherapeutics-raises-4-5m-series-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Embera NeuroTherapeutics Raises $4.5M in Series A Financing","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Embera NeuroTherapeutics","permalink":"embera-neurotherapeutics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0014/9520/149520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[165,118],"assets/images/resized/0014/9520/149520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[165,118],"assets/images/resized/0014/9520/149520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
