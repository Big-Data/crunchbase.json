STS was established in 2003 by a group of successful entrepreneurs, former CEOs and executives whose experience proved to them that the mid market was poorly served by mainstream investment banks. </p>\n\n<p>STS is experienced in a broad range of industries. We bring added value to mid-market management, investors and owners who are seeking business advice and investment banking services tailored to that advice. In addition to strategic operating advice and tailored financial products, the STS international network also opens up to mid-market companies much larger potential markets for acquisitions or divestitures. In the case of acquisitions, this results in a greater range of targets and potential fit. In the case of divestitures, it usually means larger, more competitive auctions and greater sale price multiples. </p>\n\n<p>This structure allows STS to think locally to understand smaller companies and their specific operating environment, but to act globally, providing a window for clients into international markets and services.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0010/8443/108443v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0010/8443/108443v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,152],"assets/images/resized/0010/8443/108443v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Bridgetown","state_code":null,"country_code":"BRB","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Montreal","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Toronto","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Geneva","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHE","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"CYM","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Mexico City","state_code":null,"country_code":"MEX","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Houston","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Miami","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Nassau","state_code":null,"country_code":"BHS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San salvador","state_code":null,"country_code":"SLV","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"St-Louis","state_code":"MO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Guy","last_name":"G.
