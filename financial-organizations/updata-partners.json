They invest at the expansion phase of a company&#8217;s lifecycle in sectors where they can apply their operating experience and industry network to create value. They work closely with their portfolio companies to enhance their operational, financial and strategic decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Since the mid-90&#8217;s, the founders and partners of Updata Partners have invested in more than 60 software and software-enabled services companies serving diverse sectors with solutions for business and consumer markets.  They collaborate with management teams to strategically and tactically build businesses, leveraging deep customer, investor, strategic partner and executive talent networks throughout the IT industry. </p>\n\n<p>Updata Partners was formed in 1998 by a team of highly successful IT veterans who, in over 25 years in the industry founded and built several software firms, both VC and non-VC backed; operated large and successful public software firms as CEOs and built an industry-leading IT M&amp;A advisory firm. Updata Partners&#8217; top-tier institutional limited partners represent university endowments, pensions and foundations and experienced funds-of-funds.  The firm closed Fund IV at the end of 2007, bringing total funds under management to nearly $500 million.
