This means we like to keep up-to-date with the latest developments so we can discuss operational and strategic issues when needed - not just at board meetings. It also means that we communicate effectively amongst our team so that the person with the most appropriate skills is kept up to speed.</p>\n\n<p>Our team offers experience ranging from sales and marketing through to financing, primarily focused towards companies in the development stage. This helps us to address the most common issues.</p>\n\n<p>We invest time in our executive management relationships. We believe that open lines of communication empower management to build large &amp; valuable companies.</p>\n\n<p>We do this because we&#8217;ve been involved in development stage companies and we want to be part of creating innovative and valuable companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/3340/133340v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[194,194],"assets/images/resized/0013/3340/133340v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[194,194],"assets/images/resized/0013/3340/133340v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"13/14 Great Saint Thomas Apostle","address2":"","zip_code":"EC4V 2BB","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Douglas","permalink":"kevin-douglas","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,124],"assets/images/resized/0013/4300/134300v2-max-150x150.png"],[[99,124],"assets/images/resized/0013/4300/134300v2-max-250x250.png"],[[99,124],"assets/images/resized/0013/4300/134300v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Mitchell","last_name":"Pender","permalink":"mitchell-pender","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2381/182381v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[198,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/2381/182381v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[357,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/2381/182381v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/18/cognitive-match-secures-6-million-for-ad-targeting-technology/","source_description":"Cognitive Match Secures $6 Million For Ad Targeting Technology","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":18,"company":{"name":"Cognitive Match","permalink":"cognitive-match","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0003/9446/39446v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/9446/39446v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,129],"assets/images/resized/0003/9446/39446v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/peerindex-picks-up-3-million-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-and-beat-klout/","source_description":"PeerIndex Picks Up $3 Million To Win Friends And Influence People (And Beat Klout)","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":19,"company":{"name":"PeerIndex","permalink":"peerindex","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0008/3898/83898v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0008/3898/83898v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,133],"assets/images/resized/0008/3898/83898v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.cognitivematch.com","title":"Cognitive Match"},{"external_url":"http://www.commontime.com","title":"CommomTime"},{"external_url":"http://www.i-nexus.com","title":"i-nexus"}]}
