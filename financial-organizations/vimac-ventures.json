New business creation is essentially a collaborative enterprise where success requires continuous learning and broad-based sharing of innovative ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Based in Boston, they deploy capital in early-stage companies located in the eastern U.S. and Canada. Today, they have two separate investment teamsâ€”one focused on early stage ventures in IT/Adv.Materials technologies and the other focused on life sciences.</p>\n\n<p>To date, VIMAC investments have led to the creation of over 20 successful companies that continue to generate business innovations in IT, communications, and Internet technologies. These investments today account for over $2 billion in market value. The fund seeks to make about five new investments each year. A new investment typically goes into a Series A or Series B round with adequate reserves to support subsequent funding until the company exits via a trade sale or an IPO. Over its lifetime, a company is likely to receive $5 million to $15 million from the fund. The life sciences team makes investments from the VIMAC Milestone Medica in early stage biotechnology and medical device companies.</p>\n\n<p>They lead or co-lead most investments and their managers play a very active role on portfolio companiesâ€™ Boards of Directors. Often, they invest in a company&#8217;s first institutional round of funding and maintain support throughout the companyâ€™s lifecycle. Along the way, they maintain a close working relationship with the management team, helping them refine business plan, build go-to-market strategies, enhance capital efficiency, find early customers and partners, and grow the business.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9837/29837v1-max-150x150.png"],[[155,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/9837/29837v1-max-250x250.png"],[[155,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/9837/29837v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"177 Milk St","address2":"","zip_code":"02109-3410","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.358367,"longitude":-71.052544}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"C.
