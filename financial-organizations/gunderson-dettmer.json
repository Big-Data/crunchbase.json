Building upon the idea that â€œbest of breedâ€ wins, they are a different sort of law firmâ€”a business law firm consisting solely of business lawyers. The primary focus of the firm is to assist their clients in solving business problems, executing business strategies and achieving critical business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>With over 100 lawyers in four officesâ€“Silicon Valley, Boston, New York, and San Diegoâ€”they represent companies in every stage of developmentâ€”from startup through entry into public equity markets and beyond. Their expertise includes general corporate and securities matters, mergers and acquisitions, venture capital and private equity fund formation, representation of venture capital and private equity investors, representation of investment bankers, intellectual property and strategic alliances, cross-border transactions, tax, executive compensation, and labor and employment.</p>\n\n<p>Their business is a people business. They are committed to attracting and retaining the very best legal talent available. Their commitment to recruiting and developing extraordinary legal talent is borne out by the firmâ€™s consistent top-ten rankings in The American Lawyerâ€™s annual Summer Associate Survey.</p>\n\n<p>The firmâ€™s structure and internal systems, including the firmâ€™s partner compensation system, have been intentionally designed to enable us to work together in extremely focused and effective client and transactional teams. Every law firm claims to deliver incredibly cost-effective advice of unequalled brilliance. They believe the success of their clients (including over 100 of the worldâ€™s leading venture capital and private equity firms, over 500 private and public companies and many of the worldâ€™s leading investment banks) speaks for itself. The hallmark of their firm is the caliber of their people, their clients and their client service. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,16],"assets/images/resized/0002/8732/28732v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/8732/28732v1-max-250x250.png"],[[259,28],"assets/images/resized/0002/8732/28732v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"155 Constitution Drive","address2":"","zip_code":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.484924,"longitude":-122.175074},{"description":"","address1":"610 Lincoln Street ","address2":"","zip_code":"02451","city":"Waltham","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.405235,"longitude":-71.25311},{"description":"","address1":"220 West 42nd Street","address2":"21st Floor ","zip_code":"10036","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.756414,"longitude":-73.987825},{"description":"","address1":"11682 El Camino Real","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"92130","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":32.928998,"longitude":-117.238606}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":4100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"fabrik","permalink":"fabrik","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/3154/3154v1-max-150x150.png"],[[104,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/3154/3154v1-max-250x250.png"],[[104,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/3154/3154v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/03/factual-1-million-seed/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Factual","permalink":"factual","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0006/2569/62569v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/2569/62569v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,118],"assets/images/resized/0006/2569/62569v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://waytooearly.firstround.com","source_description":"First Round Announcement","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":29,"company":{"name":"SinglePlatform","permalink":"singleplatform","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0009/2229/92229v3-max-150x150.png"],[[207,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/2229/92229v3-max-250x250.png"],[[207,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/2229/92229v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
