Pravin Gandhi and Bharati Jacob came from Infinity Venture, the fund behind  Indiabulls,  Indiagames and the like. Mahesh Murthy came from Passionfund, where he backed Geodesic, Pinstorm and other successes. </p>\n\n<p>Then the fund size - From their experience, they figured the right amount of funding for an Indian startup wasnâ€™t in the millions or in tens of millions of dollars range. It was closer to about $500,000. They also figured they could work closely with about 15 or 20 companies over the next 5 years â€“ and hence arrived at a fund size of about $15 million. They can therefore invest from Rs. 1 to 5 crores in a startup company. That probably makes us Indiaâ€™s smallest VC fund â€“ but, hey, small can be beautiful. </p>\n\n<p>Next, the target sectors - They decided to stick close to businesses they know â€“ and sectors that can make a big difference, not just in the global market â€“ but in the large Indian market too. So theyâ€™re looking mostly at internet or media or mobile or telecom or retail or consumer-facing plays â€“ and also for things that arenâ€™t yet â€œsectorsâ€. </p>\n\n<p>On to the investors - In this market, money is cheap â€“ but the right money makes the difference. They wanted limited partners that could add significant strategic value to their startups â€“ and theyâ€™ve been lucky enough to end up with a dream team here too: institutions like Motorola Ventures, Reliance ADA Group, SVB Financial Group, an affiliate of Silicon Valley Bank, Sierra Ventures, Mayfield Fund, Edelweiss Capital â€“ and individuals like Kanwal Rekhi, KB Chandrashekhar, B V Jagadeesh and Sridar Iyengar. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/0214/30214v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[126,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/0214/30214v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[126,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/0214/30214v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Mumbai Office","address1":"001, Turf Estate, Shakti Mills Lane,","address2":"Off.
