The Fund co-invests between $50,000 and $250,000 in Seed and Series A rounds alongside established early stage venture firms (MESA+ never leads a financing). MESA+ concentrates on the New York digital media market but is able to invest in companies headquartered in other cities across the country and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>MESA+ supports talented entrepreneurs building big businesses. To do that, they invest social capital that the Fund believes is as valuable as its investment capital. This comes from tapping into the teamâ€™s global network of media, entertainment and technology relationships to provide investor introductions, executive team hiring, business development, client &amp; advertiser introductions, and marketing support. The Fund&#8217;s goal is to help its portfolio companies whenever and wherever it can.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0020/6612/206612v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,74],"assets/images/resized/0020/6612/206612v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,74],"assets/images/resized/0020/6612/206612v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"New York","address1":"85 Fifth Avenue","address2":"Sixth Floor","zip_code":"10003","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Montgomery","permalink":"andrew-montgomery","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Brody","permalink":"jacob-brody","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Patricof","permalink":"mark-patricof","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://allthingsd.com/20121029/pickie-raises-1-million-as-app-catalog-trend-kicks-into-high-gear/","source_description":"Pickie Raises $1 Million as App Catalog Trend Kicks Into High Gear","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":29,"company":{"name":"Pickie","permalink":"pickie","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":2500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Bread","permalink":"bread-labs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0010/9634/109634v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/9634/109634v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0010/9634/109634v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[{"name":"Seed fund","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":18,"raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/mesa-early-stage-funds/","source_description":"Investment Bank MESA Raises $10M Fund For Early-Stage Deals"}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
