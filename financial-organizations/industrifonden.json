The fund&#8217;s focus is on creating value in its portfolio companies. All investments are made on commercial terms together with entrepreneurs and co-investors.</p>\n\n<p>The fund plays an active role in building value in its portfolio companies and takes a long-term approach as an investor, lender or guarantor. This long-term focus is possible thanks to the  evergreen structure of the fund and its strong capital base.</p>\n\n<p>Industrifonden invests directly in companies as well as through a network of regional venture capital firms. The fund routinely invests together with other investors.\nIndustrifonden makes two types of investments in small and medium-sized companies: development capital for innovative tech startups and expansion capital for established companies that want to grow.</p>\n\n<p>Industrifonden is an independent foundation founded by the Swedish state in 1979. It operates on a commercial basis without outside capital. Revenues are returned to the business for new investments. Industrifonden&#8217;s board of directors, which is appointed by the government, is responsible for the fund&#8217;s operations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0003/2833/32833v1-max-150x150.png"],[[241,44],"assets/images/resized/0003/2833/32833v1-max-250x250.png"],[[241,44],"assets/images/resized/0003/2833/32833v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"SWE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.industrifonden.se/in_english/news/archive/industrifonden-and-eqvitec-fund-invest-sek-40-million.asp","source_description":"Industrifonden
