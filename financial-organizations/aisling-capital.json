The completion of the human genome has given scientists new insights into the causes of human disease. These insights, combined with the past 20 years of developments in the biotechnology industry, are leading to rapid expansion of novel approaches toward the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of life-threatening illnesses. These advances have led to an ever-increasing demand for capital to complete the development and commercialization of new therapeutics. Our goal is to support the leading global healthcare companies that are building on these technical and medical breakthroughs to commercialize new healthcare products.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/6625/46625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[159,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/6625/46625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[159,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/6625/46625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"888
