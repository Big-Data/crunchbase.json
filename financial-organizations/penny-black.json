What the Penny Black did for communication in the 19th century, we strive to replicate by investing in game-changing companies that improve the way people share ideas and utilize knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>With a young team at the helm, weâ€™re not your traditional VC firm.  We sit in the trenches with our CEOs, and work all hours to provide them with an unfair advantage as they grow and build markets.  We invest early, and stay actively involved in the development and growth of each company.</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™ve invested in a broad array of industries, from medical tech, to big data, to crowd-funding, paying particular attention to companies that solve real-world problems, and that produce products &amp; services that we would use.  Our most recent seed fund, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/boldstart-ventures\" title=\"BOLDstart Ventures\">BOLDstart Ventures</a>, is aimed at web-based startups in the social/mobile/media realms.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0008/8684/88684v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0008/8684/88684v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,149],"assets/images/resized/0008/8684/88684v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"London Office","address1":"42 Berkeley Square","address2":"","zip_code":"W1J 5AW","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"New York Office","address1":"900 Third Ave","address2":"25th Floor","zip_code":"10022","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Wohlstadter","permalink":"justin-wohlstadter","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5645/95645v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[163,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5645/95645v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[294,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/5645/95645v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Eliot","last_name":"Durbin","permalink":"eliot-durbin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5760/95760v2-max-150x150.png"],[[177,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5760/95760v2-max-250x250.png"],[[204,287],"assets/images/resized/0009/5760/95760v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/numberfire-raising-seed-round-to-build-the-last-fantasy-football-tool-youll-ever-need/","source_description":"NumberFire Raising Seed Round To Build The Last Fantasy Football Tool Youâ€™ll Ever Need","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"numberFire","permalink":"numberfire","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,38],"assets/images/resized/0008/5809/85809v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[119,38],"assets/images/resized/0008/5809/85809v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[119,38],"assets/images/resized/0008/5809/85809v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/la-based-startup-accelerator-amplify-launches-4-5m-fund-with-backing-from-mark-burnett-brian-grazer-eric-schmidt/","source_description":"LA-Based Startup Accelerator Amplify Launches $4.5M Fund With Backing From Mark Burnett, Brian Grazer, Eric Schmidt","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Amplify.LA","permalink":"amplify-la","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0016/6491/166491v1-max-150x150.png"],[[198,83],"assets/images/resized/0016/6491/166491v1-max-250x250.png"],[[198,83],"assets/images/resized/0016/6491/166491v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/12/roqbot-seed-raise/","source_description":"Roqbot Raises $1.2M From Google Ventures & More To Turn Your Smartphone Into A Social Jukebox","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"Roqbot","permalink":"roqbot","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0012/1830/121830v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/1830/121830v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0012/1830/121830v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[{"description":"Invested in Hashable","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":22,"source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/hashable-2010-11","source_text":null,"source_description":"Hot New York Startup Hashable Raises $4 Million At $25-$30 Million Valuation  Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/hashable-2010-11#ixzz1AUoVylZe","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Penny Black","permalink":"penny-black"}},{"description":"Invested in Klout","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":10,"source_url":"http://www.observer.com/2011/media/new-york-start-investor-jumps-klouts-85-million-funding-round","source_text":null,"source_description":"New York Investors Dive Into Klout's $8.5 Million Funding Round","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Penny Black","permalink":"penny-black"}}],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.pennyblack.vc","title":"Homepage"}]}
