Since its inception in 1981, USVP has invested more than $2.4 billion in over 420 companies. Throughout, USVP&#8217;s partners have worked diligently and consistently with early-stage companies, many of which have become industry leaders.</p>\n\n<p>The USVP team consists of accomplished venture investors, former CEOs, senior executives and technology company founders that span four generations of high-technology venture investing. This engenders a perspective on business cycles, &#8220;hot&#8221; market trends, technology evolution and revolution that is not present among all early-stage investors. Together, they have more than 300 years of operating experience and nearly 200 years of investment expertise. Founding partner Bill Bowes, who has 50 years of venture investment experience, was also the founder of Amgen, a $70 billion pharmaceutical company.</p>\n\n<p>Their investment interests include components, software, systems, services, and life sciences. Areas of current focus include semiconductors, software as a service, networking solutions for storage, wireless data, the Internet version 2.0, biomedical devices and new drugs with profound social benefits.</p>\n\n<p>They invest at a steady pace even during periods when technology investing is out of favor. They do so because they take a long view and expect most of their companies to take five years or more to become established and self-sustaining. The immediate economic environment at a company&#8217;s beginning is not particularly relevant to its ultimate success or value. This approach resulted in 22 new deals in 2005, for example, 15 of which were first-round investments. USVP invested in a similar number of start-ups in 2006 (14) and 2007 (13). Since 1981, USVP has invested more than $2.4 billion in over 420 companies. Seventy-four companies achieved IPO as of the end of 2007. Many others have realized positive merger outcomes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/5080/15080v1-max-150x150.png"],[[103,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/5080/15080v1-max-250x250.png"],[[103,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/5080/15080v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2735
