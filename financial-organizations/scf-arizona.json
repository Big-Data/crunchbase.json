The Arizona Legislature provided seed money for SCF, which was paid back by 1938. Since that time, SCF Arizona has been funded entirely by policyholders&#8217; premiums and by investments. SCF receives no state funds and is not tax supported.</p>\n\n<p>In 1969, the Arizona Legislature separated SCF from the Industrial Commission, allowing SCF to begin operating as a private business. The Legislature continued to cut ties with SCF in 1983, when it exempted the company from following state procurement rules under Title 35.</p>\n\n<p>In 1990, a further separation occurred, when the Legislature removed SCF from the state personnel and state risk management systems. And in 2004, a Maricopa County Superior Court Judge ruled that SCFâ€™s fiduciary duty is to its policyholders and not to the State of Arizona.</p>\n\n<p>SCF is fully competitive and operates under the same rules, rate structure and regulations as all private insurance companies providing workersâ€™ compensation insurance in Arizona.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, SCF Arizona launched SCF Premier Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary that gives the company more flexibility in premium rates for SCFâ€™s largest and safest companies.</p>\n\n<p>Through all the changes, SCFâ€™s vision and mission remain focused on quality customer service to all policyholders and on providing unsurpassed excellence in workersâ€™ compensation.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/9915/29915v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/9915/29915v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,181],"assets/images/resized/0002/9915/29915v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Marketing and Communications","person":{"first_name":"Phyllis","last_name":"Senseman","permalink":"christa-severns","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior PR/Communications Specialist ","person":{"first_name":"Bruce","last_name":"Christian Trethewy","permalink":"bruce-christian-trethewy","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.flypaper.com/_objects/editor/documents/Flypaper%20Series%20A%20Funding%20FINAL%20Feb%206.htm","source_description":"","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Flypaper","permalink":"flypaper","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/2395/12395v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[192,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/2395/12395v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[192,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/2395/12395v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/05/flypaper-raises-35-million-for-interactive-presentations/","source_description":"Flypaper Raises $3.5 Million For Interactive Presentations","raised_amount":3500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":5,"company":{"name":"Flypaper","permalink":"flypaper","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/2395/12395v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[192,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/2395/12395v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[192,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/2395/12395v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
