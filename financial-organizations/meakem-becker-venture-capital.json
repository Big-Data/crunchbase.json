Glen was co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of FreeMarkets, formerly the leading provider of internet deployed software and services for automating the sourcing processes of Global 1000 companies. Dave was FreeMarketsâ€™ President and COO. After successfully launching, managing the explosive growth, record breaking IPO, and final sale of FreeMarkets, Glen and Dave founded Meakem Becker Venture Capital to help other entrepreneurs build leading companies.</p>\n\n<p>Meakem Becker follows a disciplined investment strategy to make early-stage venture investments. We invest in great people with compelling products or services that target large markets. We use our deep experience as well as networks of former employees, customers, service providers, advisors, and investors to help entrepreneurs build and scale their businesses, creating tomorrowâ€™s market leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Our core investing team works together from our office in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh. Because of our location, we have a particular focus on investing in companies in the Eastern and Midwestern United States. However, we also invest outside of this region when we find attractive opportunities that are particularly well matched with our experience and expertise.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0001/8151/18151v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/8151/18151v1-max-250x250.png"],[[333,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/8151/18151v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"603 Beaver Street","address2":"","zip_code":"15143","city":"Sewickley","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.538956,"longitude":-80.17913}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Glen","last_name":"Meakem","permalink":"glen-meakem","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Koegler","permalink":"david-koegler","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Director","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"G.
