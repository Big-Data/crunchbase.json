The first investment fund, Open Prairie Ventures I, L.P. (OPV I), was formerly licensed by the Small Business Administration as a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC).  In 2006, JIm Schultz, Michael Peck, and Dennis Beard recapitalized the SBA&#8217;s Limited Partner interest in OPV I through a buyout of the SBA position.  OPV I completed fifteen investments with four successful exits, including the 2007 IPO of TomoTherapy (NASDAQ: TOMO) and has four active portfolio investments remaining. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0010/2911/102911v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0010/2911/102911v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[331,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/2911/102911v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"400 East Jefferson ","address2":"","zip_code":"62401","city":"Effingham","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"e","source_url":"http://www.infoblox.com/news/release.cfm?ID=39","source_description":"Infoblox Secures $30 Million To Continue Rapid Growth","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"Infoblox","permalink":"infoblox","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0009/5962/95962v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,44],"assets/images/resized/0009/5962/95962v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[395,71],"assets/images/resized/0009/5962/95962v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/11/privia-raises-capital.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Privia Raises Capital","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Privia","permalink":"privia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,53],"assets/images/resized/0016/3647/163647v1-max-150x150.png"],[[119,53],"assets/images/resized/0016/3647/163647v1-max-250x250.png"],[[119,53],"assets/images/resized/0016/3647/163647v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://pevc.dowjones.com/article?an=DJFVW00020120508e858qry3h&from=alert&pid=32&ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fpevc.dowjones.com%3a80%2farticle%3fan%3dDJFVW00020120508e858qry3h%26from%3dalert%26pid%3d32","source_description":"Vestaron Lures New Investors To $10.2M Series B For Spider-Venom Insecticides ","raised_amount":10200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Vestaron Corporation","permalink":"vestaron-corporation","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0015/3183/153183v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0015/3183/153183v1-max-250x250.png"],[[326,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/3183/153183v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[{"name":"Second Midwest Venture Fund","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":22,"raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","source_url":"https://www.fis.dowjones.com/article.aspx?ProductIDFromApplication=29&aid=DJFVLS0020101022e6am00002&r=Rss&s=DJFVLS","source_description":"Open Prairie Reaches $30M For Second Midwest Venture Fund "}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
