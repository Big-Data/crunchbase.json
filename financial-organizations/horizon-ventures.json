We search for entrepreneurs with a vision that is both compelling and pragmatic and who appreciate active involvement as much as equity financing. We believe differentiated technology provides the best platform from which to build a profitable and sustainable company.</p>\n\n<p>Horizon Ventures invests in technology startups with an emphasis in the following areas:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Communications and Systems\n* Component Technologies\n* Healthcare IT\n* Software Applications for Business\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Horizon Ventures was founded in 1999, and manages $150 million in private and SBIC leveraged capital. We make investments in institutional rounds with similar firms who will add value and are local to the company. Our companies usually have some institutional VC investment already and are either entering their market or generating revenue of $1 to $5 million per year. We prefer to make a $2 to $4 million initial investment and target a total investment of $7 million or more over time; however, we will consider smaller initial investments in selected situations. We invest predominantly in the San Francisco Bay Area, with consideration given to investments west of the Rocky Mountains where we can visit the company easily and often.</p>\n\n<p>We like to actively assist entrepreneurs achieve their objectives and work closely with them to determine optimal exit outcomes. Horizon Ventures offers the benefit of 100 man-years of operating experience and more than 40 man-years making early stage venture capital investments. Our &#8220;back to basics&#8221; approach provides portfolio companies with the opportunities for profitable growth achieved by following sound business fundamentals.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,142],"assets/images/resized/0005/0941/50941v1-max-150x150.png"],[[134,142],"assets/images/resized/0005/0941/50941v1-max-250x250.png"],[[134,142],"assets/images/resized/0005/0941/50941v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"4
