With 64 funds across four investment disciplines (buyouts, growth capital, real estate and leveraged finance), Carlyle combines global vision with local insight, relying on a top-flight team of 475+ investment professionals operating out of offices in 20 countries to uncover superior opportunities in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America.</p>\n\n<p>While open to opportunities wherever they can be found, Carlyle focuses on sectors in which it has demonstrated expertise: aerospace &amp; defense, automotive &amp; transportation, consumer &amp; retail, energy &amp; power, financial services, healthcare, industrial, infrastructure, real estate, technology &amp; business services and telecommunications &amp; media.</p>\n\n<p>In a world awash with information, insight is often in short supply.
