They understand the many challenges in building a successful business because they have done it many times themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Their clientsâ€™ vision becomes a reality because they are the strategic catalyst and provide a broad range of intelligence and support. They know that their real work only begins on the day they make an investment. They pride themselves in their ability to work closely with their portfolio management partners and they bring the same passion, emotion and energy that they have for their own business. They also leave nothing to chance, they understand and carefully manage all potential risks.</p>\n\n<p>In every deal they do, they bring their business acumen and balanced judgment, their entrepreneurial expertise, their pipeline of senior network contacts, access to unlimited critical enterprise information and finally, an unbridled commitment for success.\nTheir goal is to always be fundamentally involved with every company they support so that it can properly benefit from their extensive strategic, financial, and operational expertise. They have been able to nurture and foster long term relationships because they are fair, open, transparent, and highly ethical professionals. They make their integrity work for them. They are careful to ensure that everyoneâ€™s economic interests, responsibilities, goals and objectives are fully aligned and constantly communicated. That is why they are not just a merchant bank with capital, they are recognized by their clients as real partners.</p>\n\n<p>Their greatest resource is their people and the people that they work with. They see every investment as pure and well-planned teamwork where everyone knows where â€˜the goal line isâ€™ - that is how you build great companies. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0002/9181/29181v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9181/29181v1-max-250x250.png"],[[307,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/9181/29181v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Scotia Plaza, Suite 3200","address2":"40 King St. West","zip_code":"M5H 3Y2","city":"Toronto, Ontario","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kenneth","last_name":"J.
