The firm manages more than $3.7 billion in capital, has funded over 450 companies since inception and has demonstrated an exemplary track record producing premier investment returns during differing capital market environments. Our size, global presence and heritage enable us to offer our portfolio companies high-level, long-term assistance. Our experience makes us realistic about how businesses unfold, and we can advise our portfolio companies at all phases of growth, from start-up through IPO or acquisition.</p>\n\n<p>NVP is a global fund dedicated to both domestic and international investments. We believe that raising one global fund is a distinct advantage for our portfolio companies. In todayâ€™s global economy, it is important that all NVP portfolio companiesâ€”whether they are based in the U.S. or abroadâ€”benefit from our network of global contacts and resources. Therefore, weâ€™ve chosen to invest out of one single fund, instead of keeping our international investments and partners separate from the rest of the firm. NVP partners are committed to each investment in the portfolio, regardless of the location, and they all have a vested interest in making each NVP company successful.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0010/2879/102879v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0010/2879/102879v1-max-250x250.png"],[[260,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/2879/102879v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"525 University Ave. ","address2":"Suite 800  ","zip_code":"94301-1922  ","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Entrepreneur in Residence","person":{"first_name":"Zia","last_name":"Yusuf","permalink":"zia-yusuf","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
