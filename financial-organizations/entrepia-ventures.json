After investing, we actively support business development initiatives of our portfolio companies in Japan and other Asian markets. Leveraging Entrepiaâ€™s relationships, many of our portfolio companies benefit from distribution arrangements, joint-ventures, partnerships and alliances with Japanese companies resulting in incremental revenues as well as additional financing sources.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepiaâ€™s distinctive approach to delivering value goes well beyond making introductions to prospective customers and partners. Based on the many years of hands-on experience of its team with distribution, manufacturing and service companies in Japan, we help leverage managementâ€™s time and assemble/manage the right set of resources in Asian markets â€“ markets that are often high-growth and attractive yet difficult to efficiently access.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepiaâ€™s office in Tokyo plays a key role in our effort. On-the-ground presence of Entrepiaâ€™s well-connected and experienced staff enables portfolio companies to be positioned optimally, to work the system from the inside, to read and respond to changes rapidly and to avoid pitfalls, thereby maximizing the likelihood of success.</p>\n\n<p>Besides supporting Entrepia Venturesâ€™ portfolio companies, Entrepia Japan also invests in Japanese start-ups and seeds businesses that can take advantage of Entrepiaâ€™s cross-border operations.â€ (See case study for
