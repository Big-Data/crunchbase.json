The Company’s mission was to create a source of risk capital to fill the senior debt to equity funding “gap” experienced by growing companies. Their investment activity complements, rather than competes with, the financing provided by senior lenders and equity investors. Mass. Capital provides higher risk growth and acquisition capital to manufacturing, distribution, service and technology companies. They focus on emerging growth and middle market companies with operations in Massachusetts. Their investments are structured to fit the specific needs of portfolio companies and to complement funding available from senior lenders and equity investors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0020/4221/204221v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,89],"assets/images/resized/0020/4221/204221v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[175,89],"assets/images/resized/0020/4221/204221v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"420 Boylston Street","address2":"","zip_code":"02116","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/dynasil-corporation-america-secures-3-131000780.html","source_description":"Dynasil Corporation of America Secures $3 Million Financing from Massachusetts Capital Resource Company","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Dynasil","permalink":"dynasil","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0020/4210/204210v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0020/4210/204210v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[278,91],"assets/images/resized/0020/4210/204210v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
