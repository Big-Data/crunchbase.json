As of August 2011, Frontera has merged with the venture arm of Siemer &amp; Associates to form Siemer Ventures.</p>\n\n<p>As a part of Siemer Ventures, Frontera&#8217;s remaining portfolio companies continue to be on the verge of taking their product and/or service to market. These companies are between the â€œpost-angel and pre-VCâ€ funding rounds â€” typically companies that have outstripped the funding capabilities of their angel investors but are not quite ready for a conventional venture capital funding round yet.</p>\n\n<p>Frontera Capital (now Siemer Ventures) bridges this funding gap that most emerging companies experience in their early evolution. The people behind Frontera (now Siemer Ventures) are all entrepreneurs that have previously built and sold their own businesses. This track record makes these principals ideal partners for entrepreneurs in building valuable and enduring businesses.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[89,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/8297/28297v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[89,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/8297/28297v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[89,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/8297/28297v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Siemer Ventures Office","address1":"1333 2nd St., Suite 600","address2":"","zip_code":"50011","city":"Santa Monica","state_code":"CA","country_code":"ESP","latitude":34.1538216,"longitude":-118.4662511},{"description":"Siemer Ventures Office","address1":"1333 2nd St., Suite 600","address2":"","zip_code":"90401","city":"Santa Monica","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder and Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Manlunas","permalink":"eric-manlunas","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/02/opposing-views-raises-125m-to-help-you-understand-the-issues/","source_description":"Opposing Views raises $1.25M to explain complicated issues","raised_amount":1250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Opposing Views","permalink":"opposing-views","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/2676/22676v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/2676/22676v1-max-250x250.png"],[[256,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/2676/22676v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2006/10/24/mobile-content-networks-raises-6m-for-branded-search/","source_description":"Mobile Content Networks raises $6M for branded search","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"Mobile Content Networks","permalink":"mobile-content-networks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/7687/77687v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/7687/77687v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[134,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/7687/77687v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://mor.ph/news/morphlabs-completes-seriesb","source_description":"Morphlabs Completes Series B Financing","raised_amount":5500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Morphlabs","permalink":"morph-labs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/1327/41327v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0004/1327/41327v9-max-250x250.png"],[[367,92],"assets/images/resized/0004/1327/41327v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ibtimes.com/prnews/20081020/frontera-resources-retains-smh-capital-for-capital-markets-advisory-and-trading-liquidity-services-a.htm","title":"Frontera Resources Retains SMH Capital for Capital Markets Advisory and Trading Liquidity Services and as Designated Advisor for U.S. Disclosure"}]}
