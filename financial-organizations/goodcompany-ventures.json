GoodCompany entrepreneurs get a great place to work in Philadelphia, a community of like-minded entrepreneurs, and access to a network of capital sources and expert advisors. GCV champions models that offer investors both financial return and social impact. \nGoodCompany Ventures provides support, facilities, and mentoring to qualified, socially conscious entrepreneurs who can make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>The program is a pioneer in the social sector, repurposing a proven venture strategy in this emerging sector. Unlike conventional venture incubators, GoodCompany Ventures doesnâ€™t extract an equity commitment from entrepreneurs, but expects a commitment of time and creativity toward building a community of social entrepreneurship. The program will culminate in a Funding Day where companies will pitch their ideas to investors.</p>\n\n<p>Services provided to participants in the program include:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Access to Infrastructure: Conference and office space as well as technology infrastructure within our facility in The Navy Yard in Philadelphia, PA.\n* Access to Advisors: GoodCompany Ventures has assembled mentors, preferred providers, expert advisors, industry leaders, and start-up gurus.\n* Access to Capital: GoodCompany Ventures will facilitate a first investment round by assembling representatives from leading VC firms and angel investors.\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0004/0152/40152v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/0152/40152v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/0152/40152v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Administrative Offices","address1":"4700 Wissahickon Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"19144","city":"Philadelphia","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.0157532,"longitude":-75.170142}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Naeemah","last_name":"Nelson","permalink":"naeemah-nelson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"Shoshanna Loeb","permalink":"dr-shoshanna-loeb","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Gray","permalink":"jacob-gray","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Director ","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Bentley","permalink":"chris-bentley","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Sid","last_name":"Amster","permalink":"sid-amster","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Garrett","last_name":"Melby","permalink":"garrett-melby","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0007/8539/78539v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,248],"assets/images/resized/0007/8539/78539v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,447],"assets/images/resized/0007/8539/78539v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Famolari","permalink":"david-famolari","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Design & Marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Trellist","permalink":"trellist","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0007/2893/72893v2-max-150x150.png"],[[163,32],"assets/images/resized/0007/2893/72893v2-max-250x250.png"],[[163,32],"assets/images/resized/0007/2893/72893v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"title":"Legal Counsel","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Greenburg Traurig","permalink":"greenburg-traurig","image":null}}],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://greenskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/03/good-company-ventures-virtual-incubator.html","title":"The Green Skeptic"},{"external_url":"http://www.pehub.com/35832/goodcompany-ventures-launches/","title":"PE Hub"},{"external_url":"https://www.fis.dowjones.com/article.aspx?ProductIDFromApplication=32&aid=DJFVW00020090331e541000dx&r=Rss&s=DJFVW","title":"Venture Wire"},{"external_url":"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Funds_start_social-environmental_business_incubator.html?posted=y&viewAll=y","title":"Philadelphia Inquirer"}]}
