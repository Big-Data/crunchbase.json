They focus upon those companies with sustained revenue and proven gross margins. They seek growth businesses, which have achieved a balance between sustainable growth and expense control.</p>\n\n<p>Their capital is typically used to accelerate revenue growth, make acquisitions, or provide liquidity to founders and existing shareholders. They are often the lead and first institutional investor but they also participate as a member of larger syndicates with other respected investment groups. Furthermore, they are often a minority investor and their relationship with management is crucial to their success. Therefore, their objective is to create long-term partnerships with exceptional management teams who are building growth businesses and require Ticonderogaâ€™s experience, knowledge, contacts and capital to maximize their success.</p>\n\n<p>Each of their portfolio companies has access to the resources of their entire firm and they play an active advisory role in the following areas: recruiting, strategic planning, negotiating and raising capital, advising on mergers and acquisitions, and accessing strategic or corporate partners. By providing these resources, the Ticonderoga team has been able to successfully invest in outstanding companies and increase their value significantly.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/3249/33249v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0003/3249/33249v1-max-250x250.png"],[[255,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/3249/33249v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/04/04/markettools-marekting-company-raises-23m-amid-competition/","source_description":"VentureBeat","raised_amount":60000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"MarketTools","permalink":"markettools","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0003/3244/33244v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/3244/33244v1-max-250x250.png"],[[290,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/3244/33244v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.afsi.com/pressrel.asp?contentid=533","source_description":"AFS
