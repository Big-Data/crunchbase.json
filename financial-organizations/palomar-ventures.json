The founding principle of Palomar is teamwork; they work closely with their portfolio companies to assist them in achieving their objectives. The partners at Palomar have contributed their strategic insight, network of corporate relationships, and recruiting skills to assist in building nearly 50 public companies.</p>\n\n<p>Palomar Ventures is currently investing Palomar III, a $225 million fund, bringing total capital under management to over $500 million. A typical investment involves $2 million to $5 million in capital, and they prefer to act as a lead or co-lead investor early in the process of value formation. They believe that beginning early with a company is the best way to utilize their experience in building value rapidly by focusing the company on a small number of key milestones.</p>\n\n<p>Given their personal experience in running venture-backed companies, Palomar&#8217;s partners understand the frustrations of the entrepreneur in dealing with the venture community. Their philosophy includes a commitment to responding rapidly to new ideas and business plans, and to forming partnerships with the goal of creating sustainable companies for the long term.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/9521/29521v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/9521/29521v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/9521/29521v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Santa
