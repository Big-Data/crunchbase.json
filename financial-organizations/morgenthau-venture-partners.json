The Accelerator Fund will make equity investments in a diversified portfolio of growing technology driven privately held companies with $2 million to $30 million in revenues. The Fund will focus its investment activities towards those emerging technology industries including, software, IT infrastructure and consumer and business services. Based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the Accelerator Fund will pursue investments primarily in the Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas) with particular emphasis on the most underserved market, Florida. The Fund derives a significant competitive advantage from being one of the few indigenous venture capital funds located in Florida. The benefit of proximity is an absolute necessity to ensure ongoing and rigorous monitoring of the Fundâ€™s portfolio. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0007/8050/78050v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/8050/78050v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[404,61],"assets/images/resized/0007/8050/78050v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"6750 N Andrews Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"33309","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state_code":"FL","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/myxer-raises-65-million-in-series-a-1-financing-58265832.html","source_description":"Myxer Raises $6.5 Million in Series A-1 Financing","raised_amount":6500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"Myxer","permalink":"myxer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0000/0862/862v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/0862/862v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[215,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/0862/862v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
