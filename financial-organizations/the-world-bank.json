They are not a bank in the common sense. They are made up of two unique development institutions owned by 185 member countriesâ€”the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA).</p>\n\n<p>Each institution plays a different but collaborative role to advance the vision of an inclusive and sustainable globalization. The IBRD focuses on middle income and creditworthy poor countries, while IDA focuses on the poorest countries in the world. Together they provide low-interest loans, interest-free credits and grants to developing countries for a wide array of purposes that include investments in education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource management.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,16],"assets/images/resized/0003/0740/30740v1-max-150x150.png"],[[118,16],"assets/images/resized/0003/0740/30740v1-max-250x250.png"],[[118,16],"assets/images/resized/0003/0740/30740v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1818 H Street, NW","address2":"","zip_code":"20433","city":"Washington","state_code":"DC","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.898785,"longitude":-77.042087}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Kann","permalink":"patrick-kann","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5839/35839v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5839/35839v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[198,258],"assets/images/resized/0003/5839/35839v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Infrastructure Finance Think-Tank","person":{"first_name":"Inmaculada","last_name":"Martinez","permalink":"inmaculada-martinez","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8449/98449v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[186,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8449/98449v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[242,324],"assets/images/resized/0009/8449/98449v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Associate","person":{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"Belsky","permalink":"leah-belsky","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0019/7630/197630v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,177],"assets/images/resized/0019/7630/197630v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,319],"assets/images/resized/0019/7630/197630v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"Yuri","last_name":"Milner","permalink":"yuri-milner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0004/5568/45568v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0004/5568/45568v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[395,312],"assets/images/resized/0004/5568/45568v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Financial Officer","person":{"first_name":"Obi","last_name":"Ugochuku","permalink":"obi-ugochuku","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
