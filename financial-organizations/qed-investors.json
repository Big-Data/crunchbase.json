While our support is tailored to the specific needs of each portfolio company, we typically provide a combination of both capital and capability. With operationally-oriented skills that we believe are both fundamentally applicable and broadly transferable, we enjoy working closely with a small set of carefully selected companies that range in size and style. But common to all of our partnerships is a shared conviction that information plays a decisive role in the success of the company, a mutual desire for a high degree of direct engagement, and a shared enthusiasm for experimentation and learning.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0005/8564/58564v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[174,93],"assets/images/resized/0005/8564/58564v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[174,93],"assets/images/resized/0005/8564/58564v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/191872/mediamath-secures-125-million-growth-capital-financing","source_description":"MediaMath
