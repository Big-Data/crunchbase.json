CTV has built a strong reputation for its entrepreneurial approach to investing and working with companies. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike many investment funds, CTV can invest the smaller amounts required by early-stage companies, as well as larger investments for later-stage expansion. Initial investments typically range from $250,000 to $2 million, with up to $5 million over the life of the investment. CTV participates in seed/start-up companies, first and second round investments, and later stage investments.</p>\n\n<p>CTV invests primarily in companies engaged in the following industries:\nInformation &amp; Communications Technology, such as computer hardware, telecommunications, electronics, semiconductors, software and systems, multi-media, and Internet;\nLife Sciences, such as bio-pharmaceuticals and medical devices;\nWhen considering funding a company, CTV looks for:</p>\n\n<p>Experienced and capable management;\nUnique, &#8220;must-have&#8221; or proprietary
