This is purely because all but the most sophisticated organizations are overwhelmed by the massive datasets that are now commonplace. And this is just structured data. Messy unstructured data is everywhere and goes largely unexplored. Unlocking even a small amount of the information held within it will transform entire industries.</p>\n\n<p>We believe many factors, including commodity clusters, cloud platforms, and advanced statistical algorithms, are making it possible to store, manage, and extract insight from massive datasetsâ€”creating a Big Data revolution. We invest in talented early stage teams fueling this revolution with the development of innovative tools, technologies and analytics for managing and extracting value from Big Dataâ€”both structured and unstructured. We are interested in a wide variety of verticals including government, healthcare, financial services, and often our investments are directly or indirectly relevant to quantitative trading.
