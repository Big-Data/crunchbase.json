Because of these gaps, numerous companies are frequently underserved and under-recognized by the capital markets. In response, Lacuna has pioneered the Gap Capitalâ„¢ concept.</p>\n\n<p>Many entrepreneurs find that their angel funding takes them only so far. At the same time, most established venture funds are gravitating toward larger investments in later-stage companies. As a result, many worthy young companies find themselves caught in the â€œcapital gap.â€ The Lacuna Venture Fund is a new kind of venture fund focused on providing Gap Capitalâ„¢ of $500,000 to $3 million to dynamic early-stage companies that are ready to go to market, but that need the next level of financial and advisory resources to succeed.</p>\n\n<p>The Lacuna Hedge Fund invests in select small-cap and micro-cap public companies that fall into the â€œinformation gapâ€ which occurs when small companies are overlooked by Wall Street and the investing public. In addition, Lacuna offers its strategic and operational expertise to these small companies in order to help impact the way they go to market and to create significant improvement in their operating leverage.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/9332/29332v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/9332/29332v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/9332/29332v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1100 Spruce Street","address2":"Suite 202","zip_code":"80302","city":"Boulder","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.018421,"longitude":-105.281119}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.balihoo.com/FrontEnd/March282007.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Balihoo","permalink":"balihoo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,155],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://news.speeple.com/paidcontent.org/2007/07/18/balihoo-raises-1-5-million-in-first-round-funding-for-online-media-buying-search-engine.htm","source_description":"","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Balihoo","permalink":"balihoo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,155],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/01/07/balihoo-takes-4m-for-advertisers-search-engine/","source_description":"","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Balihoo","permalink":"balihoo","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,155],"assets/images/resized/0002/0719/20719v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.rockyradar.com/2009/09/16/mocapay-secures-3m-funding-round/2523","source_description":"Mocapay Secures $3M Funding Round","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Mocapay","permalink":"mocapay","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0006/0980/60980v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0006/0980/60980v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0006/0980/60980v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
