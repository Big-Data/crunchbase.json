We believe Apex gives investors a way to profit from the &#8220;China story&#8221; without taking large directional exposure. Unlike most firms in the region, Apex does not seek to simply exploit the growth in China with a substantial net-long exposure. Instead, we attempt to capitalize on short term opportunities in the region by trading in the local markets as well as through cross-border trading. Our short-term focus is designed to out-perform in both rising and declining markets.</p>\n\n<p>Upon inception, Apex set up a dual office structure and has since operated with full investment and operational teams in New York and Hong Kong. The New York and Hong Kong portfolio managers have worked together for over twenty years and thus can trade seamlessly despite the temporal and geographic differences. We also have the ability to trade twenty-four hours a day, taking advantage of cross-border opportunities through local shares as well as the ADR&#8217;s and GDR&#8217;s. Our knowledge of capital flows and access to research and brokers give us a unique pulse on the market and an ability to take advantage of special events.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0010/0233/100233v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[215,40],"assets/images/resized/0010/0233/100233v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[215,40],"assets/images/resized/0010/0233/100233v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"One Bryant Park 37th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"10036","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.acaciaresearch.com/pr/021005PPM.pdf","source_description":"Acacia Technologies Group to Receive $19.6 Million","raised_amount":19600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"Acacia Research","permalink":"acacia-research","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0007/2299/72299v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0007/2299/72299v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0007/2299/72299v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
