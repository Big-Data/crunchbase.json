The group was founded in Denmark in 1969 and operates independently from the major banking institutions. BankInvest is owned by a large number of local and regional banks. None of the owners control more than 15 per cent of the equity, giving BankInvest the independence and opportunity to achieve our main goal: Excellence in asset management.</p>\n\n<p>BankInvest has steadily broadened its fields of expertise since the beginning in 1969, when the first mutual fund investing in Danish equities was launched. From the start, a hallmark of all developments has been innovation paired with respect for the obvious fact that good investment results are based on long term commitments. A constant element has been to secure that fundamental investment processes are rooted in steady and consistent principles - principles, which have remained unchanged for years.</p>\n\n<p>Today, BankInvest offers investment products ranging from global equities, over emerging market equities and debt via regular bonds to private equity and venture capital funds. Moreover, BankInvest is active in the creation of structured products and has a fast-growing business as a third party administrator of investment products offered by other asset managers.</p>\n\n<p>In tune with our Scandinavian roots, BankInvest has also launched a series of investment products based on internationally acknowledged principles for Socially Responsible Investments (SRI). For the investor requiring assurance that the portfolios are invested in companies complying with globally recognised standards for socially responsible economic activities, many of BankInvest&#8217;s core products are available in an SRI version, whose principles for exclusion of certain companies are transparent and well-documented. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0002/7576/27576v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0002/7576/27576v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0002/7576/27576v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"BI Holding A/S","address2":"Sundkrogsgade 7","zip_code":"DK-2100","city":"Copenhagen","state_code":null,"country_code":"DNK","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9986577-54.html","source_description":"Intel Capital spreads its solar bets with Sulfurcell","raised_amount":133700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"SulfurCell","permalink":"sulfurcell","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0002/1767/21767v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0002/1767/21767v1-max-250x250.png"],[[304,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/1767/21767v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2008/05/20/camsemi-raises-8m-for-energy-efficient-semiconductors/","source_description":"CamSemi raises $8M for energy-efficient semiconductors","raised_amount":8000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"CamSemi ","permalink":"camsemi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0003/7960/37960v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,114],"assets/images/resized/0003/7960/37960v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,114],"assets/images/resized/0003/7960/37960v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"Capital Report Index","raised_amount":9900000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"Enecsys","permalink":"enecsys","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/3714/63714v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0006/3714/63714v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[282,70],"assets/images/resized/0006/3714/63714v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.nujira.com/news_item.asp?nid=8","source_description":"Nujira secures $18 million in Series C funding","raised_amount":18000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"Nujira","permalink":"nujira","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0005/3387/53387v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,97],"assets/images/resized/0005/3387/53387v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[175,97],"assets/images/resized/0005/3387/53387v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/Borean_Pharma_2.htm","source_description":"Borean Pharma raises Euros 4 Million in series A fundraising","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"Borean Pharma","permalink":"borean-pharma","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
