As opposed to creating entirely new technology, TES/BIS companies leverage existing technology to solve business problems or create substantially improved efficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Tri-State region is the headquarters to over 30% of the Fortune 500 and has a strong focus on some of the largest industries including financial services, media, publishing, information services, retail and pharmaceuticals. The region is a rich environment for entrepreneurs to offer technology enabled services and business information services to these industries. In fact, we find that many of the entrepreneurs we back have deep domain expertise in one or more of these areas.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/9367/19367v1-max-150x150.png"],[[242,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/9367/19367v1-max-250x250.png"],[[242,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/9367/19367v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"300 Park Avenue","address2":"23rd Floor","zip_code":"10022","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.757027,"longitude":-73.974717}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91289.php","source_description":"","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2004,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Critical Media","permalink":"critical-media","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3058/3058v4-max-150x150.png"],[[243,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/3058/3058v4-max-250x250.png"],[[243,107],"assets/images/resized/0000/3058/3058v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163437134.html","source_description":"FTrans raises $7,500,000","raised_amount":7500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"FTRANS","permalink":"ftrans","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0004/4665/44665v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[241,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/4665/44665v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[241,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/4665/44665v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-166241078.html","source_description":"EXPOCAD and BDMetrics Inc. announced their alliance to integrate their technologies","raised_amount":15000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":27,"company":{"name":"Three Stage Media","permalink":"bdmetrics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0006/4703/64703v3-max-150x150.png"],[[186,118],"assets/images/resized/0006/4703/64703v3-max-250x250.png"],[[186,118],"assets/images/resized/0006/4703/64703v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":3450000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":7,"company":{"name":"BestContractors.com","permalink":"bestcontractors","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0006/4518/64518v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0006/4518/64518v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[286,63],"assets/images/resized/0006/4518/64518v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Managed Systems","permalink":"managed-systems","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Game+Trust+Closes+$9+Million+Series+B+Financing.-a0138707018","source_description":"Game Trust Closes $9 Million Series B Financing","raised_amount":9000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"Game Trust","permalink":"game-trust","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20021111/27798-knovel-adds-3-m-in-funding-.html","source_description":"Knovel Adds $3 M in Funding","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2002,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":11,"company":{"name":"Knovel","permalink":"knovel","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
