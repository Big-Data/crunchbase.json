Founded and run by long-time media investment bankers and former CEO&#8217;s, these entrepreneurs / financiers / investors / advisors have been fully immersed in and have helped shape the media landscape for the past 20 years, both offline and online. Such invaluable experience, well-honed insights and extensive relationships throughout the industry with both strategic operators and financial sponsors are of immense value to DCA&#8217;s clients as it helps them navigate the fast-changing media landscape and create superior value.</p>\n\n<p>DCA provides advisory services in the form of sell-side and buy-side M&amp;A, as well as the private placement of equity and debt, for digital media companies throughout their evolution. A key differentiator of the firm is its focus on seamlessly executing cross-border transactions, just as the digital world has knocked down those boundaries. The firm&#8217;s unique capabilities are enhanced by the soon to launch venture capital fund, &#8216;Entrepreneur&#8217;s Investment Fund&#8217; in the US and by its strategic alliance with eValue Group AG, a prolific and highly successful European venture capital fund, as well as other global alliances that have been formed over the years.</p>\n\n<p>From its headquarters in New York City, DCA&#8217;s principals span the globe uniting and building digital leaders of today and tomorrow. They regard their client relationships as partnerships in the true meaning of the word – unified with one another in a sphere of common interest – as they help entrepreneurs and other business owners transfer various forms of capital into tangible and significant wealth.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0018/5685/185685v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/5685/185685v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,135],"assets/images/resized/0018/5685/185685v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"24 W 40th Street","address2":"Floor 7","zip_code":"10018","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"Munich Office","address1":"Rosental 4","address2":"","zip_code":"80331","city":"München","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"C.
