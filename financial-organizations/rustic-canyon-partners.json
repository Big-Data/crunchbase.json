We are an early stage firm actively investing out of our third fund, raised in 2007. As the first or second institutional investor in a company, our investments range from $500,000 to $10 million. We focus on two sectors, which we believe will produce the most transformative commercial advances of our time: Internet &amp; Digital Media and Energy &amp; Efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>We are one of the largest VC firms in Los Angeles, and we have a strong and growing presence in the Bay Area. We invest primarily in these two regions, but we consider opportunities outside of California when we meet entrepreneurs with the talent and drive to create and capitalize on opportunity. Rustic Canyon was launched in 1999 by Founding Partner Tom Unterman, and is led by Managing Partner Nate Redmond.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to our core venture platform, we have partnered with the management of US Renewables Group, Rustic Canyon / Fontis and Saints Capital to form new funds that serve to deepen our expertise and extend our reach.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/3531/13531v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0001/3531/13531v5-max-250x250.png"],[[383,214],"assets/images/resized/0001/3531/13531v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"100
