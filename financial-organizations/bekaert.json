Their business is built on two core competences: advanced metal transformation and advanced materials and coatings. This unique combination of competences is Bekaertâ€™s strength.</p>\n\n<p>Their basic raw material is wire rod, steel wire about the thickness of a finger, which they convert by mechanical deformation and heat treatment into wires that can be as fine as 1/50th the thickness of a human hair. These wires are then turned into cable and cord, woven or knitted into cloth or processed into ultra-fine filters and fibers, for a wide range of industrial applications in virtually all sectors of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>They also develop coating technologies for their steel wires and fibers, adding even more value for the customer. As a business-to-business supplier, they take account both of their industrial customersâ€™ technological requirements and of their end-usersâ€™ wishes.</p>\n\n<p>Bekaert invests heavily in growth regions, such as China, India, Russia and Latin America, while working to strengthen its position in its traditional markets of Western Europe and North America. Bekaert aspires to both market and technological leadership. These are the forces driving their pursuit of Bekaertâ€™s strategic objective: sustainable and profitable growth.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/8932/28932v1-max-150x150.png"],[[194,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/8932/28932v1-max-250x250.png"],[[194,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/8932/28932v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"President Kennedypark 18","address2":"","zip_code":"B-8500","city":"Kortrijk","state_code":null,"country_code":"BEL","latitude":50.8005889,"longitude":3.2755138}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://cymbet.com/content/company-press-122104.asp","source_description":"Cymbetâ„¢ Secures $16.5 Million in Private Financing","raised_amount":16500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2004,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Cymbet","permalink":"cymbet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/8767/28767v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/8767/28767v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/8767/28767v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2010/01/cymbet-secures-31m-in-private-financing.html","source_description":"Cymbet Secures $31M in Private Financing","raised_amount":31000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"Cymbet","permalink":"cymbet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/8767/28767v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/8767/28767v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/8767/28767v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
