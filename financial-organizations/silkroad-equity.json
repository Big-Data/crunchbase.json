They manage their own capital and were founded by Andrew J. &#8220;Flip&#8221; Filipowski in May 2003.</p>\n\n<p>SilkRoad Equity invests in a wide range of opportunities&#8230;from start-ups to buy-outs, buy-ins, build-ups, spin-offs, and industry consolidations, focusing on those with high growth potential and strong management. Over the past 20 years, they have invested in or acquired over 150 companies with valuations ranging from $5-$500 million.</p>\n\n<p>SilkRoad Equity seeks investment opportunities which may be inappropriate for venture capital organizations, poorly understood by local buyout groups and/or overlooked by traditional capital sources.</p>\n\n<p>SilkRoad Equity typically makes $1 million to $20 million equity investments, alone or as part of a syndicate, and can go much higher given their stable of relationships with institutional investors. Their financial strength gives them the flexibility to provide follow up rounds of funding and support your business through differing market conditions.</p>\n\n<p>SilkRoad Equity is currently pursuing opportunities in the areas of      Technology, Media and Entertainment, Life Sciences, Telecommunications, Retail (food and non-food), Manufacturing and Business Services.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0003/0288/30288v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[197,27],"assets/images/resized/0003/0288/30288v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[197,27],"assets/images/resized/0003/0288/30288v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"111 North Chestnut Street,","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"27101","city":"Winston-Salem","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":36.0954225,"longitude":-80.2414883}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"J Filipowski","permalink":"andrew-j-filipowski-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/0290/30290v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[197,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/0290/30290v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[355,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/0290/30290v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Roszak","permalink":"matthew-roszak","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0007/8714/78714v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0007/8714/78714v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[320,240],"assets/images/resized/0007/8714/78714v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techjournalsouth.com/news/article.html?item_id=4829","source_description":"SilkRoad technology CEO sees rapid growth for HR applications firm","raised_amount":23000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2003,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"SilkRoad technology","permalink":"silkroad-technology","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/8668/18668v1-max-150x150.png"],[[188,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/8668/18668v1-max-250x250.png"],[[188,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/8668/18668v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_Feb_19/ai_n24266973","source_description":"SilkRoad technology, inc.
