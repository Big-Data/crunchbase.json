The fund was up over 50% in 2001, and reportedly was up big again in 2002. Referred to as a &#8220;Tiger Cub&#8221;, Tiger Technology is one of several funds loosely run under the old Tiger Management umbrella. Run by the famous Julian Robertson, Tiger Management shut down in 2000 after returning 31.5% per year (before fees) between 1980 and 2000. Julian Robertson was extensively profiled in a December 2002 Institutional Investor Magazine article that also included a description of the Tiger Technology Fund. </p>\n\n<p>More information <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=a.iQFhXn1DDE\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://blog.quintura.com/2008/01/29/will-yandex-go-ipo-in-2008/","source_description":"Quintura Blog","raised_amount":5300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2000,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Yandex","permalink":"yandex","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8947/18947v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0001/8947/18947v6-max-250x250.png"],[[360,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/8947/18947v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-turkish-social-net-yonja-gets-125","source_description":"Turkish Social Net Yonja Raises $12.5 Million","raised_amount":12500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"Yonja Media Group","permalink":"yonja","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0002/0131/20131v4-max-150x150.png"],[[210,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/0131/20131v4-max-250x250.png"],[[210,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/0131/20131v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":5250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Maktoob","permalink":"maktoob","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,96],"assets/images/resized/0004/7413/47413v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,112],"assets/images/resized/0004/7413/47413v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,112],"assets/images/resized/0004/7413/47413v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/n30-pharma-inc-series-b-10m/","source_description":"N30 Pharma, Inc.: Series B $10M","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"N30 Pharmaceuticals","permalink":"n30-pharmaceuticals","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,110],"assets/images/resized/0009/3099/93099v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,110],"assets/images/resized/0009/3099/93099v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,110],"assets/images/resized/0009/3099/93099v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/11/29/vostu-harvests-funds-from-facebook-zynga-backers/","source_description":"WSJ","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"Vostu","permalink":"vostu","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/0249/20249v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0002/0249/20249v6-max-250x250.png"],[[383,133],"assets/images/resized/0002/0249/20249v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/square-100-million-meeker/","source_description":"Square Closes That $100 Million Round, Mary Meeker Joins Board","raised_amount":100000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"Square","permalink":"square","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-150x150.png"],[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-250x250.png"],[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
