We are innovation capitalists, helping clients refine product concepts, prove market potential, and then attract large investors. By providing capital and strategic guidance, we lower your costs and raise your valuation. Our approach is to get each product we develop to market as quickly as possible. Because Arizona Bay incubates ideas - not company infrastructure - we reduce cash flow and speed up the development process. Our clients get to market sooner and get a higher valuation in subsequent funding rounds, as their product has already begun to generate revenue. Arizona Bay&#8217;s innovative investing can benefit a range of companies, including entrepreneurs with great ideas but limited experience raising capital or running a company. Inventors bring their breakthrough ideas - we bring design skills, organization building expertise, and seed funding.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0006/9081/69081v1-max-150x150.png"],[[220,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/9081/69081v1-max-250x250.png"],[[220,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/9081/69081v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3450 Sacramento St.","address2":"#510","zip_code":"94118","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Graham","permalink":"dave-graham","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Gibb","permalink":"jay-gibb","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Natland","permalink":"jeffrey-natland","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1471095/000147109509000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D/A","raised_amount":1325000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"quirky","permalink":"quirky","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6233/46233v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6233/46233v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/6233/46233v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/12/feefighters-raises-1-6-million-to-be-the-billshrink-for-business-services/","source_description":"FeeFighters Raises $1.6 Million To Be The BillShrink For Business Services","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"FeeFighters","permalink":"transparent-financial-services","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/2410/22410v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/2410/22410v9-max-250x250.png"],[[400,125],"assets/images/resized/0002/2410/22410v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
