ECI has been an active investor in private companies since it was established as Equity Capital for Industry in 1976, in response to the then Governmentâ€™s report on the equity gap for smaller companies.</p>\n\n<p>ECI has evolved and grown over the past three decades, both in terms of personnel and investment strategy. Today from its offices in London and Manchester the 21-strong executive team specialises in management buyouts, buyins and development capital deals with companies valued between Â£10 million to Â£150 million.</p>\n\n<p>Since our first management buyout investment in Ansafone in 1981, ECI has developed into one of the leading UK mid-market private equity firms with an enviable track record across multiple funds. In 1990, we adopted an exclusive focus on mid-market buyouts, and since then we have successfully sold 80 investments with a total value of over Â£2.5billion, creating significant value for both our investors and the management teams we have supported.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,56],"assets/images/resized/0010/1854/101854v1-max-150x150.png"],[[109,56],"assets/images/resized/0010/1854/101854v1-max-250x250.png"],[[109,56],"assets/images/resized/0010/1854/101854v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Brettenham House (South Entrance)  ","address2":"Lancaster Place  ","zip_code":"WC2E 7EN","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.m2digital.co.uk/index.php?content_id=107","source_description":"ECI Partners invests 12 million in M2 Digital","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"M2 Digital","permalink":"m2-digital","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,108],"assets/images/resized/0008/6678/86678v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[141,108],"assets/images/resized/0008/6678/86678v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[141,108],"assets/images/resized/0008/6678/86678v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/06/stewart-group-receives-12m-investment-eci.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Stewart Group Receives Â£12M Investment from ECI","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Stewart Group Holdings","permalink":"stewart-group-holdings","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0013/9654/139654v1-max-150x150.png"],[[225,65],"assets/images/resized/0013/9654/139654v1-max-250x250.png"],[[225,65],"assets/images/resized/0013/9654/139654v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
