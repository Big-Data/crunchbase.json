by Lucius Cary, and since 1983 has specialised in making and managing investments in start-up and early stage technology-based businesses with high growth prospects.</p>\n\n<p>The OTM team are all scientists or engineers by background, and understanding the technology is the starting point for any investment that we may make.</p>\n\n<p>The Investment policy of Oxford Technology Management is to construct a portfolio of investments with the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<p>unlisted, UK based, technology businesses\ninvestments typically in the range of Â£100,000 - Â£2,000,000, although it can then invest similar amounts in subsequent rounds\nin most cases located within easy reach of Oxford to allow a more &#8216;hands on&#8217; management strategy\nIt is expected that approximately half of the funds will be invested in early stage companies (those which have achieved some initial sales) and the balance in start-up companies which are at an earlier stage.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0007/3351/73351v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0007/3351/73351v1-max-250x250.png"],[[276,138],"assets/images/resized/0007/3351/73351v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"Magdalen
