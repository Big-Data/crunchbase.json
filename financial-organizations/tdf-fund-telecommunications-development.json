TDFâ€™s focus is driven by investment themes that share several qualities: large and important problems in communications, an ability to add value through managementâ€™s investing and operational experience, and the Fundâ€™s location and relationships in Washington, DC. While TDF is stage agnostic, half of the Fundâ€™s investments to date are in seed and pre-revenue companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[89,42],"assets/images/resized/0003/0284/30284v2-max-150x150.png"],[[89,42],"assets/images/resized/0003/0284/30284v2-max-250x250.png"],[[89,42],"assets/images/resized/0003/0284/30284v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1850 K Street NW Suite 1075","address2":"","zip_code":"20006","city":"Washington","state_code":"DC","country_code":"USA","latitude":38.9023881,"longitude":-77.0427434}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"J.
