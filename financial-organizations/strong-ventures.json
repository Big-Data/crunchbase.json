The founders of Strong Ventures have learned from their startup experiences that money is only one of the many ingredients to a ventureâ€™s success. We believe that the key ingredient lies in the hands-on knowledge transfer and mentoring at every stage of the startup lifecycle, and that every entrepreneur can do better with some of our mentoring. Together, with our experience and expertise, our goal is to identify, invest and advise early stage startups with the potential to disrupt the global market. Due to our background and experience, we are currently focused on supporting young Korean and American entrepreneurs interested in building successful, strong global ventures. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0021/0811/210811v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0021/0811/210811v1-max-250x250.png"],[[436,84],"assets/images/resized/0021/0811/210811v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"3435 Wilshire Boulevard","address2":"Suite 2700","zip_code":"90010","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Kihong","last_name":"Bae","permalink":"kihong-bae-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Nahm","permalink":"john-nahm-2","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/tapastic/","source_description":"500 Startups-Backed Tapastic Raises $750,000 To Bring Webtoons To US-Based Comic Fans","raised_amount":750000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"Tapas Media","permalink":"tapas-media","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0021/5144/215144v2-max-150x150.png"],[[220,70],"assets/images/resized/0021/5144/215144v2-max-250x250.png"],[[220,70],"assets/images/resized/0021/5144/215144v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[{"name":"Seed Fund","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":10,"raised_amount":330000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","source_url":"http://pevc.dowjones.com/article?an=DJFVW00020120910e89arfcz1&from=alert&pid=32&ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fpevc.dowjones.com%3a80%2farticle%3fan%3dDJFVW00020120910e89arfcz1%26from%3dalert%26pid%3d32","source_description":" Strong Ventures Gets $330K Toward $1M Seed Fund "}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
