YEurope may be a forerunner of changing times. <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/y-combinator\" title=\"Y Combinator\">Y Combinator</a>&#8217;s European cousin (or clone) is YEurope - a venture capital firm specializing in funding early stage European internet and communication technology startups. Similar to Y Combinator and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/techstars\" title=\"TechStars\">TechStars</a>, YEurope invests in startups based on the number of founders (1-3, 5000Ã¢â€šÂ¬/each) while taking a 2-10% stake in the company. YEurope believes that location should be no boundary for success and successful startup companies need not come from the Silicon Valley.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/1708/1708v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/1708/1708v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/1708/1708v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":"Rathausstrasse 6","address2":"","zip_code":"1010","city":"Vienna","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUT","latitude":48.209381,"longitude":16.356113}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Stephan","last_name":"Zeinler","permalink":"stephan-zeinler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/9982/9982v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/9982/9982v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,128],"assets/images/resized/0000/9982/9982v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Rohregger","permalink":"michael-rohregger","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/9979/9979v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/9979/9979v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,131],"assets/images/resized/0000/9979/9979v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"BÃ¶hm","permalink":"paul-b-aphm","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0000/9973/9973v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0000/9973/9973v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,130],"assets/images/resized/0000/9973/9973v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Lukas","last_name":"Zeinler","permalink":"lukas-zeinler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/9985/9985v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/9985/9985v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,90],"assets/images/resized/0000/9985/9985v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Oliver","last_name":"Olbrich","permalink":"oliver-olbrich","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,125],"assets/images/resized/0000/9976/9976v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,125],"assets/images/resized/0000/9976/9976v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,125],"assets/images/resized/0000/9976/9976v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://yeurope.net/","source_description":"YEurope","raised_amount":30000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Soup.io","permalink":"soup-io","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/1705/1705v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/1705/1705v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/1705/1705v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://blog.efficientcloud.com/2011/04/27/were-now-part-of-the-seedcamp-programme/","source_description":"Weâ€™re now part of the Seedcamp program!","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Efficient Cloud","permalink":"the-efficient-cloud","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0013/2187/132187v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0013/2187/132187v3-max-250x250.png"],[[400,85],"assets/images/resized/0013/2187/132187v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
