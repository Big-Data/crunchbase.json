They believed that their unique combination of skills and perspectives could help entrepreneurs to build companies which would have significant clinical impact and generate superior returns. Seven years later, this belief continues to hold true, demonstrated by our investment success in selected medical device and biotechnology companies.<br/>\nWith $650 million under management, De Novo has made more than 40 investments in medical devices and biotechnology across three funds. We invest in all stages of enterprise development and growth â€“ from early stage to late stage. Our unique background of leading companies as entrepreneurs and operating executives from start to exit enables us to advise entrepreneurs and management teams over the full life cycle of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Eight exits have occurred in DNV I &#8211; four IPOs: Favrille (NASDAQ: FVRL), Fox Hollow Technologies (NASDAQ: EVVV), Renovis (NASDAQ: RNVS), and SenoRx (NASDAQ: SENO) and four acquisitions: CryoVascular Systems (Boston Scientific), TriVascular (Boston Scientific), LuMend (Johnson and Johnson) and Microvention (Terumo). DNV II has had one exit to date â€“ Hansen Medical (NASDAQ: HNSN).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/5371/45371v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/5371/45371v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,77],"assets/images/resized/0004/5371/45371v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"400 Hamilton Avenue","address2":"Suite 300","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.4463449,"longitude":-122.1590785}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"CATHY","last_name":"MINSHALL","permalink":"cathy-minshall","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5372/45372v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5372/45372v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5372/45372v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"MD","person":{"first_name":"FREDERICK","last_name":"DOTZLER","permalink":"frederick-dotzler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5378/45378v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5378/45378v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5378/45378v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"MD","person":{"first_name":"JOE","last_name":"MANDATO","permalink":"joe-mandato","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5375/45375v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5375/45375v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5375/45375v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"MD","person":{"first_name":"JAY","last_name":"WATKINS","permalink":"jay-watkins","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5373/45373v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5373/45373v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5373/45373v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"MD","person":{"first_name":"RICHARD","last_name":"M.
