At this time, the senior management and energy professionals of Panda Energy were transferred to the new fund organization. Since its inception in 1982, the Panda team has developed, financed, constructed and operated large-scale energy facilities both domestically and internationally. The company built the two largest gas-fueled electric generation facilities in the United States totaling 4,500 megawatts of generating capacity. Altogether, Panda has raised almost U.S. $6 billion to develop and build more than 9,000 megawatts of generating capacity. In 2005, Newsweek Magazine recognized Panda as one of the ten most eco-friendly energy companies in the United States.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,78],"assets/images/resized/0016/2726/162726v1-max-150x150.png"],[[149,78],"assets/images/resized/0016/2726/162726v1-max-250x250.png"],[[149,78],"assets/images/resized/0016/2726/162726v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"4100 Spring Valley Road","address2":"Suite 1001","zip_code":"75244","city":"Dallas","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"W.
