Their partners and many of their investors have deep roots in the region and share a common purpose of supporting local entrepreneurism and technology development.</p>\n\n<p>Southern California has one of the largest concentrations of emerging companies and pools of engineering talent in the country. Yet, the region has been chronically underserved by local sources of venture capital. Entrepreneurs need not only the funding but responsiveness, attention and support from their investors to build successful companies. Simply put, their mission is to apply their capital, experience, skills and resources to support talented and highly motivated entrepreneurs to create the next wave of successful technology companies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/0999/30999v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,107],"assets/images/resized/0003/0999/30999v1-max-250x250.png"],[[264,114],"assets/images/resized/0003/0999/30999v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Orange County Office","address1":"2101 E.
