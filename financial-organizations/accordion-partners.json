Clients turn to Accordion as an in-house team to execute highly-analytical operational projects and to lead mergers and acquisitions, capital raises and refinancings where an investment bank is often unneeded, but where clients traditionally had nowhere else to turn. By deploying its team of former investment banking and fund professionals to clients in a project-oriented and variable cost manner, Accordion provides an efficient and effective alternative to the often-prohibitive fee structures of investment banks and management consultancies. Since inception, Accordion has worked globally to realize more than a 50% reduction in transaction and deal team fees for its clients.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0018/3667/183667v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[162,47],"assets/images/resized/0018/3667/183667v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[162,47],"assets/images/resized/0018/3667/183667v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"270 Lafayette Street","address2":"2nd Floor","zip_code":"10012","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
