They focus on providing capital to leading technology companies in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.</p>\n\n<p>Southern Capitol Ventures are currently investing out of Fund II and their initial investments range in size from as little as $75k to as much as $1 million. Typically, they invest $500k initially and $1.5 million over the life of the company. While they focus on early-stage companies they will always consider later stage opportunities and spinouts where they partner with larger VC funds.</p>\n\n<p>They deploy a very disciplined investment strategy, partnering with companies where they have significant knowledge and domain expertise. These industries include: e-commerce, software, digital media, wireless and healthcare IT. They are often the first investor to become involved with a company.</p>\n\n<p>Southern Capitol Ventures also limit the number of companies in which they invest to ensure that our portfolio companies get the attention they need to succeed. Their unique approach gives them one of the highest partner-to-company ratios in the industry.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0003/0447/30447v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0003/0447/30447v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,70],"assets/images/resized/0003/0447/30447v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Raleigh Office","address1":"21 Glenwood Avenue,","address2":"Suite 105","zip_code":"27603","city":"Raleigh","state_code":"NC","country_code":"USA","latitude":35.781764,"longitude":-78.647905}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founding Partner","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Brooks","permalink":"ben-brooks","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Administrative Operations","person":{"first_name":"Cindy","last_name":"Kasner","permalink":"cindy-kasner","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Caplain","permalink":"jason-caplain","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","person":{"first_name":"Al","last_name":"Childers","permalink":"al-childers","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"S.
