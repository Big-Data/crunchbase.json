As such, they invested in late stage Israeli companies seeking to either access the Chinese market or enhance their existing business activities in China. In turn, they invested in Chinese operational enterprises that display well established entrepreneurial, sales and production skills, which are seeking to license cutting edge technology and knowhow. This symbiotic relationship has proved to be fruitful to both entities.</p>\n\n<p>Their investment team, located both in China and Israel, consists of talented and globally connected professionals who have gained extensive experience in investment management and private equity, technology and operational management. Infinity Team leverages their knowledge, connections, network and support to assist portfolio companies in seizing new opportunities for substantial growth.</p>\n\n<p>Credibility and reputation have enabled them to establish vital and trusted relationships with China, its authorities and business community, opening investment and development opportunities for both Israel and China. Successful launching the I-China fund in 2004 was evident in that it was the first limited partnership off shore fund fully endorsed by both the Chinese and Israeli governments. With offices in Tel Aviv, Suzhou, Shanghai and Hong Kong, Infinity is ideally positioned to assist portfolio companies in realizing their full potential.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/1931/31931v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,110],"assets/images/resized/0003/1931/31931v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,110],"assets/images/resized/0003/1931/31931v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Israel
