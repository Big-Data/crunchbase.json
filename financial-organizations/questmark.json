Since its founding in 1998, QuestMark&#8217;s collaborative, insightful, and patient approach to company building has helped many entrepreneurial teams grow and succeed as market leaders across a range of industries.</p>\n\n<p>*We initially invest $5 to $15 million and retain the reserve capacity to fund continued organic growth or acquisitions in follow-on rounds. We have the flexibility to invest in a number of financing situations, ranging from a new lead in an existing venture-backed syndicate to first institutional round and direct secondaries. We typically invest within the last two rounds of private financing.</p>\n\n<p>*We have backed companies in many sectors that meet our core investment criteria: strong management teams, clear differentiation in attractive market opportunities, and long term growth potential. Particular areas of interest have been, but are not limited to, enterprise software and software-as-a-service (SaaS), communications, internet and tech-enabled businesses, digital media, semi-conductors, medical devices, healthcare services, and consumer. We are open-minded, work hard to understand each business, and look for reasons to like every opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>*We typically lead financings, but are comfortable participating in syndicates where we believe the co-investors are financially stable and dedicated to long-term value creation.</p>\n\n<p>*QuestMark works most often with its portfolio companies through Board seats or as Observers to the Board. We also leverage our networks to identify impactful Board members at the appropriate time in a company&#8217;s growth.</p>\n\n<p>*We are Baltimore-based (from our original Alex. Brown heritage), but have a national footprint and presence. We invest where we find the best companies and teams.</p>\n\n<p>*QuestMark has over $750 million under management in three funds. We are currently investing QuestMark Fund III, a $300 million fund.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0004/6880/46880v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,25],"assets/images/resized/0004/6880/46880v1-max-250x250.png"],[[328,33],"assets/images/resized/0004/6880/46880v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"QuestMark Partners","address1":"One South Street","address2":"Suite 800","zip_code":"21202","city":"Baltimore","state_code":"MD","country_code":"USA","latitude":39.289273,"longitude":-76.610725}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & partner","person":{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"S.
