The firm is based in Europe and the USA and focuses on making investments in European and North American companies. \nTowerBrook pursues control-oriented investments in large and middle market companies, partnering with highly capable management teams and seeking situations characterised by complexity. TowerBrook has approximately $5 billion under management. \nWe invest first to transform and then to build businesses. To this end, we have developed an investment strategy based on the twin principles of superior sourcing and adding value to each company we acquire.\nThe success of this strategy is rooted in the networks developed over many years by the TowerBrook team. Through our collective experience and the depth of our relationships on both sides of the Atlantic, we focus our efforts on transactions developed on an exclusive basis, seeking inefficiency while avoiding competition and auctions. We actively seek complex situations that others avoid but where we identify attractive potential for internal and external growth. We place the highest importance on disciplined execution. When we acquire a business, it is after careful evaluation and with a business plan and a management solution in place. Our ability to add value to our investments is based on a combination of rigorous analysis and effective partnering with experienced, talented managers. Drawing on their and our expertise, we aim to optimise the performance of our portfolio companies, building substantial value through market cycles.\nThe value we create in our investments over time reflects our understanding of how to balance entrepreneurial flair and passion â€“ the spark that ignites business ideas â€“ with the discipline required to achieve the right price, structure and timing. \nWe work as a single, integrated team that has grown in parallel in the Europe and the USA since the inception of TowerBrook. A multinational and cross-cultural approach nourishes flexibility and enables us to act with speed and certainty in multiple jurisdictions.\nWherever we are present, we encourage our partners and portfolio companies to share our commitment to giving back to our communities. Together, we are actively involved in helping to renew and improve the places in which we do
