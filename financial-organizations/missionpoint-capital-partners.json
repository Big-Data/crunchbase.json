They leverage disciplined research, origination and execution capabilities to create a diversified portfolio of high quality investments within the clean energy and environmental finance sectors.</p>\n\n<p>MissionPoint Capital Partners believes that mounting environmental constraints are driving a significant transformation in the way business is conducted, creating a rising demand for clean technologies across all sectors of the global economy. As a result, MissionPoint Capital Partners believes that they are in the early stages of a fundamental and long-term transition to a low-carbon economy, requiring trillions of dollars in capital expenditures as well as the deployment of alternative technologies and business models. A number of other uncorrelated macro drivers are reinforcing the demand for clean energy and environmental finance-related businesses, including:</p>\n\n<p>Global energy demand\nIncreasing energy price volatility\nExpanding policy stimulus and development of environmental commodity markets\nImproving economics of alternative energy solutions\nGlobal energy industry deregulation</p>\n\n<p>MissionPoint Capital Partnersâ€™ first investment vehicle, a private equity fund, MPCP Fund I, closed in January 2007 with $335m in investment capital. Their LP base is comprised of like-minded, sophisticated investors and include HNW individuals, institutions, endowments, foundations, and partnerships.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/9199/29199v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/9199/29199v2-max-250x250.png"],[[359,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/9199/29199v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"20 Marshall Street","address2":"Suite 300","zip_code":"06854","city":"Norwalk","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.100736,"longitude":-73.417386}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Schwartz","permalink":"mark-schwartz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Cirilli","permalink":"mark-cirilli-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Lewis","permalink":"mark-lewis-2","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/19/trilliant-raises-40-million-for-work-on-smart-power-grid/","source_description":"Trilliant Raises $40 Million For Work On Smart Power Grid","raised_amount":40000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":19,"company":{"name":"Trilliant","permalink":"trilliant","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/3856/23856v4-max-150x150.png"],[[125,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/3856/23856v4-max-250x250.png"],[[125,23],"assets/images/resized/0002/3856/23856v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/27/sunedison-raises-161-million-for-solar-services-and-installing/","source_description":"SunEdison raises $161 million for solar services and installing","raised_amount":131000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"SunEdison","permalink":"sunedison","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0004/6258/46258v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/6258/46258v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/6258/46258v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/27/sunedison-raises-161-million-for-solar-services-and-installing/","source_description":"SunEdison raises $161 million for solar services and installing","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"SunEdison","permalink":"sunedison","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0004/6258/46258v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/6258/46258v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/6258/46258v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"UpWind Solutions","permalink":"upwind-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"Thomson","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"UpWind Solutions","permalink":"upwind-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.nwinnovation.com/upwind_solutions_scores__8_8m/s-0027498.html","source_description":"Northwest Innovation","raised_amount":28800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"UpWind Solutions","permalink":"upwind-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,65],"assets/images/resized/0005/7730/57730v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2009/11/utility_scale_p_1.html","source_description":"Utility Scale Panel Maker Amonix Raises $40M;
