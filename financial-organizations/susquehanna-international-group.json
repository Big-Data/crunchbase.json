They envisioned creating a company that would combine their intellectual capabilities, decision making skills, and capital resources to compete in the world&#8217;s options and securities markets. Pooling their strengths, they were able to make strong trading decisions and, over time, surpassed the competition.   </p>\n\n<p>Today, the Susquehanna International Group of Companies (SIG)* continues to grow by focusing on the same basic principles: exercise sound decision making and focus on positive expectancy. And even though they have grown to be a worldwide team of more than 1,500, they hold true to the casual, collaborative atmosphere that&#8217;s the foundation.
