They have funded companies developing nanoscale-enabled solutions in solid state lighting, emerging memory devices, printable electronics, material science discovery and mass-manufacturing, organic-inorganic hybrids, next-generation semiconductor devices and equipment, thermoelectric, photovoltaic and battery technologies, as well as in various life-science applications of nano-structured materials.</p>\n\n<p>They participate in venture capital syndicates in most of their investments, alongside top-tier venture capital firms as well as strategic (corporate) investors. Increasingly, Harris &amp; Harris Group is a lead investor. They believe in the classical early stage venture capital model and disciplines and that most technology-based start-ups can use all the help they can get from the diversified experiences, RolodexesÂ®, complimentary business networks, technical expertise, up-to-date customer connections and financial resources that a syndicate of professional venture capital investors can provide.</p>\n\n<p>Harris &amp; Harris Group will invest at any stage prior to a company&#8217;s initial public offering, and they will invest anywhere in the United States. Occasionally, they have also made private investments in publicly held companies (so-called &#8220;PIPE&#8221; investments). They have invested outside the United States, but rarely. Their current portfolio companies are distributed all across the country, plus one in Canada.</p>\n\n<p>Harris &amp; Harris Group is looking for scientific, technological, business and execution excellence. They are attracted to markets of significant size and back passionate entrepreneurs who want to change the world with their tiny technology-enabled products.</p>\n\n<p>Proprietary, well-protected and highly differentiated technology is a prerequisite. But above all, they are eager to invest in companies with market-centric strategies that seek to define and dominate large product categories.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/2214/32214v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/2214/32214v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,125],"assets/images/resized/0003/2214/32214v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Corporate Headquarters","address1":"1450 Broadway, 24th Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"10019","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.7646671,"longitude":-73.9780083},{"description":"California Office","address1":"530 Lytton Avenue, 2nd Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"E.
