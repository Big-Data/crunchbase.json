The initial equity investment is coupled with an option to a specific therapeutic program giving early validation for the startup companyâ€™s technology or programs by a large Pharma. However the scope of the option is limited. That is, the subject of the option is not customarily a lead or necessarily even an active program for the start up at the time of investment. Rather the option is structured in such a manner as to provide the young company with the potential for an additional opportunity for success. Thus the option must be consistent with the new companyâ€™s corporate development plans. Moreover, the option is limited in duration in order to maintain the full potential for the start-up company in the market. In addition to the non dilutive cash payment to secure an option to a specific program, license terms are negotiated at the time of investment and are based upon benchmarks term relevant for the stage of the asset at the time of option exercise.</p>\n\n<p>The Option Fund has an initial size of USD 200 mio. The fund anticipates a total equity investment over the years of up to USD 20 mio per company. Investments are reviewed by a dedicated advisory board with a majority of external members, chaired by Dr. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas of Harvard Medical School. The focus of investments is on early stage, high risk / high return areas enabling the development of novel programs and technologies that may be complementary to Novartisâ€™ research endeavors. While they couple investments with a limited option for Novartis, they are committed to build companies that will be attractive to many other life science partners in the biotech and pharma arena. Thus they finance in a syndicate along with other venture capitalists and the new financing model shall be to the benefit of all parties involved.</p>\n\n<p>The Option Fund targets two or more investments per year with 2009 investments having been made in Heptares Therapeutics, Viamet Pharmaceuticals and Avila Therapeutics.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0007/3160/73160v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,32],"assets/images/resized/0007/3160/73160v1-max-250x250.png"],[[373,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/3160/73160v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Novartis International AG, Forum 1-3.73","address2":"P.O.
