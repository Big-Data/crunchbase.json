They focus on profitable companies that deliver cost-effective services and have the ability to gain market share in industry segments that are typically large, growing, fragmented and poised for consolidation. Investment targets are primarily U.S. companies with valuations of $25 million to $300 million, although we will selectively invest equity capital in larger transactions in partnership with other leading private equity funds.</p>\n\n<p>They have over 50 years of experience working with companies within our target sectors and have invested in or advised over 100 such companies during our careers.
