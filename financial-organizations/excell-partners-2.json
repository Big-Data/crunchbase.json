Although it is a not-for-profit organization, Excell maintains a for-profit discipline by structuring each investment with convertible debt and equity returns so that, over time, the fund becomes self-sustaining or evergreen.</p>\n\n<p>Excell Partners is a unique regional economic development partnership established in cooperation with the University of Rochester and the State of New York to manage a state-supported fund which provides pre-seed and seed stage financing to high-tech start-up companies in the Upstate New York region. </p>\n\n<p>Because of the high risks inherent in very early stage investing, few venture funds make seed investments, particularly in this region. Yet a tremendous research base exists in Upstate NY which generates commercializable technologies. Excell Partners is positioned to tap into this research base, help identify promising technologies, and accelerate the creation of new technology-based businesses which offer high potential for commercial success.  In particular, we provide the financing necessary to launch these companies and link them with the critical services, mentoring, and follow-on capital they need to become self-sustaining businesses. </p>\n\n<p>The mission of the fund is to support regional economic development by bridging the pre-seed and seed stage funding gap in Upstate NY while generating sufficient returns so that, over time, the fund becomes self-sustaining.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,87],"assets/images/resized/0005/0287/50287v1-max-150x150.png"],[[143,87],"assets/images/resized/0005/0287/50287v1-max-250x250.png"],[[143,87],"assets/images/resized/0005/0287/50287v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"160 Linden Oaks Drive, Suite E, Rochester, NY  14625","address2":"","zip_code":"14625","city":"Rochester","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":43.123351,"longitude":-77.517575}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Theresa","last_name":"B.
