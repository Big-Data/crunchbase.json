The Fund provides seed capital, typically ranging between $50,000 and $200,000, to selected businesses. Over its lifetime, BRV will invest up to $10,000,000 in business entities, most of which will be sourced through the extended Cornell community. BRV is funded by donations to the University and returns are used to create a growing pool of investment capital and build the endowment.</p>\n\n<p>The Fund has undertaken several initiatives to facilitate the commercialization of Cornell technology and to expand the scope of entrepreneurship throughout the extended Cornell community. These initiatives include the $10,000 Cornell Venture Challenge, partnering with Cornell&#8217;s technology transfer office-CCTEC, participation in the Cornell Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Club&#8217;s annual symposium, working to build a strong relationship with Entrepreneurship@Cornell, and developing an extensive network among alumni. BRV has also developed informal relationships with a number of unaffiliated later stage venture capital firms and incubators.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0009/9119/99119v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0009/9119/99119v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,274],"assets/images/resized/0009/9119/99119v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Cornell University","address1":"304 Sage Hall","address2":"","zip_code":"14853-6201","city":"Ithaca","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"COO & Fund Manager","person":{"first_name":"Vinay","last_name":"Badami","permalink":"vinay-badami","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Fund Manager","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Stuckey","permalink":"brian-stuckey","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/8979/38979v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/8979/38979v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/8979/38979v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Fund Manager","person":{"first_name":"CJ","last_name":"Halabi","permalink":"cj-halabi","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"COO & Fund Manager","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"Holiday","permalink":"aaron-holiday","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/0933/130933v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[161,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/0933/130933v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,330],"assets/images/resized/0013/0933/130933v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Fund Manager","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Kurdziel","permalink":"chris-kurdziel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8453/128453v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,249],"assets/images/resized/0012/8453/128453v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[249,249],"assets/images/resized/0012/8453/128453v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Fund Manager","person":{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Castro","permalink":"carlos-castro","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/br-venture-fund-backs-restaurant-revolution-technologies-128876688.html","source_description":"BR Venture Fund Backs Restaurant Revolution Technologies","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Restaurant Revolution Technologies","permalink":"restaurant-revolution-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0015/2337/152337v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0015/2337/152337v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,52],"assets/images/resized/0015/2337/152337v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://techli.com/2012/06/scriptpad-bad-penmanship/","source_description":"ScriptPad Prevents Your Doctorâ€™s Bad Penmanship From Killing You","raised_amount":420000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"ScriptPad","permalink":"scriptpad","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/2016/92016v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0009/2016/92016v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[260,60],"assets/images/resized/0009/2016/92016v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
