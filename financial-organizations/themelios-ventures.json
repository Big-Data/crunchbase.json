The fund typically invests in life sciences technologies in the fields of diabetes, obesity cancer, and nutrition. It focuses on the research originating from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center and also aims to draw in companies from outside of Louisiana. The fund prefers to invest between $100,000 and $3 million and seeks to make half of the investments outside the Louisiana area with the other half being commercialized from Penningtonâ€™s center. The investment outside the Louisiana area should also some tie with Pennington center, either through a clinical trial or a sponsored research agreement.</p>","image":null,"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"29 Constitution Court","address2":"","zip_code":"10987","city":"Tuxedo Park","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=PR&Date=20110601&ID=13713866&topic=TOPIC_FINANCING&isub=1","source_description":"Esperance Pharmaceuticals Completes $7.5 Million Series B Financing","raised_amount":7500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Esperance Pharmaceuticals","permalink":"esperance-pharmaceuticals","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0013/7401/137401v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/7401/137401v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[419,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/7401/137401v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/embera-neurotherapeutics-raises-4-5m-series-financing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Embera NeuroTherapeutics Raises $4.5M in Series A Financing","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Embera NeuroTherapeutics","permalink":"embera-neurotherapeutics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0014/9520/149520v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[165,118],"assets/images/resized/0014/9520/149520v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[165,118],"assets/images/resized/0014/9520/149520v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
