Our group is made up of individuals with broad experience in general management, entrepreneurship, finance, consulting and law. The involvement of the group in portfolio companies will vary from deal to deal. Our portfolio companies will have access to the group for general advice and direct involvement by individual members where we can make a difference to a portfolio investment. Potential roles for Harvard Angels include â€œmoney only investorâ€, Board member, CEO mentor and advisor/consultant.</p>\n\n<p>Harvard Angels invests in early stage companies across all industry sectors located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ideal candidates are companies seeking $250,000 to $1,500,000. Harvard Angels invest as individuals, in aggregate up to $350,000 in any particular investment. We invest in â€œfor profitâ€ businesses, and expect our portfolio companies to achieve a successful exit within five years. We do not invest in R&amp;D intensive businesses or businesses with high capital requirements. We strongly encourage business plan submissions from Harvard Alumni, but consider all investments based on potential economic returns.</p>\n\n<p>Harvard Angels Invests In These Industries: Business Products and Services, IT Services, Clean Technology, Internet / Web Services, Consumer Products and Services, Media and Entertainment, Electronics / Instrumentation, Medical Devices and Equipment, Gaming, Mobile, Healthcare Services, Software</p>","image":null,"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":935000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Grouply","permalink":"grouply","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/11/grouply-closes-13-million-round/","source_description":"","raised_amount":365000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Grouply","permalink":"grouply","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-discussion-board-organizer-grouply-raises-13-million-first-round/","source_description":"Discussion Organizer Grouply Raises $1.3 Million First Round","raised_amount":1300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Grouply","permalink":"grouply","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,53],"assets/images/resized/0000/1015/1015v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":1310000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Blue Buzz Network","permalink":"blue-buzz-network","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2011/03/03/5352862.htm","source_description":"Glue Networks Secures $4.5 Million in Series A Financing ","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Glue Networks","permalink":"glue-networks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0012/4919/124919v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[241,78],"assets/images/resized/0012/4919/124919v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[241,78],"assets/images/resized/0012/4919/124919v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Koolanoo Group","permalink":"koolanoo-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/3609/23609v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/3609/23609v1-max-250x250.png"],[[418,78],"assets/images/resized/0002/3609/23609v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
