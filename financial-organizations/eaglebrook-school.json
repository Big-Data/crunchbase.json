It is located on the Pocumtuck Range near Deerfield Academy and sited on a 750-acre (3.0 km2) campus which is also preserved by the Deerfield Wildlife Trust. Eaglebrook has a student body of approximately 280 boys in grades six to nine (forms 3 through 6). Girls may only attend if their parents work or live on campus. Eaglebrook has its own alpine ski area (the Easton Ski Area), indoor swimming pool and a state-of-the-art hockey rink arena indoors. Whipple Pond, located in the center of campus, is stocked with trout and bass for fishing in the spring and fall. In the winter the pond serves as the water source for snowmaking. The Chase Learning Center, at the heart of campus, includes classrooms and a multi-purpose assembly area which is called the &#8220;Pit&#8221;. There are two other classroom buildings for science, and for arts, including digital photography, woodworking shops, stained glass and many more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0002/8361/28361v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/8361/28361v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/8361/28361v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"271 Pine Nook Road","address2":"","zip_code":"01342 ","city":"Deerfield","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.5423588,"longitude":-72.5876146}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2007/07/checkmate_chess.html","source_description":null,"raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"ChessPark","permalink":"chesspark","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/9412/19412v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,137],"assets/images/resized/0001/9412/19412v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,137],"assets/images/resized/0001/9412/19412v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaglebrook_School","title":"Wikipedia Info for Eaglebrook School"}]}
