Mr. Burke has used this quantitative/qualitative methodology successfully since developing it in 1992, and continues his portfolio management style as co-portfolio manager for Beacon Street Capital.</p>\n\n<p>We are an active, growth oriented large-cap manager but we do not exclude &#8220;value&#8221; stocks with strong growth potential. Our investment objectives are accomplished by exploiting market inefficiencies related to security-specific accounting anomalies applied to a long-only equity strategy. We offer three investment strategies as Separately Managed Accounts:</p>\n\n<p>Institutional LCG: Large-cap growth strategy designed to generate excess returns with a high correlation to its benchmark while being fully invested through all market cycles.</p>\n\n<p>S&amp;P500/Select: Large-cap growth strategy which seeks consistent excess returns from stocks selected from the S&amp;P500, with a default to cash to lower volatility.  This product is suitable for conservative investors with a time horizon of 5 years and who seek growth and dividend income.</p>\n\n<p>DowJones/Select: Mega-cap growth strategy which seeks consistent excess returns from stocks chosen from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a default to cash to lower volatility.  This product is suitable for conservative investors with a time horizon of 5 years and who seek growth and higher dividend income.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0010/0393/100393v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/0393/100393v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[359,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/0393/100393v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"3350 Riverwood Parkway","address2":"Suite 1900 - PMB1941 ","zip_code":"30339","city":"Atlanta","state_code":"GA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.smartinsulin.com/news/news_main.html","source_description":"SmartCells Completes Series D Preferred Stock Financing","raised_amount":4100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"SmartCells","permalink":"smartcells","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0009/4528/94528v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,45],"assets/images/resized/0009/4528/94528v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,45],"assets/images/resized/0009/4528/94528v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
