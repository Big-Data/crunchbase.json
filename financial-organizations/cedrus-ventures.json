Lebanon is a country of thriving entrepreneurship, but with relatively little VCPE activity â€“ a gap that creates opportunities. Cedrus Venturesâ€™ mission is to give investors access to these opportunities in the Lebanese market. It does this by directly addressing the factors that render VCPE difficult in Lebanon, factors such as a mentality that rejects ceding equity, and a higher country risk than in the developed world. Cedrus Ventures, by the nature of its focus, invests long term in risky areas â€“ and allows its investors to make such risky investments with peace of mind. Cedrus goes to great length to reduce and manage the risk, and furthermore, its management directly puts its own money where its recommendations are, co-investing with its investors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0015/5615/155615v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,32],"assets/images/resized/0015/5615/155615v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,32],"assets/images/resized/0015/5615/155615v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Fakhoury Bldg","address2":"Adib Ishaq St., Ashrafieh","zip_code":"","city":"Beirut","state_code":null,"country_code":"LBN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
