We look for technologies that are innovative, original, proprietary, scalable and that have a potential enterprise value, when commercialized, of â‚¬100 million or more. Sargas acquires early stage technologies and invests in their development and commercialization. We also enter into strategic partnerships to co-develop and finance game changing technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Sargas believes that there is opportunity now, during this financial unease, to acquire or partner with companies at minimal costs due to capital funding constraints. Even though many companies face these funding constraints, the most recent technology IPOs in the Internet and social networking space have proven that innovation is as vibrant as ever. Sargas offers investors the chance to participate in high growth ideas by creating funding opportunities for early stages investments.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0018/5208/185208v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0018/5208/185208v2-max-250x250.png"],[[342,123],"assets/images/resized/0018/5208/185208v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Canadian Headquarters","address1":"1920 Yonge Street","address2":"Suite 200","zip_code":"M4S 3E2","city":"Toronto","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Dariyanani","permalink":"jonathan-dariyanani","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Braun","permalink":"peter-braun","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Finance and Strategy","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Hirszel","permalink":"thomas-hirszel","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Communications","person":{"first_name":"Joanna","last_name":"Schneier","permalink":"joanna-schneier","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6101/146101v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,214],"assets/images/resized/0014/6101/146101v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[134,214],"assets/images/resized/0014/6101/146101v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Joanna Schneier</p>"}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120302005746/en/Sargas-Capital-Commits-Majority-Ownership-Kontexto","source_description":"Sargas Capital Commits to Majority Ownership of Kontexto","raised_amount":10500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Kontexto","permalink":"kontexto","image":null}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
