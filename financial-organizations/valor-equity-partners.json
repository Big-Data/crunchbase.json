Valor begins by identifying market segments and industries which it believes exhibit positive long-term demand dynamics that will support stable revenues from existing business lines, potential revenue and earnings growth, and attractive return on capital. Within these markets, the Firm invests in lower middle market companies which have sustainable revenues derived from a strategic or niche market position, but present complex, difficult due diligence issues and face constraints to revenue growth, profitability improvements and enhanced returns on capital that limit the development into larger market growth companies. Such constraints typically involve inadequate strategic planning, expansion capital, marketing infrastructure, process improvement techniques, information systems and/or human resource infrastructure. Valor works with management first to solve the due diligence issues and then to remove the potential constraints by providing the company with the operational change capacity typically found only in larger organizations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/9733/29733v1-max-150x150.png"],[[143,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/9733/29733v1-max-250x250.png"],[[143,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/9733/29733v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"200 South Michigan Avenue","address2":"Suite 1020","zip_code":"60604","city":"Chicago","state_code":"IL","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.878896,"longitude":-87.625067}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice Presidents","person":{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Macatangay","permalink":"jason-macatangay","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice Presidents","person":{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"B.
