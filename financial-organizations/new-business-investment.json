We take a research driven, thematic approach to investing. The General Partners identify a market opportunity that we believe is ripe for entrepreneurial innovation and then look for the best ideas and people within it. We may spend one month or a year investigating a particular sector. We will meet top executives and the best newly emerging companies. We will meet with companies in adjacent markets. Sometimes we will make an investment or two in a particular space and sometimes we will not.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,134],"assets/images/resized/0010/2836/102836v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,143],"assets/images/resized/0010/2836/102836v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,143],"assets/images/resized/0010/2836/102836v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"410 Jessie Street","address2":"Suite 501 ","zip_code":"94103","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.regimmune.com/news/000045.php","source_description":"REGiMMUNE Closes First Tranche of Series B Financing","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"REGiMMUNE Corporation","permalink":"regimmune-corporation","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/0419/70419v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/0419/70419v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[229,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/0419/70419v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.regimmune.com/news/000038.php","source_description":"REGiMMUNE Announces Series A Financing","raised_amount":4200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"REGiMMUNE Corporation","permalink":"regimmune-corporation","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/0419/70419v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/0419/70419v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[229,58],"assets/images/resized/0007/0419/70419v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
