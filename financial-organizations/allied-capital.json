Albright nearly defined the tenant-landlord partnership early in his career when he assisted a digital equipment company with its rapid expansion in the 1980â€™s. Through site selection, space planning and lease negotiation, Harry created a strategic plan that catered to the company&#8217;s specific real estate requirements. </p>\n\n<p>He has used his insight to assist a number of well-known corporations in similar situations, working closely to learn their business thoroughly so that he could help ensure their success. Harry still approaches all business relationships as a partnership. \nTo assist him, he has built a team of professionals with backgrounds in development, leasing &amp; marketing, construction, finance, accounting, property management, brokerage, and restaurant and retail management. Whether your company requires retail, office or light industrial space, in Michigan or in Florida, his team has the ability to help create a real estate strategy for any sized business.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0009/9811/99811v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0009/9811/99811v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[330,128],"assets/images/resized/0009/9811/99811v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"2620 West Michigan","address2":"Suite A","zip_code":"49006","city":"Kalamazoo","state_code":"MI","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Allied+Capital+Invests+$49.5+Million+in+Leading+Provider+of...-a0173910193","source_description":"Allied Capital Invests $49.5 Million in Leading Provider of Interactive Classroom Solutions","raised_amount":49500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"eInstruction","permalink":"einstruction","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/1935/71935v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0007/1935/71935v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/1935/71935v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.dvs.tv/press/press14.htm","source_description":"Allied Capital Invests $28.5 Million in DVS Intelestream, LLC.","raised_amount":28500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"DVS Intelestream","permalink":"dvs-intelestream","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0008/1837/81837v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0008/1837/81837v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[319,53],"assets/images/resized/0008/1837/81837v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.networkhardware.com/News/View/7/","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":12000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Network Hardware Resale","permalink":"network-hardware-resale","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/6140/196140v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/6140/196140v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0019/6140/196140v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
