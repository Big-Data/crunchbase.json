We believe in using progressive models to take traditional sharing, bartering, lending, trading, renting, gifting, and swapping into the digital age—connecting people with what they need with less waste and overhead. By using new technologies and good interface design to network a large group of people, these projects pool the resources of many to benefit the individual and inspire creative, futurist thinking.We believe this is the way business will be conducted down the road.
