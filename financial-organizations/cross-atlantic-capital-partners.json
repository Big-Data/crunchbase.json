Raised in 1999, Cross Atlantic Technology Fund I is a $120 million fund and was followed-on in 2001 by an $88 million fund, Cross Atlantic Technology Fund II. Additionally, they manage $300 million in two co-investment funds for the Pennsylvania Public School Employees&#8217; Retirement System (PSERS). The first of these Co-Investment Funds, Co-Investment Fund 2000, is a $150 million fund and was followed on in 2005 by another $150 million fund, Co-Investment Fund II.</p>\n\n<p>Their primary investment focus is in the commercialization of patented or specialty know-how in early to mid-stage technology companies. Their funds&#8217; historic and expected returns place them in the top decile / quartile of comparable vintage venture capital funds. They have a strong track record in early to mid-stage technology investing as evidenced by having been the first institutional investor in 5 of the 6 best producing investments. Their Partners bring a deep operational experience to managing the firm, as well as to the portfolio companies they work with. 5 of the 7 Partners have held CEO and/or COO positions within the technology industry, and they are engaging and active investors through their involvement on portfolio companies&#8217; boards, committees, and in the recruitment of key management.</p>\n\n<p>As a stable and mature management team, no Partner has less than 5 years of experience within the firm, and the Managing Partner has more than 20 years of investment experience in the firm&#8217;s focus sectors, stage, and geography and has been a principal in 13 IPOs. As a collective group, the management team leads a focused investment thesis by investing in companies holding patentable technologies or specialty know-how, targeting large market opportunities, and possessing quality management teams. They have a strong, proprietary deal flow derived by our network, their co-investor network, repeat entrepreneurs and CEO&#8217;s, as well as their established relationships with Silicon Valley Bank, the National Venture Capital Association, the Mid Atlantic Capital Alliance, and the New Jersey Technology Council.</p>\n\n<p>They maintain offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania, Dublin, Ireland and Edinburgh, Scotland.   From these offices, the firm targets and matures its investments in innovative technology companies in these countries. Given their activity in these countries and their engaged involvement in their portfolio companies, they specialize in allying the interests of our portfolio companies with their extensive Cross Atlantic network on both sides of the Atlantic, such as with potential customers, strategic partners, technology alliances, human capital, and capital markets.
