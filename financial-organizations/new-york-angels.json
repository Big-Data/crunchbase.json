The group meets monthly to screen and present early stage technology companies, and its members have invested over $42 million since 2002 into over 65 ventures.</p>\n\n<p>Among the NYA membership are nationally known angel investors including Esther Dyson,  Gideon Gartner, and David S. Rose; and venture capitalists including Alan Patricof, Josh Kopelman, Howard Morgan and Stuart Ellman. The group has a full-time staff, reporting to a seven person Board of Directors chaired by David S. Rose.</p>\n\n<p>New York Angels concentrates on technology-related, early stage investments in the range of $250,000 - $750,000, although it has led deals as large as $2 million. It receives 300-400 financing applications annually, from which it selects 10-15 companies each month for screening, of which typically three are invited to present to the group. In 2008, NYA made 22 investments (12 new, 9 follow-on). Since its founding New York Angels has led or participated in investments in 65 companies.</p>\n\n<p>The group is considered a leader in the growing field of organized angel investing. It was the first member of the national Angel Capital Association, hosted the ACA Summit conference in 2006, and was the initial test group for the now-standard Angelsoft funding platform.</p>\n\n<p>Membership as an investor in New York Angels is by invitation only, and members are required to commit to investing at least $50,000 annually in early stage technology deals, in addition to the group&#8217;s $3,500 annual membership dues.</p>\n\n<p>Requests for funding for entrepenurial ventures may be self-submitted through the group&#8217;s web site or through the Angelsoft platform. New York Angels charges no fees to entrepreneurs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/8336/98336v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0009/8336/98336v4-max-250x250.png"],[[358,81],"assets/images/resized/0009/8336/98336v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Main
