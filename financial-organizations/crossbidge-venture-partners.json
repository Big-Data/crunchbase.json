Over one-half of the investments made by the Fund Managers resulted in an IPO because of the excellent deal flow generated from their co-investment partners (leading U.S. venture capital firms) and their network of contacts in Asia and the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The Funds focus is on early to late stage investments in U.S. companies and in their subsidiaries located in Asia.  Targeted industries include communications, software, Internet, service, and semiconductors.\nThe CrossBridgeAdvantage is a hands-on approach that offers portfolio companies both timely and strategic access to the world&#8217;s second largest market. Management consists of former senior partners at Silicon Valley Bank, JAFCO, and Techno-Venture in Tokyo who have extensive experience in venture capital investing in the United States and Asia.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3234/23234v1-max-150x150.png"],[[108,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3234/23234v1-max-250x250.png"],[[108,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3234/23234v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Bruno","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Herman","last_name":"A.
