Acquire existing positions from financial institutions, corporations, private equity and venture capital managers, as well as individual investors.</p>\n\n<p>Jolimont Capital helps existing investors liquidate holdings that might otherwise be difficult to sell, allowing them to refocus their resources into new areas, provide distributions to LPs, or use the proceeds for follow-on investments into other businesses. Jolimont acquires holdings in single companies or portfolios of businesses, with a focus on Australian or New Zealand companies currently in or about to enter a rapid phase of growth. Single company transaction values can range from $1 million to $30 million.</p>\n\n<p>Jolimont&#8217;s approach starts with obtaining a thorough understanding of what the selling parties are hoping to achieve from the transaction. Often this can be more than financial, such as a desire to see the underlying investee companies succeed through the provision of additional capital and guidance from Jolimont. By understanding the seller&#8217;s financial and other drivers, a mutually beneficial and flexible deal structure can be negotiated. In understanding the motives of the selling party we also recognise that discretion and speed are important factors in any deal. Through our experience in successfully executing a number of secondaries transactions we have the ability to execute complex deals within a short timeframe.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0004/5959/45959v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/5959/45959v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[179,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/5959/45959v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Level 1, 133 Flinders Lane","address2":"","zip_code":"3000","city":"Melbourne, Victoria","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Gillies","permalink":"charles-gillies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5960/45960v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5960/45960v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5960/45960v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"Engelhard","permalink":"teresa-engelhard","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5962/45962v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5962/45962v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5962/45962v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Lex","last_name":"McArthur","permalink":"lex-mcarthur","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5961/45961v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5961/45961v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[102,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/5961/45961v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.rio-inc.com/06/press/press041508.html","source_description":"Redfern Integrated Optics, Inc.
