NIPR developed and implemented the Producer Database (PDB) and the NIPR Gateway. NIPR is governed by a 13 member board of directors, with 6 members representing the NAIC, 6 industry trade association representatives, including 3 producer trades and the CEO of the NAIC as an ex-offcio voting board member.</p>\n\n<p>The PDB is an electronic database consisting of information relating to insurance agents and brokers (producers). The PDB links participating state regulatory licensing systems into one common repository of producer information. The PDB also includes data from the Regulatory Information Retrieval System (RIRS) to provide a more comprehensive producer profile. The key benefits of PDB are:</p>\n\n<p>Increased productivity, less cost\nReduction or elimination of paper\nReal time information\nNational verification of license and status\nWeb based access\nSingle source of data vs. multiple web sites\nThe NIPR Gateway is a communication network that links state insurance regulators with the entities they regulate to facilitate the electronic exchange of producer information. Data standards have been developed for the exchange of license application, license renewal, appointment and termination information. All data flowing over the NIPR Gateway will conform to these standards. The key benefits of NIPR Gateway are:</p>\n\n<p>Reduction or elimination of paperwork and data entry\nUses national standards regarding electronic transmission of licensing data\nFaster turnaround time, including real time in certain states</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0007/2984/72984v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0007/2984/72984v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[264,106],"assets/images/resized/0007/2984/72984v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"550 W. 7th Ave., Ste. 1560","address2":"","zip_code":"99501-3567","city":"Anchorage","state_code":"AK","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VicePresident","person":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"Anderson","permalink":"william-anderson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"Hall","permalink":"linda-hall","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.audinate.com/news/AFR_Article_23April08-2.pdf","source_description":"Audinate's $4m to fund US expansion","raised_amount":3710000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":10,"company":{"name":"Audinate","permalink":"audinate","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/4778/44778v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[148,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/4778/44778v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[148,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/4778/44778v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.monitoringdivision.com/images/pdf/mdi_pr_funding(final3-sd)290208.pdf","source_description":"Monitoring Division, Inc.
