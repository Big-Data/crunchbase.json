In this effort Bayern Kapital usually acts as co-investor in cooperation with a lead investor. The &#8220;Bayern Kapital model&#8221; is unique in Germany. Bayern Kapital has now developed into an essential location factor and driver of private financing in Bavaria.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure continued implementation of innovation and growth in future, Bayern Kapital joined forces with the LfA Foerderbank and tbg-Technologie-Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft mbH (now KfW â€“ a bank sponsored by the German government), to create Seedfonds Bayern in 2003 with a volume of 22 million Euro for financing startups in the medical technology, environmental technology and information / communication / software sectors. The investments are up to 250k Euro per company or in cooperation model with the federal HTGF (High Tech GrÃ¼nderfonds) up to 600k Euro, usually in form of a combination of equity and subordinated loan or a silent partnership.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/6381/46381v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/6381/46381v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/6381/46381v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"LÃ¤ndgasse
