They seek opportunities to bridge technology gaps, explore and create new markets, and build global companies that are both innovative and profitable. They mitigate risk through a due diligence process that includes in-depth analysis of the technical, business, financial, and management capabilities of each start-up.</p>\n\n<p>With long-established connections in Ottawa and Montreal, Skypoint is ideally positioned to capture market-shaping opportunities in this eastern Canadian hotbed for communications. Skypoint may invest outside its geographical focus when the technology is compelling and where they can use our industry connections and locally based investment partners to enhance the company&#8217;s value.</p>\n\n<p>Because high-impact innovation and profitable early-stage investment rarely occur at random, Skypoint takes a carefully considered mentoring approach that both nurtures portfolio companies and significantly mitigates risk.  By applying their wealth of experience in this area, Skypoint accelerates the company&#8217;s growth and significantly contributes to the ultimate realization of value.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/0378/30378v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[149,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/0378/30378v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[149,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/0378/30378v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Canada
