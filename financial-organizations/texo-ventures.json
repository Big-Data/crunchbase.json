TEXO does exactly that, making early-stage investments in healthcare companies and then working in collaboration with founding entrepreneurs to build value. TEXO believes that the first stages of commercialization are critical to a company&#8217;s long-term success and its team understands the importance of making and supporting smart decisions from the beginning. </p>\n\n<p>TEXO is committed to early-stage investments in compelling healthcare companies. TEXO looks to partner with passionate entrepreneurs dedicated to advancing the art, science, and business of healthcare. Ideal ventures have leadership teams with a strong history of innovation, research, and business success. The team and the &#8220;idea&#8221; must be committed to improving the way healthcare is delivered. </p>\n\n<p>TEXO looks to invest across the following sectors: </p>\n\n<p>• Health IT\n• Technology-enabled Services\n• Home Healthcare\n• Managed Care\n• Chronic Disease Management\n• Medical Devices\n• Functional Diagnostics and Imaging\n• Personalized Medicine</p>\n\n<p>TEXO has a particular interest in the convergence of healthcare services and health IT.</p>\n\n<p>The looming U.S. healthcare reform will create a myriad of opportunities for entrepreneurs that deliver products and services that improve the way doctors (and the healthcare system) help patients. TEXO Ventures is excited about the unprecedented prospects for the next 10-15 years to invest in meaningful companies that are changing the face of healthcare.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0011/5041/115041v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,112],"assets/images/resized/0011/5041/115041v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,202],"assets/images/resized/0011/5041/115041v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"TEXO Ventures","address1":"6034 W Courtyard","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"78730","city":"Austin","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Sanger, MD","permalink":"philip-sanger-md","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Randall","last_name":"Crowder","permalink":"randall-crowder","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operating Partner","person":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Hurd, MD","permalink":"stephen-hurd-md","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jerry","last_name":"DeVries","permalink":"jerry-devries","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","person":{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Salvo","permalink":"vincent-salvo","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Communications Manager","person":{"first_name":"Meredith","last_name":"Sanger","permalink":"meredith-sanger","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"TEXO Ventures invests $900,000 in Wenzel Spine, an Austin-based medical device company developing innovative stand-alone solutions to stabilizing the spine.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":21,"source_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/02/22/story4.html?b=1266814800%255E2908061","source_text":null,"source_description":"TEXO Ventures Half Angel Funding, Half VC","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"TEXO Ventures","permalink":"texo-ventures"}},{"description":"TEXO Ventures leads a $750,000 investment in Waldo Health, an Austin-based telehealth company commercializing an innovative platform for remote patient monitoring.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":24,"source_url":"http://dallas.citybizlist.com/16/2010/6/24/Texo-VenturesBacked-Waldo-Networks-Raises-Most-of-1M-Offering--cbl.aspx","source_text":null,"source_description":"TEXO Ventures Leads Investment in Waldo Health","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"TEXO Ventures","permalink":"texo-ventures"}},{"description":"TEXO Ventures leads $2M investment in Ortho Kinematics, an Austin-based medical diagnostics company that has developed an automated functional diagnostic test for the spine that uses fluoroscopy to capture the spine in motion, producing patient-specific g","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":8,"source_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2010/12/08/ortho-kinematics-raises-2m-of-51m.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"TEXO Ventures Leads Investment in Ortho Kinematics","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"TEXO Ventures","permalink":"texo-ventures"}},{"description":"Precedent Health, Inc. was founded by industry veterans with a passion to help physicians, hospitals and payers provide high quality patient care in a cost-effective manner.
