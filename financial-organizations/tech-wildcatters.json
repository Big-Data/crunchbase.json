Our 12-week accelerator “bootcamp” has been rated as a Top 10 Accelerator/Incubator by Forbes.\nWe’re very selective – each year we expect hundreds of companies to apply to the program and 8-10 of them will be invited to Dallas for each class. The companies get up to $25,000 in seed funding, intensive top-notch mentorship, and the opportunity to pitch to angel investors, venture capitalists and corporate development teams at our end of program “Pitch Day”.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/9745/79745v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/9745/79745v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,216],"assets/images/resized/0007/9745/79745v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Tech Church","address1":"2700 Fairmount","address2":"","zip_code":"75201","city":"Dallas","state_code":"TX","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Gabriella","last_name":"Draney","permalink":"gabriella-draney","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/1658/121658v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/1658/121658v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[375,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/1658/121658v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Brad","last_name":"Taylor","permalink":"brad-taylor-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2338/182338v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/2338/182338v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/2338/182338v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Program Manager","person":{"first_name":"Stewart","last_name":"Youngblood","permalink":"stewart-youngblood","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Jon","last_name":"Feld","permalink":"jon-feld","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Reed","permalink":"john-reed","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operations Manager","person":{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Mendoza","permalink":"joseph-mendoza","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/DN-techwildcatters_06bus.ART.State.Edition1.4435b40.html","source_description":"A new Dallas incubator, Tech Wildcatters, begins program with five start-ups","raised_amount":20000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"CollegeJobConnect","permalink":"collegejobconnect","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0010/2378/102378v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0010/2378/102378v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,81],"assets/images/resized/0010/2378/102378v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://angel.co/techwildcatters-dallas#activity","source_description":"AngelList","raised_amount":65000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"Qwiqq","permalink":"qwiqq","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/6598/136598v12-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/6598/136598v12-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/6598/136598v12-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://angel.co/atticous/activity/6JbUH","source_description":"AngelList","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Atticous","permalink":"atticous","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0018/3283/183283v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,99],"assets/images/resized/0018/3283/183283v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,178],"assets/images/resized/0018/3283/183283v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techwildcatters.com/companies/","source_description":"Tech Wildcatters Companies","raised_amount":25000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"Mineful","permalink":"mineful","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0014/6506/146506v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0014/6506/146506v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[384,100],"assets/images/resized/0014/6506/146506v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Glass","permalink":"glass","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0022/1328/221328v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0022/1328/221328v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,149],"assets/images/resized/0022/1328/221328v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
