It was set-up in late 2009 by Dr. Lee Kai-Fu, in conjunction with Innovation Works Development Fund (IWDF), IW&#8217;s captive early stage venture capital fund. IW has only one purpose in mind: to invest in the most promising technology teams in China, in the booming consumer internet, mobile internet and cloud computing sectors. The majority of IW&#8217;s portfolio companies are incubated in-house, led by some of the most talented young entrepreneurs in China. As a result, IWDF differs from its peers by being a captive, very focused and truly early stage fund.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/6271/66271v5-max-150x150.png"],[[220,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6271/66271v5-max-250x250.png"],[[220,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6271/66271v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Beijing Headquarters","address1":"Dinghao Tower A, 10th Floor","address2":"#3 Haidian Street","zip_code":"100080","city":"Beijing","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager - Incubation Programs","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Evdemon","permalink":"chris-evdemon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/6269/66269v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[118,163],"assets/images/resized/0006/6269/66269v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[118,163],"assets/images/resized/0006/6269/66269v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Chris Evdemon</p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Team Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Mickey","last_name":"Du","permalink":"mickey-du","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Associate","person":{"first_name":"Jixin","last_name":"Huang","permalink":"jixin-huang","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Innovation Works invested in Umeng (Series A)","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Innovation Works (China)","permalink":"innovation-works-china"}},{"description":"Innovation Works invested in Ascending Cloud (http://www.crunchbase.com/company/wandoujjia).
