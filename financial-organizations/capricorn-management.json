Some transactions may require in excess of $100 million of co-invested funds.  Capricorn expects to capitalize on its investors&#8217; expertise and &#8220;hands on&#8221; experience in turnarounds and other special investment situations by seeking to invest in under-performing companies, generally on a negotiated, exclusive basis.  Together with portfolio company management teams.  Capricorn will seek to improve short-term performance through financial and operational restructuring, and to create long-term value through internal growth and acquisitions.  The investments may involve acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, spin-offs or other financial approaches. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0002/9698/29698v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9698/29698v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[385,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/9698/29698v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Capricom Management, G.P.","address1":"30 Elm Road","address2":"","zip_code":"06830","city":"Greenwich","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":41.026853,"longitude":-73.624475}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"S.
