This partnership focuses on opportunities at the earliest stages of their development, even if the business plan hasnâ€™t been fully built out. Sure, thereâ€™s a certain amount of ambiguity at this stage, but it also the point at which the right experience generates the highest return. And the Principals at Verge know a little something about that.</p>\n\n<p>The opportunities in New Mexico are just below the surface and Verge knows exactly where to find them. The Principals of this partnership have a combined 43 years of experience investing in and working with entrepreneurial companies in New Mexico. Their history is working in the labs, the universities and successful venture capital firms. They live here, they work here and they know how to get things done here.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/9829/29829v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/9829/29829v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/9829/29829v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"317 Commercial St. NE","address2":"","zip_code":" 87102","city":"Albuquerque","state_code":"NM","country_code":"USA","latitude":35.086388,"longitude":-106.646185}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partners","person":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"F.
