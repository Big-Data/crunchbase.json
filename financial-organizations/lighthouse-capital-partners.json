Our founders, experienced financial investors, started the firm because they were frustrated by the fact that promising start-ups often struggled or failed because of the constraints of equity and bank financing. They believed that companies that have proven their business case to top venture capital firms should be able to use debt responsibly to leverage their equity and to extend the operating runway. Lighthouse was launched to provide this flexible, entrepreneurial financing to worthy start-ups.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lcpartners.com/about.htm\" title=\"Source\"
