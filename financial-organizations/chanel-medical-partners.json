This stage of financing has historically\nrepresented a narrow channel or bottleneck for emerging growth companies -\nthe point in their development between the substantial capital provided by\nearlier stage venture capital investors and that provided by institutions\nfocused primarily on public companies. The firm has a demonstrated record\nof success in not only providing capital, but in enabling and ensuring the\ncommercial success of its portfolio companies.
