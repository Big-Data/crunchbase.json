The focus of the investment, which concentrates on the German-speaking countries (D / A / CH), lies in the areas of photonics and sensor systems which offer promising prospects for the future. Investors in the DEWB share gain access to the significant potential for added value offered by these key technologies of the 21st Century: Discover the light.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1997 we have invested over 350 million Euros in 55 companies and realized more than 420 million Euros through 36 exits, eight of which were IPOs. DEWBâ€™s current investment portfolio covers 11 companies with a total value of more than 40 million Euros from the areas of photonics and sensor systems, as well as biotechnology and IT.\nFocus on photonics - key industry of the 21st century. Photonics and sensor systems are amongst the most promising growth areas in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p>Optical technologies utilise light (photons) as a â€œtoolâ€, information or energy medium. They cover the full range of technologies for light</p>\n\n<p>â–ª generation, e.g. lasers, bulbs,\nâ–ª manipulation, e.g. lenses, gratings, \nâ–ª transfer, e.g. optical fibre,\nâ–ª conversion, e.g. solar cells, LED,\nâ–ª storage, e.g. CD, DVD, holograms,\nâ–ª visualization, e.g. displays and \nâ–ª exploitation, e.g. water sterilization using UV rays.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of their superior physical properties, optical processes and technologies are increasingly replacing the previously established processes and applications. Examples of this are the use of lasers in material processing, new display technologies and optical storage media. As cross sectional technologies, optical technologies provide a wide range of industries with various applications. This creates a reduced dependency upon the cycles of individual sectors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/4291/44291v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[105,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/4291/44291v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[105,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/4291/44291v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Leutragraben 1","address2":"","zip_code":"07743","city":" Jena","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":50.9287055,"longitude":11.5836161}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Member of the Management Board","person":{"first_name":"Bertram","last_name":"KÃ¶hler","permalink":"bertram-khler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/4293/44293v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[95,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/4293/44293v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[95,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/4293/44293v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Member of the Management Board","person":{"first_name":"Falk","last_name":"Nuber","permalink":"falk-nuber","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/4294/44294v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[95,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/4294/44294v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[95,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/4294/44294v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.nanotron.com/EN/NE_news-2008-04-24-PR1.php","source_description":"Nanotron Secures Additional Capital with New Investor","raised_amount":17430000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"Nanotron Technologies","permalink":"nanotron-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/3791/43791v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0004/3791/43791v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[268,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/3791/43791v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"e","source_url":"http://www.sloning.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=22","source_description":"Sloning BioTechnology GmbH Raised â‚¬ 4.7m in a First Closing of a Series E Equity Financing Round","raised_amount":4700000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"Sloning BioTechnology","permalink":"sloning-biotechnology","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0008/0493/80493v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0008/0493/80493v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,79],"assets/images/resized/0008/0493/80493v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
