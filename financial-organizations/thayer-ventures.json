This industry, which represents over $10 trillion in annual global economic activity, is thriving with entrepreneurial activity due to the disruptive changes within the sector which began over a decade ago. Recent consumer trends have accelerated this disruption for operators across the hospitality and travel world, creating unprecedented opportunities for technology providers to make significant inroads into what was previously a closed market. Additionally, hospitality suppliers are dealing with massive shifts in travel planning, organizing and booking driven by the Internet and social media platforms. As a result, the hospitality industry is being forced to rapidly deploy new technologies in order to exploit the opportunities created by this shifting consumer behavior. The combination of these factors has created a unique environment for innovative technology providers to make significant inroads into this massive, growing, and evolving marketplace.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0021/5399/215399v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0021/5399/215399v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[258,119],"assets/images/resized/0021/5399/215399v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"220 Montgomery Street Suite 417","address2":"","zip_code":"94104","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/10/switchfly-raises-2-8m-completes-series-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Switchfly Raises $2.8M; Completes Series C Funding","raised_amount":2800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":12,"company":{"name":"Switchfly","permalink":"switchfly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,141],"assets/images/resized/0017/3314/173314v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,235],"assets/images/resized/0017/3314/173314v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,424],"assets/images/resized/0017/3314/173314v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://blog.tourwrist.com/tourwrist-receives-1-25-million-to-accelerate-growth/","source_description":"Travel Tech Investors General Catalyst Partners and Thayer Ventures Join See Round","raised_amount":1250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"TourWrist","permalink":"tour-wrist-2","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0014/3807/143807v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0014/3807/143807v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,130],"assets/images/resized/0014/3807/143807v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
