SV Angel provides capital investments to early stage companies focused on the Internet, e-commerce, and information technology markets. </p>\n\n<p>SV Angel is a venture fund which has raised investment from external investors or limited partners in industry parlance. In April 2010, the fund announced its size of $20 million. Per the firm, SV Angel initially expected to raise a $10 million fund but was oversubscribed and hence the amount was raised to $20 million. Since then, the fund has grown to be approximately twice that size.</p>\n\n<p>SV Angel primarily invests relatively small amounts in early stage companies. The firm is said to see virtually all &#8220;interesting&#8221; deals in the web and mobile
