Our partners include successful serial entrepreneurs and experienced corporate managers, who may serve as the interim CEOs or operating chairmen of a number of the companies we form.</p>\n\n<p>While they expect to be co-founders of companies in some circumstances, ESVC are also interested in hearing from entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who have already formed or plan to form new ventures in the life sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Attractive markets, solid patent protection and freedom to operate, defensible market position, and a world class management team are elements ultimately critical for success.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0004/9931/49931v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/9931/49931v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[256,39],"assets/images/resized/0004/9931/49931v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Elm
