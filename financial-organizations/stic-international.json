The firm was founded in 1999 and currently manages more than USD1.2 billion. They have over 45 dedicated investment professionals in regional offices around the world in Seoul, Busan, Taipei, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Silicon Valley and soon to be Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>STIC started as a venture capitalist fund in partnership with South Koreaâ€™s Ministry of Information &amp; Communication (â€œMICâ€). Their long-term experience gave us the insight and patience to become a recognized leader in technology investments across a broad spectrum of technologies including mobile telecommunications, next-generation networks, biotechnology and robotics. STIC is also the leading and most experienced Korean private equity group specializing in mid-cap private equity buyouts and secondary market transactions. With their breadth of talent, intensive research and risk-averse approach they creatively seek out new opportunities that allow us to remain a leader in alternative investments. STIC is the first South Korean private equity company to manage Shariah compliant funds.</p>\n\n<p>STICâ€™s edge is its ability to utilize and leverage local insight from its offices by collaborating with its investment professionals around the globe in all aspects of the investment process from deal sourcing, due diligence and monitoring. As a result, creating more investment opportunities, deeper level of regional expertise and successful exits that translate into return for their investors.</p>\n\n<p>Since inception, the firm has invested in more than 282 portfolio companies diversified across the entire spectrum of technologies, and has successfully achieved 48 IPOâ€™s and 147 M&amp;Aâ€™s and trade sales including partial exits (as of June 2008).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0003/0870/30870v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/0870/30870v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,35],"assets/images/resized/0003/0870/30870v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"228 Hamilton Ave.","address2":"Suite 210","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.4440981,"longitude":-122.1612868},{"description":"","address1":"MSA Building, 10-12 Floors","address2":"No.891-43 Daechi-Dong Kangnam-Gu","zip_code":"135-840","city":"Seoul ","state_code":null,"country_code":"KOR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Yong","last_name":"Hwan Do","permalink":"yong-hwan-do","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Managing Partner","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"J.G.
