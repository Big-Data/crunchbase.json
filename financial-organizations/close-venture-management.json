In the twelve years since the first fund was launched, a dividend has been paid by every fund, every year, totalling some Â£81 million - more than any other VCT manager.

They think it is appropriate that a business investing in owner-managed companies is itself owner-managed. They look to invest Â£1-10 million in a wide range of growing businesses, from technology orientated companies to service and asset-based
