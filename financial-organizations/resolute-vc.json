Very soon after our first meeting, we will either pass or articulate a discrete roadmap to a decision.\nWe will invest as little as $50k and as much as $750k in a company’s initial financing.\nWe prefer being a lead investor and guiding our entrepreneurs to the key milestones for a successful venture round.   We dislike “headless” seed rounds that lack a lead investor.\nPost investment we immediately focus on ensuring these milestones are clearly defined, and work to help our entrepreneurs achieve them.
