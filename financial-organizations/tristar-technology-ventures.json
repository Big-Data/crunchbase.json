The TriStar strategy is to tap into the research base at institutions in Tennessee and beyond in order to start new companies or invest in existing companies located in Tennessee. We will also consider investments in existing companies that do not have a direct tie to a research institution, but otherwise meet our investment criteria.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0015/8066/158066v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0015/8066/158066v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0015/8066/158066v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Nashville","address1":"3401 West End","address2":"","zip_code":"37203","city":"Nashville","state_code":"TN","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Rand","permalink":"christopher-rand","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Jacobson","permalink":"harry-jacobson","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Laden","permalink":"brian-laden","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Analyst","person":{"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"McWilliams","permalink":"lisa-mcwilliams","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
