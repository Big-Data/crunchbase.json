They back exceptional teams who not only have the talent to identify and execute on exciting opportunities but can also pull off the mid-course corrections that are inevitably required in an early stage company. They focus on executive leadership, execution ability and domain expertise in our assessment of teams.</p>\n\n<p>Silverton Partners&#8217; investment approach centers on putting the entrepreneur first. They are typically the â€œgo toâ€ guy in the investment syndicate and usually hear the bad news first. They are committed to putting a fair deal on the table, being unusually responsive to their entrepreneursâ€™ needs and putting the companyâ€™s interests ahead of their own. They believe in communication that is open, honest and direct.</p>\n\n<p>They are almost always the first institutional investor in a company and the lead investor if there is a syndicate of investors. They invest in pure start-ups, in boot-strapped companies that are ready for expansion capital (or founder liquidity), and in angel-backed companies which seek institutional backing. They typically invest up to $3 million in an initial financing, with the expectation that they will double that commitment over the life of the company.</p>\n\n<p>They invest primarily in Austin-based companies. Although they will look at other Texas-based opportunities on an exception basis, they have found that they do best when they can be close to their companies. Their company interactions are highly relationship driven and they find it difficult to maintain this dynamic if distance prevents the casual and impromptu encounters that they find so valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Silverton Partners is broadly focused on information technology. Within this space, they tend to invest in market opportunities where Austin has world class talent. Their companies can be either technology driven or focused on opportunities where technology can be used to build significant proprietary barriers over time.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/0303/30303v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0003/0303/30303v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[368,123],"assets/images/resized/0003/0303/30303v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Austin
