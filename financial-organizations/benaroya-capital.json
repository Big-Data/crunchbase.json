The Benaroyas&#8217; lead gift enabled construction to begin for the new Seattle Symphony Hall. The world-class venue, Benaroya Hall, opened its doors in 1998. In 1999, Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle completed construction of its state-of-the-art Benaroya Research Institute, a facility dedicated to solving the mysteries of diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. The Benaroyas also support numerous other civic, medical, and charitable organizations.</p>\n\n<p>In 1995, The Benaroya Company reentered the Northwest real estate scene. Today, our office, data center, retail, and industrial holdings extend from the Puget Sound region to the broader Pacific Northwest.</p>\n\n<p>Under the leadership of Larry Benaroya, The Benaroya Company employs a staff of 30, including professionals experienced in the acquisition, development, management, and leasing of quality commercial real estate. Our ability to move quickly, to anticipate the changing needs of our tenants, and to provide excellent quality and value has made The Benaroya Company a leader in commercial real estate throughout the Pacific Northwest.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0010/0396/100396v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,49],"assets/images/resized/0010/0396/100396v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,49],"assets/images/resized/0010/0396/100396v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"3600 136th Place SE","address2":"Suite 250","zip_code":"98006","city":"Bellevue","state_code":"WA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2009/12/swype_swipes_new_venture_round.html","source_description":"Swype swipes new venture round.","raised_amount":5600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":15,"company":{"name":"Swype","permalink":"swype","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/4795/24795v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/4795/24795v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/4795/24795v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2008/07/29/cequint-inc-obtains-7100000-series-b-financing-round/","source_description":"Cequint, Inc.
