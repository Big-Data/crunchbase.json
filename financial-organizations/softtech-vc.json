SoftTech VC funds are backed by a mix of institutional and private investors. SoftTech has consistently invested in 20+ new opportunities a year in consumer Internet companies, including next gen commerce, mobile and SaaS.</p>\n\n<p>Founder and managing partner Jeff Clavier launched SoftTech VC in 2004, making the original 20+ investments (our non-traditional ‘Fund I’) as a business angel, investing his own capital, time and experience. As one of the original ‘super angels’ in the valley, Jeff developed SoftTech VC’s implementation of the micro-vc concept which has become so popular.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, the firm launched SoftTech VC II, a $15M seed fund focusing on the consumer Internet space, aiming at investing in 60+ companies over 3 years. In 2011, $55M SoftTech VC III successor fund made its debut. Firm principals have been involved in over 100 startups as investors, advisors or founders. SoftTech VC has seen 20+ exits, and our companies have raised over $800M in follow-on financing. Today, SoftTech VC is among the most active investors in early stage consumer Internet and mobile startups.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0001/5954/15954v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/5954/15954v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,143],"assets/images/resized/0001/5954/15954v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"395
