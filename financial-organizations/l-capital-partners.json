This mission is clearly reflected in their portfolio of healthcare, technology and energy &amp; environment companies with their unique value propositions. To help these companies realize the promise of transformational change they are a committed, multi-round investor that supports each company with a team of partners, principals and associates who have deep industry expertise and financial acumen.</p>\n\n<p>In the healthcare sector, they target investments in the areas of biopharmaceuticals and medical devices, and are particularly interested in companies in which the areas of drugs and devices intersect. In the technology sector, they primarily target companies in security/defense (homeland security) and information technology.
