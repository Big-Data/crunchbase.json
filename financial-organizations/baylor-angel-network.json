After a rigorous interview process, BAN offers internships to top senior business school students to work as analysts and carry on the day-to-day operations of the network.  These highly inspired and talented analysts receive a real-life education on the inner workings of angel investing.  The student analysts and daily operations are coordinated by staff member Kevin Castello, Associate Director of BAN, and a Baylor MBA graduate.  Kevin and the student analysts are under the faculty supervision of Dr. Bill Petty who serves as the Executive Director of BAN.  The network is under the administrative authority of its Board of Advisors as well as the Hankamer School of Business and Dean Terry Maness.  BANâ€™s angels are successful business men and women who desire to invest in the education of students, the furtherance of entrepreneurial ideas by the Baylor family, and the Hankamer School of Business.  Since each angel agrees to contribute a portion of their profits, BAN provides a long-term revenue source for the Hankamer School of Business and Baylor University.</p>\n\n<p>In this edition of the Business Review, CJ Jackson interviews the Director of the Baylor Angel Network, Pat Horner, as he provides advice for entrepreneurs seeking funding.</p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/02/15/daily50.html","source_description":"MyEdu $3.2MM Series A Round from Several Angel Investors","raised_amount":3200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"MyEdu","permalink":"myedu","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0004/2334/42334v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[162,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/2334/42334v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[162,47],"assets/images/resized/0004/2334/42334v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/targeting-power-moms-volunteerspot-secures-1-5m-in-series-a-from-ff-venture-capital-and-more/","source_description":"Targeting Power Moms, VolunteerSpot Secures $1.5M In Series A From ff Venture Capital And More","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":27,"company":{"name":"VolunteerSpot","permalink":"volunteerspot","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0019/7761/197761v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0019/7761/197761v1-max-250x250.png"],[[292,91],"assets/images/resized/0019/7761/197761v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
