It&#8217;s primary purpose is to serve as his investment vehicle. </p>\n\n<p>Kevin brings a unique combination of assets to a startup company, including 25 years in the industry, and sat on four public boards, in addition to numerous private company boards. Kevin is perhaps best known as co-founder &amp; CEO of Doubleclick.</p>\n\n<p>His investing approach is simple.  Find companies that fill a fundamental consumer or business need in the most efficient way.  Cool technology just doesn&#8217;t cut it - products must solve a real problem.  He&#8217;s looking for management teams that are smart, competitive and aggressive.  He&#8217;s not looking for people that want to make a quick buck or to simply get rich - he emphasizes investing in people that love what they do.  </p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"O'Connor","permalink":"kevin-oconnor","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0008/0156/80156v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/0156/80156v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,300],"assets/images/resized/0008/0156/80156v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","person":{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"O'Connor","permalink":"kevin-oconner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7863/147863v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/7863/147863v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/7863/147863v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.socaltech.com/campus_explorer_raises_series_a/s-0010614.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Campus Explorer","permalink":"campus-explorer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0001/9241/19241v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/9241/19241v1-max-250x250.png"],[[330,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/9241/19241v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
