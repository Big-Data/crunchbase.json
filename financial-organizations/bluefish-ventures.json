Bluefish targets markets with significant growth potential and specifically companies involved in, but not limited to, Internet infrastructure, enterprise software, wireless applications and power technology. Key criteria when making an investment decision include the strength of the company&#8217;s management team, the potential size of the company&#8217;s target market and the competitive advantages the company has versus other industry participants.</p>\n\n<p>Bluefish believes in a hands-on, high-energy approach to developing its portfolio companies, but understands that too much involvement may stifle a company&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit. Therefore, rather than participate in the day-to-day operations of its portfolio companies, Bluefish prefers to act as an ongoing advisor by providing financial, operational and strategic guidance, more in line with its partners&#8217; backgrounds in investment banking and merger advisory. Beyond providing guidance, Bluefish mines its personal and professional contacts for promising leads to provide its portfolio companies access to potential customers, employees, strategic partners and financing sources. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0006/1948/61948v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[203,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/1948/61948v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[203,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/1948/61948v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"e","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/06/19/livevox-raises-71m-for-voice-portal/","source_description":"LiveVox raises $7.1M for voice â€œportalâ€","raised_amount":7100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":19,"company":{"name":"LiveVox","permalink":"livevox","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0003/2674/32674v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[213,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/2674/32674v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/2674/32674v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"f","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"LiveVox","permalink":"livevox","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0003/2674/32674v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[213,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/2674/32674v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/2674/32674v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bluefishventures.com/","title":""}]}
