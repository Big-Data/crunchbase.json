We continue to conduct our activities to direct and indirect investment, but now primarily for the ISP, we are the operator on the segment of unlisted businesses, with growth potential. Caisse des DÃ©pÃ´ts nevertheless wished to allocate CDC Entreprises an annual budget of 50 million euros to conduct, for its own account, an investment program in the direction of economic sectors or market segments that are not in ISP strategy. Remember also that CDC Entreprises manages funds open to third parties (State, EIF, EIB, BCCE &#8230;).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0010/0744/100744v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[163,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/0744/100744v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[163,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/0744/100744v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"137 University Street","address2":"","zip_code":"75007","city":"Paris","state_code":null,"country_code":"FRA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":13460000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":26,"company":{"name":"Alyotech","permalink":"alyotech","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/3836/53836v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/3836/53836v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/3836/53836v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"d","source_url":"http://www.cytheris.com/PDF/CYTHERIS_100607_Series%20D_EN.pdf","source_description":"Cytheris Closes â‚¬12 Million ($15 Million) Series D Financing","raised_amount":15000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":7,"company":{"name":"Cytheris","permalink":"cytheris","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0008/4401/84401v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0008/4401/84401v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[375,141],"assets/images/resized/0008/4401/84401v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":10980000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Scopelec","permalink":"scopelec","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/4035/94035v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0009/4035/94035v1-max-250x250.png"],[[264,60],"assets/images/resized/0009/4035/94035v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.alyotech.com/","source_description":"Pursuing Growth and a New â‚¬4 million Capital Increase","raised_amount":4000000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Alyotech","permalink":"alyotech","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/3836/53836v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[144,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/3836/53836v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[144,54],"assets/images/resized/0005/3836/53836v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":5330000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"TRSB Groupe","permalink":"trsb-groupe","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/04/sensorion-raises-e750k.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Sensorion Raises €750K","raised_amount":750000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":26,"company":{"name":"Sensorion","permalink":"sensorion","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0018/6411/186411v1-max-150x150.png"],[[211,70],"assets/images/resized/0018/6411/186411v1-max-250x250.png"],[[211,70],"assets/images/resized/0018/6411/186411v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":3930000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Bestofmedia Group","permalink":"bestofmedia-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/0270/20270v6-max-150x150.png"],[[124,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/0270/20270v6-max-250x250.png"],[[124,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/0270/20270v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
