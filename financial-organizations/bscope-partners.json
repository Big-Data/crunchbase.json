Their office has been tasked to provide intelligence on the business and investment landscape in China, and to source and monitor specific investment opportunities. bScope has also directly, on its own behalf, launched and invested in early stage ventures from which they collect first-hand operational data and insights. For projects they directly invest in they take a long-term approach in building companies instead of focusing on short-term financial returns. They furthermore operate a Venture Laboratory, which aims to research, create, participate in, and support grassroots initiatives in the field of sustainable and socially responsible development.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0008/6175/86175v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[162,112],"assets/images/resized/0008/6175/86175v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[162,112],"assets/images/resized/0008/6175/86175v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.gobivc.com/attachments/news/61_en.pdf","source_description":"LINGTU SECURES US$30 MILLION IN NEW FUNDING Gobi Partners Leads Oversubscribed Round","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"Beijing Lingtu Software","permalink":"beijing-lingtu-software","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0008/6168/86168v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[162,63],"assets/images/resized/0008/6168/86168v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[162,63],"assets/images/resized/0008/6168/86168v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
