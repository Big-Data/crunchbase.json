These companies are profitable or on the path to sustainable cash flow with $5 to $50 million in revenue. While Mercato generally invests in later financings as a minority shareholder, we are active participants in a company&#8217;s growth. Mercato investment candidates seek growth capital to fuel continued expansion through channel building, broader distribution, new product launches and acquisitions. Companies often seek partnership with Mercato Partners during the critical shift from direct to channel sales.  This transition from a direct sales model to selling products through hundreds of resellers, channel partners and distributors is a moment of significant revenue inflection. This inflection point is where Mercato Partners invests. Sales expansion is the priority and speed and efficiency are critical.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/5136/55136v1-max-150x150.png"],[[161,111],"assets/images/resized/0005/5136/55136v1-max-250x250.png"],[[161,111],"assets/images/resized/0005/5136/55136v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"6405 South 3000 East","address2":"","zip_code":"84121","city":"Salt Lake City","state_code":"UT","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.634468,"longitude":-111.804504}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Hall","permalink":"alan-hill","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal","person":{"first_name":"Ken","last_name":"Krull","permalink":"ken-krull","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Associate","person":{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"Grover","permalink":"joe-grover","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Warnock","permalink":"greg-warnock","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal","person":{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"DeRose","permalink":"aaron-derose","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Operations Manager","person":{"first_name":"Tara","last_name":"Rosander","permalink":"tara-rosander","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://green.venturebeat.com/2009/07/08/control4-plugs-into-the-smart-grid-with-new-173m/","source_description":"Control4 plugs into the smart grid with new $17.3M","raised_amount":17300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Control4","permalink":"control4","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0001/8092/18092v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/8092/18092v1-max-250x250.png"],[[251,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/8092/18092v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.pehub.com/36560/fusion-io-raises-475-million/","source_description":"Fusion-io Raises $47.5 Million","raised_amount":47500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":7,"company":{"name":"Fusion-io","permalink":"fusion-io","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/0916/40916v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,64],"assets/images/resized/0004/0916/40916v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[404,105],"assets/images/resized/0004/0916/40916v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/09/central-logic-raises-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Central Logic Raises Funding","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"Central Logic","permalink":"central-logic","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0021/1641/211641v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0021/1641/211641v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[252,81],"assets/images/resized/0021/1641/211641v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
