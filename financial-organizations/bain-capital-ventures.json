Technologies Announces Strategic Relationship with Bain Capital\r\nVentures","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"","source_text":"OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Nov. 12, 2008 â€“ Archer Technologies, a provider of enterprise governance, risk and compliance (GRC) solutions, today announced that the company has formed a strategic partnership with Bain Capital Ventures, which included a substantial investment of an undisclosed amount. As a strong and profitable leader in the enterprise GRC space, Archer will utilize growth capital from Bain to expand its sales team, increase its global presence and enhance its ability to deliver best-in-class solutions to more than six million licensed users worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPartnered with Bain Capital, Archer will continue to deliver out-of-the-box software solutions built on the flexible Archer SmartSuite Framework, providing the foundation for a successful enterprise GRC program for clients and partners within the financial services, telecommunications, retail, media, technology and healthcare industries, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Customers simply love Archer Technologies because it's the only solution that enables them to prove compliance rather than merely stipulate it. Archer's SmartSuite Framework reduces the costs of compliance and risk management by up to 90 percent,\" said Ben Nye, managing director for Bain Capital Ventures. \"Based on our extensive due diligence with many of their key clients, we found that Archer is an extremely well-positioned, well-managed company with the most innovative approach to software delivery that we have seen in the market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing a period of active pursuit from a number of growth capital firms and software giants, Archer elected to enter into a strategic relationship with Bain Capital Ventures, which took a minority stake in the company. As one of the most respected growth equity firms in the world, Bain Capital Ventures is the Boston-based venture capital group of Bain Capital, whose affiliates manage over $80 billion of assets. Bain Capital Ventures has extensive experience in helping companies achieve rapid growth and become long-term leaders in their markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"This is an exciting time for Archer as we closed our strongest third quarter to date and look to surpass that record in the fourth quarter. Coupled with our 96 percent customer renewals since inception, the growth we've seen this year has been the greatest in our company history,\" said Jon Darbyshire, Archer president and CEO. \"With a world-class partner in Bain Capital, we now have the opportunity to expand Archer's presence on a global scale, while maintaining our commitment to the success of our employees, whose talent and dedication to customer satisfaction have fueled our growth year after year.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAccording to Nye, \"We looked at several companies in the GRC market and selected Archer based on its industry reputation, history of success and strong validation from customers, partners and the analyst community. Bain Capital's investment will provide fuel to Archer's already significant growth.\"","source_description":"Archer Technologies Announces Strategic Relationship with Bain Capital Ventures","stoneable_type":"FinancialOrg","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Bain Capital Ventures","permalink":"bain-capital-ventures"}}],"providerships":[{"title":"","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Cooley ","permalink":"cooley-godward-kronish-llp","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0009/4482/94482v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0009/4482/94482v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[429,155],"assets/images/resized/0009/4482/94482v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"funds":[{"name":"Bain Capital Venture Fund 2012","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":30,"raised_amount":800000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","source_url":"https://www.fis.dowjones.com/article.aspx?ProductIDFromApplication=32&aid=DJFVW00020120130e81utt0v6&r=Rss&s=DJFVW","source_description":"Bain Capital Ventures Lowers Carry To Close Latest Fund At $600M "}],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://blip.tv/play/goRrgZaqcQI%2Em4v\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"370\" height=\"308\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed> ","description":"<p>This video was originally publised on <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2009/08/big-boston-vc-firm-sees-upside-in-midtail-online-video-content-.html\" title=\"Beet.TV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet.TV</a></p>"}],"external_links":[]}
