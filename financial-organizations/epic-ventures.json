Since inception, the Wasatch Team has invested in over 80 early-stage companies and delivered significant returns to investors.  Wasatch now manages four funds, equaling $170 million of capital under management.</p>\n\n<p>Wasatch focuses exclusively on working with driven entrepreneurs to build successful and lasting companies.  Given our early-stage focus, our preference is to work with companies in the western United States.</p>\n\n<p>The Wasatch Team works collaboratively on each investment we make.  We believe that what sets us apart as investors, partners, advisors and teammates, is the Network we bring to bear.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http://www.wasatchvc.com/\" title=\"Epic Ventures\"
