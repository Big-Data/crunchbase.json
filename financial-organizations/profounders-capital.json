Our investors and principals number some of the best-known players within the digital media space &#8211; people who have built some of Europe&#8217;s most successful companies.</p>\n\n<p>Our aim is to invest in and support new businesses with capital plus proactive advice and expertise in order to create long-term value and promote entrepreneurism. We believe that the combination of dynamic new entrepreneurs and PROfounders Capital&#8217;s principals&#8217; experience leads to mutual benefits, interesting long-term co-operation and a strong base for new ventures to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>Our focus is on capital efficient, early-stage companies operating in the digital media and technology space. We look for companies that have disciplined and innovative management and which address large potential markets, using technologies that are new or clearly differentiated from any incumbents to generate identifiable revenue streams that can be scaled.</p>\n\n<p>Typically our initial investment will be between Â£0.5m - Â£2.5m with the scope and intention to support future financing rounds where necessary and appropriate. Our principal geographical focus is on European-based
