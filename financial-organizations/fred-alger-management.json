Independence provides them with freedom to stick with what they know best - finding pure growth companies in all industries and all capitalization ranges no matter what outside market forces prevail. For more than 40 years, they&#8217;ve proven that stocks of rapidly growing companies can offer some of the best investment opportunities in the stock market over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>Institutional investors such as state and local governments, corporate pension plans and foundations look to them to fill their growth investing needs. Individual investors get the benefit of the same research and approach to growth stock investing through their family of mutual funds as well as account program.
