Novo&#8217;s purpose and objectives are to manage the Foundation&#8217;s financial assets and to ensure the Foundation sufficient dividends to cover its grant obligations for medical and scientific research etc. in Scandinavia.</p>\n\n<p>Novo A/S attains these objectives through:\ncompliance with the rules and principles which are set out in the Articles of Association of the Novo Nordisk Foundation regarding exercise of the voting rights of A and B shares in Novo Nordisk A/S and Novozymes A/S, respectively, \nassurance that all companies in which the company has a material influence actively contribute to the development of the Novo Group and operate their business in accordance with the visions and values of the Novo Group, \nmaintenance of a material influence on Novo Nordisk A/S and Novozymes A/S, and \ninvestment and financing business including placing of capital in companies and real property domestically and abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Novoâ€™s overall investment strategy is thus to maintain ownership of Novo Nordiskâ€™ and Novozymesâ€™ shares at a level just above 25% and to invest dividends from these companies and other income in the life science area as well as in a broad portfolio of financial assets.</p>\n\n<p>Novo A/S has since 1999 established itself as an international venture capital partner in the life science area and has invested in over 50 companies in Denmark, Europe and North America. </p>\n\n<p>Through its financial investment activities Novo A/S seeks to spread the companyâ€™s total financial risk and at the same time to ensure a high return taking into consideration the chosen risk profile. </p>\n\n<p>In 2007 Novo A/S together with the Novo Nordisk Foundation established â€˜Novo Seedsâ€™. The new program (split into two sub-programs) is aimed at supporting early stage applied research in the life science area in Scandinavia. </p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2009 Novo A/S launched a new initiative, investing &#8216;growth equity&#8217; into promising later stage/commercial stage life science companies. </p>\n\n<p>Novo A/S represents the interests of the Novo Nordisk Foundation through participation on the boards of the companies in the Novo Group.</p>\n\n<p>The companies in the Novo Group are members of a &#8216;family of companies&#8217;, independently managed, but sharing a set of common values as set out in the &#8216;Charter for Companies in the Novo Group&#8217;. In the Charter these core values, commitments and management principles that companies in the Novo Group should live up to are described.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/6080/46080v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[133,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/6080/46080v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[133,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/6080/46080v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Krogshoejvej 41  ","address2":"","zip_code":"DK-2880 ","city":"Bagsvaerd","state_code":null,"country_code":"DNK","latitude":55.756899,"longitude":12.4549941},{"description":"USA Visiting address","address1":"Novo Ventures (US) Inc.  1700 Owens Street, Suite 540","address2":"","zip_code":"94158","city":"San Francisco","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Henrik","last_name":"Gürtler","permalink":"henrik-grtler","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0004/6082/46082v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[227,158],"assets/images/resized/0004/6082/46082v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[227,158],"assets/images/resized/0004/6082/46082v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman of the board","person":{"first_name":"Ulf","last_name":"J.
