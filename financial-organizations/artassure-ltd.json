We negotiate all arrangements, both financial and contractual, to assure your art is placed to achieve maximum value, at minimum expense, and with appropriate marketing effort.</p>\n\n<p>Acquisitions - We arrange the sale of collections or individual works valued up to $300,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>Financing - We specialize in asset based lending using art, and art alone, as collateral. We offer interim non-recourse loans at competitive rates for both buyers and sellers who wish to obtain liquidity quickly. </p>\n\n<p>Price Guarantees - We eliminate risk and uncertainty for sellers by providing price guarantees for both collections and individual works of art to be auctioned or sold privately. Our guarantees are more financially attractive than those offered by the auction houses and are often available on works that the auctions houses will not guarantee. </p>\n\n<p>Art Investment - As an asset class art has outperformed other asset classes during the last 20 years. If investing in art is your goal, we can assist you in shaping a portfolio to your chosen risk/reward profile.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2864/182864v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/2864/182864v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/2864/182864v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"136 East 74th Street","address2":"","zip_code":"10021","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Asher","last_name":"Edelman","permalink":"asher-edelman","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Ethan","last_name":"Vallarino","permalink":"ethan-vallarino","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Associate","person":{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Dermont","permalink":"andrew-dermont","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Art Law, Research, Placement","person":{"first_name":"Adelaide","last_name":"Rabourdin","permalink":"adelaide-rabourdin","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094304575029583894223908.html","title":""}]}
