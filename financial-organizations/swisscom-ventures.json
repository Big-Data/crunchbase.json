As a value-added investor, Swisscom brings its investee companies the technical expertise and strategic insights of an incumbent telecom operator. We act as a bridge to Swisscom&#8217;s operational business units, including Swisscom Labs, which portfolio companies can also leverage as a test environment for their products and services.</p>\n\n<p>As such, Swisscom Ventures seeks minority stakes in companies related to the emerging information/ communications/entertainment space. We also invest to spin out internal Swisscom business concepts. We will consider opportunities from any geographic region (although with a general preference for Europe), and prefer companies at early to mid stage in their life cycle.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0005/8539/58539v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,110],"assets/images/resized/0005/8539/58539v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,110],"assets/images/resized/0005/8539/58539v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"3050","city":"Bern","state_code":null,"country_code":"CHE","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Officer","person":{"first_name":"PÃ¤r","last_name":"Lange","permalink":"pr-lange","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Swisscom Ventures","person":{"first_name":"Dominique","last_name":"Mégret","permalink":"dominique-mgret","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","person":{"first_name":"Rob","last_name":"Trice","permalink":"rob-trice","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,131],"assets/images/resized/0002/3193/23193v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[115,131],"assets/images/resized/0002/3193/23193v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[115,131],"assets/images/resized/0002/3193/23193v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rob Trice / <a href=\"http://www.nokiagrowthpartners.com/our_team.html\" title=\"Nokia ZGrowth Partners\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nokia ZGrowth Partners</a></p>"}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Officer","person":{"first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"Kuentz","permalink":"stefan-kuentz","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Financial Manager","person":{"first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Grassi","permalink":"carlo-grassi","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.eetimes.eu/212900678","source_description":"Firecomms raises $5 million","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Firecomms","permalink":"firecomms","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,37],"assets/images/resized/0005/3392/53392v1-max-150x150.png"],[[125,37],"assets/images/resized/0005/3392/53392v1-max-250x250.png"],[[125,37],"assets/images/resized/0005/3392/53392v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2009/11/02/assia-takes-10m-to-manage-speed-dsl-service/","source_description":"Click here to find out more!
