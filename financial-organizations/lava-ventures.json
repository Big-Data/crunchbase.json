First, LAVA was a forum that brought potential private equity, venture and angel investors together with entrepreneurs looking for funding. Like the Band of Angels in Northern California, the Tech Coast Angels, the Pasadena Angels, and other angel groups of today, early meetings consisted of primarily angel-type investors listening to short pitches from entrepreneurs about the merits of their business ideas. The business plans were screened by Diana Ho and later by a group she led before the plans were presented to the membership. The ideas were then subjected to questions and the entrepreneurs left better informed than when they arrived. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/8282/68282v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,108],"assets/images/resized/0006/8282/68282v1-max-250x250.png"],[[269,117],"assets/images/resized/0006/8282/68282v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"11301 Olympic Blvd. #376","address2":"","zip_code":"90064","city":"Los Angeles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","person":{"first_name":"Sami","last_name":"Revah","permalink":"sami-revah","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"f","source_url":"http://onbiovc.com/sleep-solutions-inc-series-f-20m/","source_description":"Sleep Solutions, Inc.: Series F $20M","raised_amount":20000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":30,"company":{"name":"Sleep Solutions","permalink":"sleep-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0006/4298/64298v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,44],"assets/images/resized/0006/4298/64298v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[342,61],"assets/images/resized/0006/4298/64298v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
