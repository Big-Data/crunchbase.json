We provide a solution for historical investors in quality companies who are now - typically for structural or strategic reasons - looking to achieve liquidity.</p>\n\n<p>Our approach allows management and other investors to &#8216;play forward&#8217;, giving the company more money and time in order to deliver greater upside. Our funds maintain significant reserves of fresh capital in order that we can support the development and growth of portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p>We focus on quality assets with good future prospects for which we can justify paying market prices. We deploy venture investing skills to undertake due diligence to assess a target company&#8217;s future prospects. Whether acquiring all or part of a company, we are looking to deploy a minimum of Â£3 million per company, plus follow on funding, to secure an influential stake in the business.</p>\n\n<p>Following the investment we work in close partnership with management teams, the board and the company&#8217;s advisors to help companies realise their full potential.</p>\n\n<p>Investment criteria\nAzini seeks to liberate IP rich software, technology, material science and specialist manufacturing companies from constraints that may have built up over the companyâ€™s life and on enabling companies to access fresh capital to support development and growth.</p>\n\n<p>We are principally interested in UK founded technology orientated companies with international or global potential. We have extensive experience in working with companies to establish a presence, management, sales capability or even to completely migrate to the US.</p>\n\n<p>Azini Capitalâ€™s targets are likely to have some of the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<p>Software, technology, material science or specialist / high-tech manufacturing companies with core intellectual property.\nCommitted management team with deep domain expertise.\nCompanies are likely to have been established within the past 4 to 8 years.\nProbably historically backed by corporate or venture capital backers or by private â€˜angelâ€™ investors.\nEither cash flow neutral but with a requirement for development capital or consuming a small amount of cash but with a clear path to cash flow break even.\nAn ability to acquire the entire company or a significant stake in the company from an existing investor.\nAzini does not, at this time, fulfil the role of a traditional venture capital fund in providing solely an injection of fresh capital without acquiring a stake in the company from an existing shareholder.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0005/6683/56683v1-max-150x150.png"],[[177,88],"assets/images/resized/0005/6683/56683v1-max-250x250.png"],[[177,88],"assets/images/resized/0005/6683/56683v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"29 Farm Street","address2":"","zip_code":"W1J 5RL","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.5092351,"longitude":-0.148788}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/Antenova-raises-$6-5M-to-expand-antenna-module-business_a1119.html","source_description":"Antenova raises $6.5M to expand antenna module business","raised_amount":6500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"Antenova","permalink":"antenova","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0005/3648/53648v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,22],"assets/images/resized/0005/3648/53648v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,41],"assets/images/resized/0005/3648/53648v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2010/12/mobixell-networks-raises-10m-in-funding.html","source_description":"Mobixell Networks Raises $10m in Funding","raised_amount":10000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Mobixell Networks","permalink":"mobixell","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/1644/21644v1-max-150x150.png"],[[209,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/1644/21644v1-max-250x250.png"],[[209,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/1644/21644v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2012/05/onespin-solutions-secures-funding-azini-capital.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"OneSpin Solutions Secures Funding from Azini Capital","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":31,"company":{"name":"OneSpin Solutions","permalink":"onespin-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0010/4117/104117v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,60],"assets/images/resized/0010/4117/104117v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,60],"assets/images/resized/0010/4117/104117v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
