Too many real estate and mortgage sales systems, and products (website tools, marketing systems, contact management systems, coaching systems, etc.) focus on &#8220;selling&#8221; yourself or your product. NetWorth Partners provides the tools and direction and teach real estate or mortgage professionals how to be successful in their business without &#8220;selling&#8221; at all. Their business model is a different approach to providing professional real estate services to clients, and can easily increase business by 200%-300%, or easily provide at least 12-15 additional transactions each year to what you are already doing. They started the system in San Diego California in 1997, and are now expanding their membership nationwide.</p>","image":null,"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"12520 High Bluff Dr Ste 220","address2":"","zip_code":"92130","city":"San Diego","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/100231","source_description":"","raised_amount":30000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":1999,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Cooking.com","permalink":"cooking-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0000/2965/2965v1-max-150x150.png"],[[196,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/2965/2965v1-max-250x250.png"],[[196,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/2965/2965v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
