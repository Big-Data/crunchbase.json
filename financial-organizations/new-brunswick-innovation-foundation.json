Since many financial institutions consider startups and R&amp;D â€œtoo risky,â€ some of the most commercially viable projects simply fall through the cracks and die. But not in New Brunswick. At NBIF our venture capital and research funding fills the gap so many innovators fall through, so they can break through.</p>\n\n<p>What sets us apart from traditional capital providers is the way we do business. Instead of lending, we make investments in your companyâ€™s equity. Instead of making research grants, the funding we provide attaches certain rights to the intellectual property you develop so we can help commercialize it.  And the money we make? It goes right back into the Foundation so we can get even more research projects and companies goingâ€”over and over again. Letting us invest in you lets you invest in New Brunswick, too. Itâ€™s what makes us unique.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it starts in a university laboratory, or on the desktop of a budding entrepreneur, our aim is to build New Brunswickâ€™s capacity to innovate and create commercial opportunities for our five strategic industries. With $40 million under management, the investments we&#8217;ve made have allowed our researchers and companies to leverage over $160 million more in additional capital.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0010/2835/102835v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,64],"assets/images/resized/0010/2835/102835v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,64],"assets/images/resized/0010/2835/102835v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Suite 602, King Tower ","address2":"440 King Street ","zip_code":"E3B 5H8","city":"Fredericton ","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://www.nbif.ca/eng/media/releases/nbif-invests-500000-to-drive-encore-interactive-to-market/","source_description":"NBIF Invests $500,000 to Drive Encore Interactive to Market","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":9,"company":{"name":"Encore Interactive","permalink":"encore-interactive","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0007/5497/75497v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,67],"assets/images/resized/0007/5497/75497v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[248,67],"assets/images/resized/0007/5497/75497v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.growthworks.ca/files/news_releases/2005/AnyWareGroupOct24Final.pdf","source_description":"AnyWare Group Attracts Venture Capital to Fund Expansion","raised_amount":3700000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":24,"company":{"name":"AnyWare Group","permalink":"anyware-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0010/5848/105848v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/5848/105848v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0010/5848/105848v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
