Their team consists of investors who have also founded and grown companies, so they know how to help because they have done it themselves. Their philosophy is to provide support to help you turn your idea or technology into a self-sustaining business with real value. They expect the managers of their portfolio companies to own significant equity stakes.</p>\n\n<p>DFJ Frontier typically invests $100,000 to $1,000,000 initially, with additional capital reserved for follow-on investment as the company successfully achieves key milestones.
