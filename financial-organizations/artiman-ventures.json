They are actively involved with entrepreneurs from the earliest stages of company creation in distilling ideas and opportunities, brainstorming, refining business plans, building high energy teams, developing channel partners and customers, and syndicating venture financings.</p>\n\n<p>The cornerstone of Artimanâ€™s technology-diversified investment strategy is investing in &#8216;white spaces&#8217;, which they define as large opportunities where a company has no identifiable competitors, and a market or technology lead of at least twelve months. They are typically the first institutional capital, most often at the &#8216;concept stage&#8217; when the founders are still refining their key ideas and concepts. At the &#8216;concept stage&#8217;, the Artiman team acts as collaborative partners to the founding team, helping with all aspects of strategy, market definition and company creation.</p>\n\n<p>Their initial investments range in size from $100K seed to a conventional Series A investment of $2-4M. They prefer to limit aggregate investment over the life of a company to approximately $10M in capital.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0002/2863/22863v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/2863/22863v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/2863/22863v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"2000
