We work with the venture capital community and angel groups in the Southwestern area.\nNew Mexico Angels (NMA) was formed in the Spring of 1999 to invest in New Mexico-based high growth potential early stage and seed companies. (Originally incorporated as New Mexico Prvate Investors, Inc., the name changed in 2006.) NMA is not a venture fund, and it does not make direct investments; it does, however, serve as an intermediary between its members and potential investment opportunities. Itâ€™s members make direct investments through the vehicle of NMA. NMA negotiates the terms of the deal, the entrepreneur then agrees to those terms (or negotiates further), and then the members decide to invest (or not).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/2837/102837v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,109],"assets/images/resized/0010/2837/102837v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[323,142],"assets/images/resized/0010/2837/102837v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"1155 University Boulevard SE ","address2":"","zip_code":"87106","city":"Albuquerque","state_code":"NM","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.flywheelventures.com/images/press/Comet_series_a.pdf","source_description":"Comet Solutions Secures Final Tranche of Series A","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Comet Solutions","permalink":"comet-solutions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/1720/71720v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/1720/71720v1-max-250x250.png"],[[267,82],"assets/images/resized/0007/1720/71720v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
