They seek to leverage our experience in principal investing and managing businesses to provide expert advice to clients. Typically they participate as investors in those companies for which we provide advisory services.</p>\n\n<p>In 1967 Gulf &amp; Western Corporation acquired New Jersey Zinc at the outset of building one of the most famous diversified conglomerates in corporate history. David Carpenter joined New Jersey Zinc in 1966 as a chemical engineer and in 1980 coordinated the liquidation of the Natural Resources Group of Gulf &amp; Western. In 1981 Mr. Carpenter co-founded Horsehead Industries to facilitate the acquisition of New Jersey Zinc from Gulf &amp; Western.</p>\n\n<p>Horsehead served as a vehicle to make strategic acquisitions and build companies in the metals, mining, and industrial sectors during the 1980s and 1990s when the Company orchestrated transactions totaling $3 billion. Our investment history includes the reacquisition of Horsehead Industries in 2002 to affect a turnaround of the worldâ€™s largest recycler of Electric Arc Furnace dust and largest U.S. producer of zinc. In addition, we have made investments in the technology, communications, business services, healthcare and hospitality sectors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/4136/34136v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,86],"assets/images/resized/0003/4136/34136v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[175,86],"assets/images/resized/0003/4136/34136v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"200 Railroad Avenue, 3rd Floor","address2":"","zip_code":"06830","city":"Greenwich","state_code":"CT","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Dave","last_name":"Carpenter","permalink":"dave-carpenter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Carpenter","permalink":"james-carpenter","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"R.
