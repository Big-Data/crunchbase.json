With more than 1,500 employees worldwide, SIG sits at the helm of the latest trends and developments in trading and market making, institutional sales, research, private equity, venture capital, and investment banking. SIG has offices across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.</p>\n\n<p>SIG distinguishes itself through its global market presence, capital commitment, and its grasp of trading dynamics. It excels at decision theory and implementing sophisticated pricing probability models.</p>\n\n<p>Their distinction lies in their approach to problem solving - a process guided by the tenets of decision theory and probability. Every choice they make, whether it is developing a new business line, executing a particularly challenging transaction, or bringing new members of the SIG team on board, is done with an eye keen to how that decision affects their overall growth strategy. They believe that their most successful endeavors depend on how well their choices fit together. Their sound decision-making acumen in uncertain environments gives us a substantial intellectual and analytical edge in the global marketplace.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0003/0276/30276v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/0276/30276v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[265,25],"assets/images/resized/0003/0276/30276v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"Bala Cynwyd Office","address1":"401 City Avenue","address2":"Suite 220","zip_code":"19004-1188","city":"Bala Cynwyd,","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.0044456,"longitude":-75.2195583},{"description":"Boston Office","address1":"1 Boston Place, ","address2":"Suite 2020","zip_code":"02108","city":"Boston","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":42.358517,"longitude":-71.058374},{"description":"New York Office","address1":"40 Wall Street,","address2":"Third and Fourth Floors","zip_code":"10005","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":40.706939,"longitude":-74.0099}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Investment Banking","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"J.
