The group meets once a month over dinner and listens to presentations from candidate companies. If some members show interest in a presenting company, the group facilitates their efforts to share further due diligence. Members act on their own behalf and make individual investment decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Sacramento Angels membership is open to individuals who are accredited investors with the experience and desire to invest in and work directly with emerging-technology companies. The members have a wide range of backgrounds, including CEO&#8217;s, senior executives, entrepreneurs, attorneys and professional venture capitalists. They apply this considerable experience to assist their investments with business strategy and implementation, team building and fundraising.</p>\n\n<p>Interested prospective members are invited to complete and submit a membership application. Entrepreneurs whose companies are in need of angel funding should review the investment criteria. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/9797/29797v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/9797/29797v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/9797/29797v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"zip_code":null,"city":null,"state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":37.09024,"longitude":-95.712891}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-ex-apple-vps-freepath-raises-13-million-for-multimedia-presentations/","source_description":"Ex-Apple VPâ€™s Freepath Raises $1.3 Million For Multimedia Presentations","raised_amount":1300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Freepath","permalink":"freepath","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,130],"assets/images/resized/0002/0714/20714v1-max-150x150.png"],[[155,135],"assets/images/resized/0002/0714/20714v1-max-250x250.png"],[[155,135],"assets/images/resized/0002/0714/20714v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/08/reframe-it-raises-2-3-million-for-web-annotation-product/","source_description":"Reframe It Raises $2.3 Million For Web Annotation Product","raised_amount":2300000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":8,"company":{"name":"Reframe It","permalink":"reframe-it","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0002/6351/26351v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,124],"assets/images/resized/0002/6351/26351v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,224],"assets/images/resized/0002/6351/26351v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2011/03/03/5352862.htm","source_description":"Glue Networks Secures $4.5 Million in Series A Financing ","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Glue Networks","permalink":"glue-networks","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0012/4919/124919v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[241,78],"assets/images/resized/0012/4919/124919v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[241,78],"assets/images/resized/0012/4919/124919v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
