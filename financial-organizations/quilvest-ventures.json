For more than 100 years and six generations it has served one family, the heirs of Otto Peter Bemberg, on three continents â€“ the Americas, Europe and Asia. Over this period, Quilvest has multiplied the wealth of its shareholders many times and has consistently achieved double-digit absolute returns.</p>\n\n<p>Quilvestâ€™s success in preserving and growing the wealth of its family shareholders prompted the Group to share its experience and expertise with other high net worth families and individuals. The Groupâ€™s 150 professionals and five offices now serve both the family shareholders and third-party clients across all the main global investment markets: the United States, Western Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. Today, the Group manages over $6 billion on behalf of its shareholders and clients.</p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"e","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/03/21/ampd-mobile-raises-whopping-107m-fifth-round-of-financing/","source_description":"VentureBeat","raised_amount":107000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":21,"company":{"name":"Ampâ€™d Mobile","permalink":"ampd-mobile","image":null}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/2007/03/20/intarcia-restarts-with-50m-for-hepatitis-diabetes-treatments/","source_description":"Intarcia restarts with $50M for hepatitis, diabetes treatments","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"Intarcia Therapeutics","permalink":"intarcia-therapeutics","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0006/2213/62213v1-max-150x150.png"],[[157,89],"assets/images/resized/0006/2213/62213v1-max-250x250.png"],[[157,89],"assets/images/resized/0006/2213/62213v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/333529/social-mediabuzz-marketing-agency-vanksen-raises-5m-round-investment-quilvest-private-eq","source_description":"Social Media/Buzz Marketing Agency Vanksen Raises $5M in Round A Investment from Quilvest Private Equity","raised_amount":5000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":26,"company":{"name":"Vanksen","permalink":"vanksen","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0008/8679/88679v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0008/8679/88679v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[318,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/8679/88679v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://frontier-silicon.com/media/releases/05/0228_28minvest.htm","source_description":"Frontier Silicon closes $28 million investment led by ACT Venture Capital and Apax Partners' Funds","raised_amount":28000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2005,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":28,"company":{"name":"Frontier Silicon","permalink":"frontier-silicon","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/6444/76444v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[205,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6444/76444v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[205,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6444/76444v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
