The fund focuses primarily on e-Services, e-Marketing, and Wireless Internet. In April 2000, the firm formed a partnership with Investcorp International, Inc. called Investcorp/(212) Ventures Technology Fund I. This vehicle focuses on the Internet infrastructure services, wireless technology sectors and companies that offer technologies that will benefit both brick-and-mortar companies and dot-coms. Following the closure of 212 Ventures, the Investcorp/(212) Ventures Technology Fund was absorbed by Investcorp to form a larger fund called Investcorp Technology Ventures.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=120815\" title=\"BusinessWeek\" rel=\"nofollow\">BusinessWeek</a></p>","image":null,"offices":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Altucher","permalink":"james-altucher","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/0069/160069v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/0069/160069v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,258],"assets/images/resized/0016/0069/160069v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"providerships":[],"funds":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[]}
