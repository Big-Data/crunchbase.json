He has been a computer hacker since the 1980s, cited in Lotus Magazine in his early teens. Adamâ€™s passion for viral user experience design led him to create Twibes, a Twitter group site. Adam has worked as a software consultant for both giant and tiny companies, but prefers startups. He got burnt out in 1996 and took a short 11 month trip around the world to visit 24 countries.</p>\n\n<p>Adam was featured in Microsoftâ€™s â€œA Startup A Weekâ€ documentary series, where he built a Facebook app to help Room to Read raise money for a computer lab in Cambodia. Adam is also the inventor of the Zuckerbuck (one of the first virtual currencies on Facebook). His Facebook app â€œDumb Americansâ€ won an overnight coding contest at the CommunityNext conference in San Jose. In addition to being the founder of Twibes, and chief dog walker for his Great Dane Gretel, Adam is â€œmashup guyâ€ at Gist â€“ a company he helped incubate for Vulcan Capital.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/5735/65735v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/5735/65735v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[434,434],"assets/images/resized/0006/5735/65735v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS with College Honors","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"University of Washington","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Twibes","permalink":"twibes","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Linksy.me","permalink":"linksy-me","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Linksy","permalink":"linksy","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0020/6672/206672v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0020/6672/206672v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,95],"assets/images/resized/0020/6672/206672v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/adamloving","title":"@adamloving"},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/adamloving","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
