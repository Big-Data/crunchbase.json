Hired after an internship in 2008, Ben Blanton assumed daily producing duties on the station&#8217;s morning newscast within four months of being hired as a part-time writer.</p>\n\n<p>After two years of producing two hours a day of live, local morning television, Ben was promoted to evening producer. He oversaw the only 6:30 PM newscast in the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson-Asheville market, offering viewers a local alternative to network news. </p>\n\n<p>In 2012, WHNS management asked Ben Blanton to launch the station&#8217;s first 11 PM newscast. He quickly established the show&#8217;s position in the market, drawing viewers away from other more traditional and established late-night options. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4588/214588v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[203,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/4588/214588v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[365,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/4588/214588v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"Broadcast Journalism","institution":"Bob Jones University","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/19670849/plant-expansion-to-create-new-jobs-in-greenville-county","title":"Article by Ben Blanton \"Plant expansion to create jobs in Greenville County\""},{"external_url":"http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/14914454/report-greenville-has-best-tasting-tap-water-in-the-nation","title":"Article by Ben Blanton \"Report: Greenville has best tasting tap water in the nation\""},{"external_url":"http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/19741181/officials-promise-no-questions-during-explosives-amnesty-week","title":"Article by Ben Blanton \"Officials to collect explosives, offer amnesty\""},{"external_url":"http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/19711418/upstate-officers-stage-swat-drills","title":"Article by Ben Blanton \"Upstate officers stage hostage drills\""},{"external_url":"http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/15232486/spartanburg-street-named-for-legendary-beacon-employee","title":"Article by Ben Blanton \"Spartanburg street named for legendary Beacon employee\""},{"external_url":"http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/15618693/spartanburg-charter-school-program-director-arrested","title":"Article by Ben Blanton \"Charter School program director arrested\""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://benjaminblanton.com/","title":"Ben Blanton news producer profile and writing samples"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/benblantongreenvillesc","title":"Ben Blanton on LinkedIN"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/ben.blanton.10","title":"Ben Blanton on Facebook"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/bblan751","title":"Ben Blanton on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://benblantonproducer.posterous.com/","title":"Ben Blanton Posterous blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.lookuppage.com/users/benblanton/","title":"Ben Blanton on LookUp Page"},{"external_url":"http://flavors.me/benblantonproducer","title":"Ben Blanton on Flavor.me"},{"external_url":"http://cvshare.net/benblanton","title":"Ben Blanton on CVShare"},{"external_url":"http://benblantongreenvillesc.tumblr.com/","title":"Ben Blanton on Tumblr"}]}
