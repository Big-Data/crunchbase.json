His focus has been on internet and music related start-ups (admittedly a web and music nut). During his undergraduate studies, he started a textbook rental business, a online customer acquisition company and an online ticketing business. In his spare time he found time to work for the Disneyland Resort as a tour guide and guest relations host (also a theme park nut). Immediately after receiving his Bachelors Degree in Business Management (Magna Cum Laude), he started Music America Records, which was an online record label and music publishing company. After Music America Records, he simultaneously started Bluewire Connect and Praise Collection. Bluewire Connect provided custom branded social networks to recording artists and then expanded to colleges, universities, companies and organizations. Praise Collection acquired the rights to thousands of hours of rare, live performances featuring some of the world&#8217;s most famous gospel and country artists including Chet Atkins, CeCe Winans, Fred Hammond, Yolanda Adams and many others. The performances were compiled into a subscription DVD service and sold through direct marketing channels. Jeremy started Project Playlist in February, 2006 as a weekend hobby. After launching a MySpace widget for Project Playlist, the site traffic exploded. Recently ranked by Comscore as one of the fastest growing sites on the internet, Project Playlist now has over 39 million registered users (growing at 80,000 new registrations per day) and 25 million playlist widgets embedded all over the internet.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0002/7627/27627v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0002/7627/27627v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0002/7627/27627v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>(Credit: Greg Sandoval/CNET News.coml)</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"founder","firm":{"name":"Project Playlist","permalink":"projectplaylist","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0019/7985/197985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[224,68],"assets/images/resized/0019/7985/197985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[224,68],"assets/images/resized/0019/7985/197985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Project Playlist","permalink":"projectplaylist","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0019/7985/197985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[224,68],"assets/images/resized/0019/7985/197985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[224,68],"assets/images/resized/0019/7985/197985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.myspace.com/jeremyriney","title":"Myspace Profile "}]}
