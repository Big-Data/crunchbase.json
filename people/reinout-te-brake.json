As the former strategist of Spil Games, Reinout oversaw the foundation from a young games company to one of the most recognized Casual Games Enterprises in the entire industry â€“ in just under three years.</p>\n\n<p>Reinout left Spil Games in 2008 to start up his own company. It was 6 months later when MMO Life was born, the first localized MMO games network. Reinoutâ€™s story is perhaps not as unique as it is poignant. With his own start-up capital, late night meetings around the kitchen table, and week-end programming, the first portal in wordpress went live in January, 2009. The domain was MMOhub.org (now MMOgames.com). In 12 months an additional 10 MMO portals were in the air covering the regions of Europe, North-America, Brazil, India and China.</p>\n\n<p>But transformation didnâ€™t take place there. Instead it paved the way for a new strategy, with the establishment of an echo-system off MMO games, bringing traffic and game sign-ups to MMO developers through affiliate partners. MMOTraffic.com was born! http://www.mmotraffic.com</p>\n\n<p>Reinout is considered influential in the gaming industry. With a passion for entrepreneurship, strategies and change heâ€™s been frequently featured in the media.</p>\n\n<p>Reinoutâ€™s work methods falls nothing short of controversial. He often takes a radical approach from vision and idea creation, to architecting strategies and execution. With his â€œImitate and Innovateâ€ slogan, he has transformed companies, bringing in new concepts, methods and ideas based on proven business strategies and success formulas.</p>\n\n<p>His stern, sure-fire and entirely present persona, cuts him an interesting character in the world of games. One thing is for sure; we havenâ€™t seen the last of the man known for his sock-less feet, a slight Eastern Holland accent, with a Partagas-Havana No 2 cigar in the corner of his mouth and an iPhone stuck to his ear.\nSpecialties</p>\n\n<p>Marketing, Finance, Legal, Acquisition, Mergers/joint ventures &amp; Business Development</p>\n\n<p>Well the recommendations on linkedin say it all; http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=1984068#recommendations</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/3256/23256v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/3256/23256v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/3256/23256v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","firm":{"name":"iQU","permalink":"iqu","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0012/4825/124825v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/4825/124825v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,202],"assets/images/resized/0012/4825/124825v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/16/iqu-launches-marketing-and-analytics-service-for-online-games/","title":"iQU launches marketing and analytics service for online games"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.iqu.com","title":"iQU.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/reinouttebrake","title":"Linkedin Reinout te Brake"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/onlinemmorpg","title":"Facebook Reinout te Brake"}]}
