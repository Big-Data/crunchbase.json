Factory, where he developed and oversaw the labelâ€™s entire audio, live concert DVD, and comedy DVD release schedule, working with dozens of heritage artists ranging from pop icons William Shatner and the Bangles to Grammy legends Herb Alpert and Solomon Burke.</p>\n\n<p>Shawn also released his own album â€œThank You Shirl-ee Mayâ€ on the Shout! Factory label (he released two other albums earlier in the decade). During this time, Amos worked with Shoutâ€™s ownership to create a digital strategy that led to the formation of the standalone digital media company, GetBack. Aside from steering GetBackâ€™s popular content, Amos served as the face of the company, hosting its flagship video program â€œRetro Minuteâ€ which received 230 million impressions monthly via out network of out-of- home screens at Wal-Mart check out, supermarket check out, gas stations, coffee houses, and bookstores.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, as an A&amp;R executive at Rhino Entertainment, Shawn steered editorial content for the reissue labelâ€™s deluxe anthologies and box sets, hiring award-winning entertainment critics, essayists and authors. He then went on to produce single and various artists collections from such heritage musical acts as INXS, The Sugarhill Gang and Quincy Jones (for whom Amos later ran the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation).</p>\n\n<p>Shawn is the son of Wally Amos, founder of the Famous Amos brand, and the first African-American talent agent for the William Morris Agency. Growing up in the colorful Hollywood landscape inspired Shawn to pursue a career in film (he attended NYUâ€™s Tisch School of the Arts) then music and digital media. He is currently writing his first book, a memoir titled â€œCookies &amp; Milk: Scenes From a â€™70s Hollywood Childhood.â€ Shawn sits on the Board of Trustees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and serves as secretary on the Los Angeles Board of Governors of the Recording Academy.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0049/100049v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,157],"assets/images/resized/0010/0049/100049v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[157,157],"assets/images/resized/0010/0049/100049v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"Freshwire","permalink":"freshwire","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/7804/207804v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/7804/207804v2-max-250x250.png"],[[267,267],"assets/images/resized/0020/7804/207804v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"Amos Content Group","permalink":"amos-content-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0010/0789/100789v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0010/0789/100789v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,188],"assets/images/resized/0010/0789/100789v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"PopNews Wire","permalink":"popnews-wire","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0871/100871v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/0871/100871v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/0871/100871v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP of Content","firm":{"name":"GetBack.com","permalink":"getback-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Content_Group","title":"Amos Content Group Wikipedia"},{"external_url":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/shawn-amos/id5576839","title":"iTunes"},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Amos","title":"Shawn Amos Wikipedia"},{"external_url":"http://amoscontentgroup.com/","title":"Amos Content Group"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Amos-Content-Group/167334563617","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.popnewswire.tv/","title":"PopNews Wire"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/PopNewsWire","title":"Twitter"}]}
