Various degrees from mathematics to computer science can be found crumpled in Jeff&#8217;s old files, along with dozens of powerful application models, dissertations, book drafts, and an incomplete symphony. At some point he crossed over to the dark side and taught complex math at the graduate level, but ultimately he was disillusioned by poverty. It took just a bit of persistence to lure him to the light of capitalism.</p>\n\n<p>Jeff lords over RedNova Labs&#8217; technological inventions - including the powerful proprietary tools that speed development for web and mobile connectivity - while the rest of us gawk in awe. Jeff writes compliers, operation systems, 3D game engines, bayesian networks, and AIs, as well as iPhone programs.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor Science","subject":"Mathematics, Computer Science","institution":"Kansas State University","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
