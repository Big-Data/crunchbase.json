He has been involved in the development of the NOD antivirus system since 1987, and co-authored its first version. In 1992 he founded ESET, spol. s r.o. with his partners, where he currently holds the position of Chief Executive Officer Officer. </p>\n\n<p>Recalling his beginnings in the antivirus software business, Miroslav Trnka says: â€œWe did not want to create virus protection software just for ourselves. Together with Peter PaÅ¡ko, we wanted to give people something that would solve their virus problems also. At that time, two years before the â€˜velvet revolutionâ€™, we had no intention of launching the software commercially. Since there was a very popular TV series at that time called â€˜Nemocnica na okraji mestaâ€™ (Hospital on the Outskirts of the City), we decided to call our software â€˜Nemocnica na Okraji Disku â€“ NODâ€™ (Hospital on the Outskirts of the Disk).â€ </p>\n\n<p>He has been selected as the &#8220;Entrepreneur of the Year&#8221; by Ernst &amp; Young in 2006, in the first edition of this award in Slovakia. CRN Magazine included him as one of the 25 Most Innovative Executives of 2010.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/5234/115234v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/5234/115234v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0011/5234/115234v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","firm":{"name":"ESET","permalink":"eset","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0011/1025/111025v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,78],"assets/images/resized/0011/1025/111025v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,78],"assets/images/resized/0011/1025/111025v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/228300327/the-25-most-innovative-executives-of-2010.htm;jsessionid=vGm7nIrxjEeUxqWa6z3adg**.ecappj02?pgno=5","title":"The 25 Most Innovative Executives Of 2010"},{"external_url":"http://www.ey.com/SK/en/About-us/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year-2006","title":"Slovak Entrepreneur of the Year 2006"}],"web_presences":[]}
