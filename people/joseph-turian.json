He also run the <a href=\"http://metaoptimize.com/qa/\" title=\"MetaOpÂ­tiÂ­mize Q&amp;A site\" rel=\"nofollow\">MetaOpÂ­tiÂ­mize Q&amp;A site</a>, where Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing experts share their knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>Joseph Turian specializes in data problems that are large scale, and\nrequire well-engineered solutions. He has almost a decade of experience\nin ML+NLP, and almost two decades of experience in coding.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Turian holds a Ph.D. in computer science (with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing) from New York University since 2007. During his graduate studies, he developed a fast, large-scale machine learning method for parsing natural language. He received his AB from Harvard University in 2001.</p>\n\n<p>At age 10, Joseph Turian was awarded a scholarship at a local university, and began taking C programming courses. He has been programming ever since. In high school and college, he programmed competitively at a world-class level. In 1996, he was one of four high school students that represented the US at the international computing olympiad. In 1999, he and two Harvard team members took Harvard to 8th place in the world in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).</p>\n\n<p>As a scientist, Joseph Turian has over 14 refereed publications in top NLP + ML conferences. His team submitted the best parser in EVALITA 2009 Main+Pilot tasks. He is an advocate for open-notebook science, releasing his research code on his <a href=\"http://github.com/turian/\" title=\"github\" rel=\"nofollow\">github</a>, and for broader scientific collaboration through the internet.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,147],"assets/images/resized/0009/9122/99122v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[159,156],"assets/images/resized/0009/9122/99122v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[159,156],"assets/images/resized/0009/9122/99122v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Ph.D.","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"New York University","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MA","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"New York University","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"AB","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Harvard University","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"MetaOptimize","permalink":"metaoptimize","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://metaoptimize.com/","title":"MetaOptimize LLC"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/turian/","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://metaoptimize.com/qa/","title":"MetaOptimize Q+A"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/turian","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
