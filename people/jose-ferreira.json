He invented Kaplanâ€™s Preview/Classroom/Review course architecture, and, in 1995, led a company-wide re-engineering effort that designed the courses used today. He is the only person whose strategies the Educational Testing Service (ETS) admitted â€œbroke the codeâ€ on question types, forcing them to discard hundreds of thousands of test booklets. He also reverse-engineered the security and scoring algorithms on computerized testing, compelling the test-makers to pull the test for months of massive revisions, and earning the moniker â€œThe Antichristâ€ inside ETS. </p>\n\n<p>Jose spent 16 years thinking about and designing Knewton before he launched the company in 2008. Knewton hosts any 3rd-party education content, using network effects to provide atomic-concept-level adaptive learning to students and reporting to teachers and parents. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5133/35133v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5133/35133v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,373],"assets/images/resized/0003/5133/35133v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.dld-conference.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","firm":{"name":"Knewton","permalink":"knewton","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9086/19086v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[224,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/9086/19086v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,419],"assets/images/resized/0001/9086/19086v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
