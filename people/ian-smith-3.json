A couple of years back, he wandered into Transmutable Networks and acted like a CTO and a founder until told to leave Seattle entirely. His primary functions seem to be sitting in front of large radiation emitters, banging the home row keys, causing patterns of one and zeroes to be formed, and complaining loudly. This complaining is sometimes related to the [poor] quality of burritos available to him in eastern Europe, but more frequently is about the lack of an old-school, shotgun wedding between software development processes and the needs of actual users. Before his current loitering at Everbread, he lounged about in Seattle&#8217;s U-district under the influence of Intel Research. Previously, he ran the idle loop at PARC&#8217;s Computer Science Lab and in the far distant past he annoyed people terribly in the terminal rooms at Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech asked him to leave in 1998, PARC followed suit in 2003. He may, in fact, have no qualifications whatsoever.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,130],"assets/images/resized/0013/2535/132535v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[108,130],"assets/images/resized/0013/2535/132535v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[108,130],"assets/images/resized/0013/2535/132535v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Georgia Institute Of Technology","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief of Technical Staff","firm":{"name":"Captricity","permalink":"captricity","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0021/0090/210090v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,76],"assets/images/resized/0021/0090/210090v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,76],"assets/images/resized/0021/0090/210090v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Everbread","permalink":"everbread","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0008/1425/81425v6-max-150x150.png"],[[213,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/1425/81425v6-max-250x250.png"],[[213,39],"assets/images/resized/0008/1425/81425v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/ian.e.smith","title":"Facebook"}]}
