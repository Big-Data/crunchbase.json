PUFs are now at the heart of Intrinsic-ID technology development. As a principal scientist, he managed the cryptography cluster in Philips Research in which the initial research work on PUFs was carried out. Later, he transferred this work to Intrinsic-ID and headed the technology development. Since 2004, Pim is a visiting professor at the COSIC institute of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. His inventions have resulted in numerous patents. He is widely acclaimed for his work in the security field and PUFs in particular. Several of Pimâ€™s papers relating to PUFs have been published at leading security conferences. He co-authored the book Security with Noisy Data, which was published by Springer in 2007.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2723/182723v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2723/182723v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2723/182723v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer, Founder","firm":{"name":"Intrinsic-ID","permalink":"intrinsic-id","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0018/2718/182718v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/2718/182718v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[187,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/2718/182718v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
