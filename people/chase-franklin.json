Prior to Amdocs, Chase was a co-founder and CEO of Qpass, Inc. Under Chase&#8217;s leadership the company grew from a startup to more than 200 employees with offices in North America and Europe, before committing to a restructuring that reduced headcount to 50 and committed the company to a new strategy and market. The restructuring ultimately paved the way for five years of rapid growth, culminating in a $275 million liquidity event.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to founding Qpass in 1997, Chase Franklin spent more than a decade at Microsoft Corporation in key product development and strategic management positions. Chase played a key role in Microsoft&#8217;s transition from individual application to the suite that became Microsoft Office. He was part of the original design team for Word for Windows before transitioning to focus on the integration and interoperation of the elements of Microsoft Office. Subsequently, he spearheaded some of Microsoft&#8217;s earliest e-commerce strategy and new business development initiatives. In this role he led planning initiatives for key aspects of the original programming on Microsoft&#8217;s interactive television and MSN initiatives, including interactive advertising, online retailing, and other network commerce service businesses. As Microsoft shifted strategy in the mid-1990s to address the emerging Internet, Chase formed and led the team that partnered with Wal-Mart and created the first release of the Microsoft Merchant Server product. Chase also pioneered Microsoft&#8217;s initiatives in secure Internet payments, including SET. Chase holds 3 patents relating to the design of various Microsoft and Qpass technologies or applications.</p>\n\n<p>Chase has a double BS in Mathematics and Economics from Western Washington University.
