Previously, Alex founded Venture Weekend, an entrepreneurship event hosted at Stanford, at UT Austin, and in the bay area of California. Historically, during his high-school days, he&#8217;s covered most of his expenses (living, windsurfing, cycling, traveling, loving) by selling website subscription software at FantasticScripts.com. Before that, he ran a website development firm in Dallas, Texas with a location in Austin at CodeRAM.com. His first undertaking was a web based proxy for surfing the web anonymously - he sold this to classmates in high school (getting suspended from internet privileges in the process) and ultimately sold the business on eBay.</p>\n\n<p>Alex&#8217;s work has been featured in Popular Science magazine, eWeek, Lifehacker, CNNMoney.com Fortune, TechCrunch, CNet, and other publications.</p>\n\n<p>His biggest feat was an incredible cycling trip from Austin, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska with Texas 4000, the longest charity bike tour in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Alex attended the University of Texas at Austin in the Business Honors program - he won first prize in a consulting competition that afforded a free trip to Panama.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,136],"assets/images/resized/0002/5594/25594v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,182],"assets/images/resized/0002/5594/25594v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,182],"assets/images/resized/0002/5594/25594v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"on leave","subject":"Business Honors","institution":"University of Texas at Austin","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"CureCRM","permalink":"curecrm","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0006/9357/69357v2-max-150x150.png"],[[192,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/9357/69357v2-max-250x250.png"],[[192,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/9357/69357v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"QuickInsert","permalink":"quickinsert","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0001/2728/12728v1-max-150x150.png"],[[249,93],"assets/images/resized/0001/2728/12728v1-max-250x250.png"],[[249,93],"assets/images/resized/0001/2728/12728v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Snipd","permalink":"snipd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/3717/23717v5-max-150x150.png"],[[180,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/3717/23717v5-max-250x250.png"],[[180,63],"assets/images/resized/0002/3717/23717v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Taa_l_-W8K4&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Taa_l_-W8K4&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n<br/>\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4bp6uI4ZR4Q&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4bp6uI4ZR4Q&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Alex Schliker pitching CureCRM on the Cal Train</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://schliker.com","title":"Personal"}]}
