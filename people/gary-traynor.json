His ability to add value at a startup is strongest when he is responsible for both finance and operations.</p>\n\n<p>Gary grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota where he developed his entrepreneurial roots.  Before completing high school he had formed three successful small businesses.  He then attended Washington University in St. Louis where he received his bachelors degree in business administration.</p>\n\n<p>Following college, Gary was a commercial banking officer for a small St. Louis-based bank.  His customers were typically sole proprietors with successful entrepreneurial ventures.  Gary quickly proved himself within the bank and was selected for their management training program.  He was also assigned coverage of several of the bank&#8217;s most important client relationships.</p>\n\n<p>In 1992, Gary moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina where he and his wife could both attend graduate school.  While she completed a surgical residency (this is relevant later in the story), Gary worked on a four-year joint degree in law and business.  During the summers, Gary held internships in Bangkok for GE Capital, Prague for NATO and New York for Citibank.</p>\n\n<p>Upon graduating in 1997 with his JD/MBA (and with admission into the New York Bar), Gary accepted an investment banking position with Bear Stearns in New York.  After a brief stint in the associate pool, he selected the Financial Sponsors Group which specialized in handling the banking needs of the firm&#8217;s LBO clients.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2000, Gary was recruited by Morgan Stanley Technology Banking Group&#8217;s New York office.  Over his 3+ years with Morgan Stanley he specialized in various sectors including telecom equipment and business services.  In 2002, Gary was the project leader for one landmark transaction which was the $3.2 billion sale of PwC Consulting to IBM Global Services.</p>\n\n<p>By 2003 the technology banking market had changed considerably and Gary chose to then pursue a career more closely tied to his entrepreneurial roots by joining an early stage startup.  In January of 2004, Gary became the CFO of Portero which was a very early stage provider of eBay drop-off services.  He raised over $5 million in venture capital, built the finance department and oversaw the hiring of over 50 employees.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005 Gary was recruited to join Blue Flame Data as COO &amp; CFO.  Blue Flame was an extremely challenging turnaround situation for its primary investor, Battery Ventures and Gary spent 18 months restructuring the company.  For a complete case study, please visit Gary&#8217;s web site at www.garytraynor.com</p>\n\n<p>For the last four years Gary has turned his focus to his wife&#8217;s surgical practice by managing the entire process of taking her practice to a new level.  The company doubled revenues over the last 3-4 years with an innovative marketing plan supported by a new office and a new brand.</p>\n\n<p>As of January 2011, Gary is looking for a new challenge with a venture-backed company.  The ideal fit would include both CFO and COO responsibilities.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/8275/118275v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/8275/118275v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[449,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/8275/118275v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSBA","subject":"Business Administration, Finance and Accounting","institution":"Washington University in St. Louis","graduated_year":1989,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"JD/MBA","subject":"Law and Business","institution":"University of North Carolina","graduated_year":1997,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO","firm":{"name":"Portero","permalink":"portero","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/6525/36525v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0003/6525/36525v1-max-250x250.png"],[[267,91],"assets/images/resized/0003/6525/36525v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President of Technology Investment Banking","firm":{"name":"Morgan Stanley","permalink":"morgan-stanley","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[237,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[237,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"COO & CFO","firm":{"name":"Blue Flame Data","permalink":"blue-flame-data","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investment Banking Associate","firm":{"name":"Bear Stearns","permalink":"bear-stearns","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/8931/28931v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,110],"assets/images/resized/0002/8931/28931v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,110],"assets/images/resized/0002/8931/28931v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://venturecxo.com","title":"Summary of Venture Operating Capabilities"},{"external_url":"http://garytraynor.com","title":"Web Resume"}]}
