The combined testing time for the four sections is 14 hours.</p>\n\n<p>The CPA Examination employs a combination of question formats. It includes the traditional multiple-choice questions and essays, as well as simulationsâ€“questions that replicate workplace situations and require the application of knowledge and skills to arrive at solutions.</p>\n\n<p>In its nearly 100-year history, the Uniform CPA Examination has undergone many changes. Until the end of 2003, it was a paper-and-pencil examination administered twice each year. In April 2004, a computer-based exam was launched and the paper-and-pencil examination was discontinued. The computer-based CPA Examination achieved its millionth administration in 2009.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0010/8437/108437v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0010/8437/108437v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0010/8437/108437v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>ifrs - acca - cima - cpa - cfa</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
