The future of our children begins with us! Most people say, â€œItâ€™s never too late.â€ The Torens say, â€œItâ€™s never too early.â€ The benefits for an early introduction to the basic principles and infinite rewards of entrepreneurship are massive.

Sharpening a childâ€™s entrepreneurial skills will equip them with the skills necessary to tackle a limitless future. There is no reason it cannot start at an earlier age. Kidpreneurs puts the power in the hands of the future.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/5031/85031v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/5031/85031v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/5031/85031v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
