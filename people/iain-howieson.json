He continued there, as a PhD student and a Post Doctorate, developing novel laser based gas sensors within the Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy Group. In 1997 he moved to the National Physical Laboratory, where he worked as a consultant/lead scientist for the Centre of Optical and Environmental Metrology developing instrumentation for balloon and aircraft platforms. In 2000 he joined the start-up Quantum Beam, as a senior optical design engineer, developing free space optics for the telecom industry, where he was involved in significant IP generation. He has extensive experience in the design and development of laser based instrumentation for gas sensing. His work in this field has been internationally recognised at the highest level with the award of the prestigious Allen prize from the Optical Society of America (OSA) in 2002.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Cascade Technologies","permalink":"cascade-technologies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/5166/45166v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/5166/45166v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/5166/45166v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
