After moving to Portland in 2000 and diving into the theater arts scene for a year, he had the opportunity to travel to Mexico, Central and South America. He trained as an English teacher in Chile and went to work in Japan and Spain. His travels in twelve countries have expanded his awareness of other cultures. Working with storytellers, helping people to communicate, and writing are his favorite thingsâ€“â€“and he still enjoys performance.
