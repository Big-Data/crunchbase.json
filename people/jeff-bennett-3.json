Currently, I am the CEO of Swap.com, a Boston based company that is leading a new form of social commerce. Prior to joining Swap.com, I founded and served as President and COO of NameMedia, Inc., an online media and commerce company that owns one of the largest domain portfolios in the world. In addition, I am involved as a mentor in the acclaimed Tech Stars and MassChallenge programs that are expanding the ecosystem entrepreneurs in New England. I have also advised several ventures that include Oneforty, Adtutive (acquired by ETSY) and others. I started my work on the Internet as an executive at Lycos where I served in many roles that included Vice President of eCommerce and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Bennett earned his B.S.
