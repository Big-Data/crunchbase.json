I have a background in journalism, theatre, traditional games design, and later moved into healthcare software design and deployment.  I have co-founded three start-ups in the last 15 years, covering a wide spectrum of areas.  These have included developing the first consumer-facing ISP in the UK, and creating early Web sites; developing some of the world&#8217;s very first games for interactive TV and mobile phones (SMS, WAP, BREW and Java).  My current company is developing Moviestorm, an innovative low-cost 3d animation tool, using machinima techniques, which blend game technology with orthodox 3D animation technology.  Moviestorm is primarily aimed at consumers, but also has applications to education, business, and film and TV professionals.  I am considered one of the leading experts on machinima, and in 2004 was principal author of one of the first books on the subject.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,122],"assets/images/resized/0001/7102/17102v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,122],"assets/images/resized/0001/7102/17102v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,122],"assets/images/resized/0001/7102/17102v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Archaeology & Social Anthropology","institution":"Cambridge University","graduated_year":1988,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Creative Director","firm":{"name":"Moviestorm","permalink":"moviestorm","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,19],"assets/images/resized/0001/7076/17076v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,31],"assets/images/resized/0001/7076/17076v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/7076/17076v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
