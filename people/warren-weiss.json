He currently serves on the boards of eMeter.com, Guardian Analytics, InterAct, MarkMonitor, nGenera, Purfresh, Quantivo, Rearden Commerce, SilkRoad Technologies, and Silver Spring Networks.</p>\n\n<p>Catching emerging technologies and superstar entrepreneurs early is Warren&#8217;s passion. His close ties with leading universities and research labs give him a window into innovations in their purest form, and he cherishes the chance to work with the smartest minds in business, whether first-timers or Nobel-Prize winners. His involvement with on-demand software companies and Cleantech began years before investing in those areas became a mainstream event. Warren joined Foundation Capital in 2002 with more than 25 years experience in the software industry, including time as president and CEO of four public and private software companies. Most recently, he was president and CEO of Asera, a real-time software solutions provider.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Warren served as president and CEO of Prism Solutions during the company&#8217;s transition from data warehousing tools provider to business intelligence application deliverer. Prior to that, Warren was president of SQRIBE Technologies (now Hyperion) and earlier, president and CEO of SMI. Warren has held numerous other senior executive positions at Next Software (Apple), Continuum (Computer Sciences Corporation) and Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software.</p>\n\n<p>Warren holds a BS from Western Illinois University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0008/2289/82289v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2289/82289v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[302,182],"assets/images/resized/0008/2289/82289v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","firm":{"name":"Rearden Commerce","permalink":"reardencommerce","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/2779/2779v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/2779/2779v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0000/2779/2779v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Foundation Capital","permalink":"foundation-capital","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[59,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/0986/10986v3-max-150x150.png"],[[59,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/0986/10986v3-max-250x250.png"],[[59,68],"assets/images/resized/0001/0986/10986v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","firm":{"name":"Quantivo","permalink":"quantivo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/1297/31297v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/1297/31297v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,152],"assets/images/resized/0003/1297/31297v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
