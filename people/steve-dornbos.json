Through experience in the printing trade, training and education for our clients, we help businesses purchase their printing easily, efficiently and economically. </p>\n\n<p>Whether for a specific project or a general over-view of your printing requirements, we will provide a free evaluation which will help you determine if our services are right for you. </p>\n\n<p>We offer printing and related services, project consulting and staff training.</p>\n\n<p>As owners of Taylor Printing Company, Traverse Cityâ€™s oldest printing firm, my wife Veronica, and I brought new services to the area. Taylor Printing Company began offering foil stamping and blind embossing, the only printer in the area to produce these products in-house. </p>\n\n<p>Taylor Printing maintained itâ€™s reputation as a high quality printer offering unique services. We had a very loyal customer base, which we are still very grateful for and feel fortunate to have been able to serve. The business was sold to a local printer in 2008, at which time I spent the next year working with the new owner to ensure a smooth transition for its clients.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
