Ellen has known Mona for over 30 years and closely followed her capital marketsâ€™ and investor relations successes, and she quickly jumped on board Equidityâ€™s team to help bring its timely products and services to market, adding her expertise and commitment.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining Equidity, Ellen was in the private practice of law for 10 years in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C, focusing on business and tax law.  After private practice, Ellen went in-house with America Online (which later became AOL Time Warner) as Vice President of Tax Policy and Associate General Counsel where she lobbied on Capitol Hill for tax bills preventing taxation on internet access services, lobbied in Europe to prevent US companies from having to collect VAT on internet access services, represented AOL in meetings with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris to discuss VAT collection on internet access, negotiated with US state and county economic development partnerships to obtain tax incentives for AOL and handled a myriad of tax issues for the company.
