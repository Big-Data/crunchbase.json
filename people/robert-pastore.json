Educated in human nutrition, nutrigenomics, and biochemistry, he believes that every human being has a unique biochemical composition, ergo, varying nutritional needs.  As such, he designs nutritional plans for individuals based on their specific needs.  His advice has been sought for cases like allergies, detoxification, and celiac disease.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Pastore is well-recognized, having appeared on television, radio, and other forms of popular media to administer nutritional advice to the public.  His services are sought even by professional athletes from some of the biggest sports organizations in the country, like the NHL, NFL, and the NBA.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit his website, www.drrobertpastore.com.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/robertpastore11","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertpastore11","title":""}]}
