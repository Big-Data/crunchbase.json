His background is in starting up innovative companies from scratch, such as Flightlock — a travel safety company purchased by Control Risks, Finetoothâ€”a contract management solution, now doing business as Mumboe, and most recently the Texas Tribune — a non-profit, nonpartisan public media organization. H.O. brings his infectious passion and uncanny ability to predict the future to Umbel as he leads the team on a daily basis with one eye focused on battle tactics, one eye focused on Umbel&#8217;s long-term vision and one eye focused on his iPhone. H.O. studied electrical and biomechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0537/150537v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[208,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/0537/150537v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[375,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/0537/150537v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder","firm":{"name":"Umbel","permalink":"umbel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[364,364],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"The Daily Dot","permalink":"the-daily-dot","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Ricochet Labs","permalink":"ricochet-labs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0011/4692/114692v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0011/4692/114692v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,91],"assets/images/resized/0011/4692/114692v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Umbel","permalink":"umbel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[364,364],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/maycotte","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/maycotte","title":"Linked-In"},{"external_url":"http://umbel.com/about/team/","title":"Umbel"},{"external_url":"http://about.me/maycotte","title":"About.me"}]}
