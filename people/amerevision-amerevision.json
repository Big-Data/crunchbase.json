We apply fine-tuned underwriting, structuring and management processes to client files, enabling our  clients to resolve their disputes proactively, economically, and favorably.</p>\n\n<p>Amerevision selects cases for funding where the subject mortgage loan is defective, fraudulent or wrongfully-originated, whether the borrower is the plaintiff or defending a foreclosure.  Prior to application acceptance, we engage in a thorough analysis of a potential client’s real property and loan documentation, identifying flaws in mortgage origination, closing, servicing, securitizing and recording.</p>\n\n<p>Amerevision funds litigation by paying a client’s attorney directly for services performed.  Our funding is non-recourse, which means if a client is unsuccessful, we are not repaid the monies we have expended on their behalf.   We are paid only if a client settles their case successfully, and our fee can be paid in manageable monthly installments.</p>\n\n<p>We invest strategically in the success of our clients’ cases: our interests are entirely aligned with theirs.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Amerevision","permalink":"amerevision","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/giving-back/","title":"Amerevision Charity"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/investors/","title":"Investing in Amerevision"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/apply/","title":"Apply to Amerevision"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/recruiting/","title":"Apply for Amerevision Job"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/amerevision-team/","title":"Amerevision People"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/contact/","title":"Amerevision Contact"},{"external_url":"http://www.merchantcircle.com/business/Amerevision.800-445-2558","title":"Amerevision"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/amerevision-research?trk=ppro_cprof","title":"Amerevision Linkedin"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Amerevision","title":"Amerevision Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://attorneyjobs.com/employer/company/4428/Amerevision-Research-Llc","title":"Amerevision Attorney Jobs"},{"external_url":"http://www.whoisentry.com/domain/amerevision.com","title":"Amerevision Domain"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/Amerevision","title":"Amerevision Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://www.amerevision.com/amerevision-opportunity/","title":"Amerevision Opportunity"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/management/","title":"Amerevision Management"},{"external_url":"http://www.amerevision.com/real-estate-professionals/","title":"Amerevision for Real Estate Professionals"},{"external_url":"http://www.trulia.com/profile/Amerevision/","title":"Amerevision Trulia"}]}
