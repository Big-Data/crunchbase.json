Prior to founding Firespotter this January, Craig was Entrepreneur in Residence at Google Ventures, where he developed the idea of Firespotter Labs. A highly successful entrepreneur, Craig brought nearly a decade of experience in VoIP to GrandCentral Communications as CEO and co-founder. GrandCentral was acquired by Google in July 2007 (now Google Voice), where he became the Group Product Manager for the Real Time Communications Group responsible for Google Voice, Google Talk and Google Talk Video. In 2001, Craig became the CEO of Dialpad Communications, where he led the company out of bankruptcy and transformed it into the most profitable VoIP company in the industry. When Dialpad was acquired by Yahoo! in 2005 (now Yahoo! Voice), Craig became Senior Director of VoIP and successfully merged the team with the Yahoo! Messenger group. Prior to Dialpad, Craig was a technology venture investor at Sterling Payot Capital and TeleSoft Partners and was also a corporate attorney at top tier law firms in Silicon Valley, where he represented companies ranging from early stage start-ups to Cisco Systems.
