After researching and finding out how serious the issue was (25% of lorries run completely empty and 50% run only part-full), Robert set up Shiply in June 2008. By making use of spare capacity in delivery lorries, Shiply helps to cut down on wasteful journeys and CO2 emissions while at the same time saving the consumer up to 75% on their move.</p>\n\n<p>Shiply&#8217;s contribution to the environment has been recognised by a number of awards including Nectar Start Up of the Year, Startups Green Business of the Year 2009 and Postcode Lottery Green Challenge (with a â‚¬100,000 cash price awarded). Robert himself was also named Shell LiveWIRE Young Entrepreneur of the Year and BT Essence of the Entreprenuer.</p>\n\n<p>In his free time, Robert enjoys playing squash, snowboarding, sailing and windsurfing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/9618/89618v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/9618/89618v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/9618/89618v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSc","subject":"Management","institution":"University of Manchester","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Shiply","permalink":"shiply","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[145,145],"assets/images/resized/0019/0435/190435v2-max-150x150.png"],[[145,145],"assets/images/resized/0019/0435/190435v2-max-250x250.png"],[[145,145],"assets/images/resized/0019/0435/190435v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Shiply.com","permalink":"shiply-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0011/6294/116294v3-max-150x150.png"],[[201,60],"assets/images/resized/0011/6294/116294v3-max-250x250.png"],[[201,60],"assets/images/resized/0011/6294/116294v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
