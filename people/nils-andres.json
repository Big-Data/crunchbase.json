But rather than being a modern day Argonaut trying to slay his monster, Nils nurtures his kicking-and-screaming two-headed beast. His work on both sides of the research and academic spheres seeks to bring innovation and novel thinking to brand management approaches and to find new sales areas and functional direction for multinational brands.</p>\n\n<p>These brands encompass Fortune 100 companies in various industries, ranging from consumer goods to health care services. And the mission is always clear. It is to make brands and products more desirable. Nils is Associate Editor for practicing marketers of the Association of Consumer Research and is a Committee Member of INFORMS, the international scientific society. Nils and his team also launched hatebook. This scientific experiment is the first Social-Network experiment ever. He received a PhD in Marketing and in Psychology from the University of Hamburg.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"MyNeighborhood","permalink":"myneighborhood","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/2446/2446v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0000/2446/2446v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,152],"assets/images/resized/0000/2446/2446v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Brand Science Institute","permalink":"brand-science-institute","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0001/0911/10911v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/0911/10911v1-max-250x250.png"],[[262,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/0911/10911v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
