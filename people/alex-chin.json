These advocates were tasked with spreading the event&#8217;s marketing material using word of mouth and through personal brand-affiliation on social platforms. This marketing methodology ensured that a genuinely positive message was promoted to a highly-connected and local audience.</p>\n\n<p>As Alex&#8217;s network of commission-based sellers grew into the hundreds, the logistics of distributing physical tickets to these sellers became increasingly expensive. In addition, trying to pay advocates commission (based on their ticket-sales) was just too complicated. Alex tried to use current online ticket platforms to solve his problems however none sufficiently enabled the creation and tracking of multiple affiliate links. Therefore, Alex decided to create a &#8220;word-of-mouth marketing&#8221; application called &#8220;womapp&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Since it&#8217;s conception in 2008, womapp has now evolved to offer its users the ability to recommend a wider variety of products than just music event tickets. </p>\n\n<p>Alex hopes to socialise the online shopping experience using his real-world knowledge of creating sales teams from within social groups.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","firm":{"name":"womapp","permalink":"womapp","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/4622/204622v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0020/4622/204622v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0020/4622/204622v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/alexpchin","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/alexpchin","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/alexpchin","title":"Twitter"}]}
