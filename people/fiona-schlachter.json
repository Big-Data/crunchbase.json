After five years she transitioned to high tech product development where she worked with Sun Microsystems and McKesson for almost two decades.  </p>\n\n<p>In the summer of 2008 Fiona entered the startup world where she served as the Director of Operations for CleanLaunch, an incubator helping early stage clean technology companies, and then the Operations Lead at SnapImpact, an iPhone app that makes it easy to find nearby places to volunteer.  Once exposed to the startup scene, Fiona was hooked and in 2010 she established her own internet startup business where she could apply what she learned from her Fortune 200 career and try to maintain a healthy life/work balance. </p>\n\n<p>Fiona finds that balance in Boulder, Colorado where she lives with her Siberian husky Kita and her husband. Fiona did most of her undergraduate work at the University of Texas at Austin but holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Western Michigan University.
