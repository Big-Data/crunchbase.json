He got his first job as a teenager, writing security patches and modules for Linux kernel 2.0.x over 10 years ago. Since then, he looked for (and found) challenges in various fields - from creating custom billing and business support systems for leading Polish telcos, through performing computer security audits and penetration testing for high-profile companies and government institutions, all the way to designing and implementing microcontroller devices.</p>\n\n<p>For the last few years, he has been mainly focusing on companies and projects in their early stages. In 2004, Zbigniew became the first employee and CTO of a VoIP startup, in which he single-handedly designed the voice network, implemented his own billing and accompanying systems, and also hired and trained a small IT team.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007 he co-founded the leading Polish (and supposedly the largest European) microblogging platform, Blip.pl, and sold it to Gadu-Gadu S.A. (a subsidiary of Naspers, a NASDAQ-traded company).</p>\n\n<p>Father of a 5-year-old geek in training. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/7947/147947v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/7947/147947v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0014/7947/147947v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Member of the Board","firm":{"name":"Macoscope","permalink":"macoscope","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0007/2795/72795v2-max-150x150.png"],[[158,79],"assets/images/resized/0007/2795/72795v2-max-250x250.png"],[[158,79],"assets/images/resized/0007/2795/72795v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
