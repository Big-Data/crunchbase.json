He has published in such prestigious scientific journals as Nature, Current Biology, and Science. Dr. Messier is recognized as an authority on the use and interpretation of Ka/Ks algorithms. His research on the detection of molecular-level positive selection in the primates is well known. Dr. Messier also has carried out research to calculate dates of gene duplication in maize. Dr. Messier is currently collaborating with academic colleagues in several areas, including the role of molecular Darwinian selection in human speciation, creation of more powerful algorithms for the detection of molecular Darwinian selection, and the behavior of nuclear pseudogenes during primate evolution.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Evolutionary Genomics","permalink":"evolutionary-genomics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/5518/45518v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[97,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/5518/45518v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[97,120],"assets/images/resized/0004/5518/45518v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
