He&#8217;s worked in a variety of businesses, big and small, but alwaysÂ preferred the idea of being his own boss - the first consideration of any entrepreneur.Â  Andrew&#8217;s varied background includes financial services, IT recruiting, marketing, and sales.Â  When all is said and done,Â he likes the simplicity of helping people get what they want and knowing that their pleased with what his company, Sparkle Plenty Designs, Inc. has done for them.  </p>\n\n<p>An article about his business is here:</p>\n\n<p>Sparkly Shirts, the Bling that Keeps on Giving:\nby Andrew Sequeira:  </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t get noticed, you don&#8217;t have anything. You just have to be noticed, but the art is in getting noticed naturally, without screaming or without tricks.&#8221; Leo Burnett, marketing pioneer</p>\n\n<p>Makes sense, doesnâ€™t it?</p>\n\n<p>And itâ€™s not just the â€œgetting noticedâ€ part thatâ€™s critical to your business - how you get noticed and what it says about your business or brand is what stays with people.</p>\n\n<p>Which leads us to tee shirts, one of the most effective promotional tools. After all, we need to wear something, and if that something also promotes us in a way that we like, well, all the better. Considering that t-shirts have been promoting businesses and brands for over 50 years and counting, thereâ€™s obviously something to it.</p>\n\n<p>So, how effective are tee shirts for branding? Take a look through your closet and consider how many shirts you own with a designer label and think about how much money youâ€™ve paid those companies to advertise their brand! (Why do we keep doing that?)</p>\n\n<p>Also, consider this: according to current statistics, women account for 85% of all consumer buying decisions and as entrepreneurs, represent 70% of new business start ups. With all that decision making/buying power, itâ€™s well worth focusing on what women like.</p>\n\n<p>In the world of t-shirts, a growing part of that focus is the use of crystal and rhinestone components to create custom designs for small businesses, new product launches, clubs/teams, maternity/bridal wear, and even the current presidential campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it: women love sparkly things and they notice other women, particularly what theyâ€™re wearing. If your objective is to build some buzz around your business or a new product thatâ€™s focused on women, then a sparkly tee (think walking billboard) is one of the best ways to do it. Itâ€™s also a great look that generates compliments, and who doesnâ€™t want that?</p>\n\n<pre><code>                                  ~ ~ ~\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4294/34294v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/4294/34294v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[268,400],"assets/images/resized/0003/4294/34294v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Andrew Sequeira /  [Sparkle Plenty] (http://www.sparkle-plenty.com)</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
