Previously, he founded FastMail (sold to Opera Software) and Optimal Decisions (sold to ChoicePoint â€“ now called LexisNexis Risk Solutions). Prior to that he worked in management consulting, at McKinsey &amp; Company and A.T. Kearney.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremyâ€™s focus is applying algorithms to data. At FastMail he used algorithms to automate nearly every part of the business â€“ as a result the company only needed a total of 3 full time staff, and got over a million signups. Optimal Decisions was a business entirely built to commercialise a new algorithm he designed for the optimal pricing of insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremy competes regularly in data mining competitions, which he uses to test himself and stay on the leading edge of machine learning and predictive modelling technology. His competition performance history is available on his Kaggle profile page . </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0941/120941v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[176,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/0941/120941v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[318,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/0941/120941v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://evelynhoward.blogspot.com/\" title=\"Evelyn Howard\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evelyn Howard</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Chief Scientist","firm":{"name":"Kaggle","permalink":"kaggle","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0008/5693/85693v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0008/5693/85693v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,173],"assets/images/resized/0008/5693/85693v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"FastMail.FM","permalink":"fastmail-fm","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0008/6148/86148v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0008/6148/86148v1-max-250x250.png"],[[320,99],"assets/images/resized/0008/6148/86148v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Optimal Decisions Group","permalink":"optimal-decisions-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jeremyphoward","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=54272","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
