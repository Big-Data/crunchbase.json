My latest company is Chumly, which is an easier way to stay in control of multiple social networks and Chumly is itself a social website.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working with my father, also named John Gotts for nearly twenty years.  As he&#8217;s been involved in computer programming since the sixties the web proved a perfect place for us to come together as a team and we&#8217;ve been working together ever since, with our greatest financial success coming from selling anti-malware software since 2003.</p>\n\n<p>Living in Silicon Valley is a dream come true and really has placed me in the Mecca for technology and web startups.  I&#8217;m surrounded by brilliant minds and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be returning to Idaho in 2011 to start a campaign for the 2012 State Senate.  My goal is to bring the startup spirit of the greater Palo Alto area back to Idaho where I will do what I can to promote investment and incentives for new businesses that will in turn bring living-wage jobs.  The progress of that campaign will be highlighted on the http://electjohngotts.com website.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m blessed to work with twenty very bright people on the Chumly and we&#8217;re now going into our second year since actual idea on a napkin phase.  I&#8217;m proud to say that Chumly is one of the best projects I&#8217;ve been involved with, both on or offline.  It will be exciting to watch it grow this next year.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0681/100681v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,193],"assets/images/resized/0010/0681/100681v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[189,193],"assets/images/resized/0010/0681/100681v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/johnwgotts","title":"John Gotts on Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/johngotts","title":"John Gotts on LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/johngotts","title":"John Gotts on Flickr"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/john_gotts","title":"John Gotts on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://johngotts.tumblr.com","title":"John Gotts on Tumblr"}]}
