He has always had an instinct for identifying the next big thing.  In 1998 he raised over $10 Million in capital for a start-up called StockJungle.com that was the first online investment network that was used to create a real SEC Registered mutual fund.  Called the Community Intelligence Fund, it was able to earn a market beating track record, but the funds to operate the company ran out before the assets under management got big enough to support the business.  </p>\n\n<p>After StockJungle.com, he went on to bootstrap with two partners a new start-up called RightSide Advisors, that went on to become a moderately successful publisher of online investment research, newsletters and software tools.  RightSide was sold for a nice exit to a private equity firm in 2006.  </p>\n\n<p>Michael is married with 3 children and lives in the San Diego area.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0048/110048v2-max-150x150.png"],[[230,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/0048/110048v2-max-250x250.png"],[[277,300],"assets/images/resized/0011/0048/110048v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"History","institution":"UC Santa Barbara","graduated_year":1995,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Mob Science","permalink":"mob-science","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0018/1432/181432v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0018/1432/181432v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[257,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/1432/181432v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/granadabluestudios","title":""}]}
