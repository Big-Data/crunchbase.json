Having spent the majority of his career with these entrepreneurs, he knows what they need most in an investor: an experienced, valuable, and trustworthy partner. True strives to be this partner for every investment.</p>\n\n<p>Jonâ€™s long history with startups began in 1986 when he founded his first company, Mountain Bike Outfitters, Inc. Over the next several years, he would go on to co-found Chemdex Corporation with David Perry, now NexPrise Corporation (NASDAQ: NXPS), and Greenwich LLC, a streaming music company, which was acquired by iCast. Jonâ€™s direct startup experience means heâ€™s seen the world many times from the entrepreneurâ€™s point of view. This is where heâ€™s most at home, and his vision and insight make him the entrepreneurâ€™s confidant.</p>\n\n<p>At Summit Partners, Jon started his venture career as an associate where he focused on growth stage investments in the software industry. Jon also met and worked closely with True co-founder Phil Black at Summit. Jon then joined AOLâ€™s Greenhouse, the venture capital/incubator for AOL. These were the first days of the internet, and AOL was a fascinating place to see the market start.</p>\n\n<p>With the Internet just beginning, Jon jumped in early, joining CMGiâ€™s @Ventures group initially in 1996. @Ventures was the worldâ€™s first internet-only venture firm and, at the time, managed a whopping $25 million fund. The internet grew rapidly, and @Ventures grew along with it. By 2001, Jon was a Managing Partner, and the firm managed over $3 billion. His @Ventures deals include Critical Path (NASDAQ â€œCPTHâ€), Gamers.com, Hotlinks, Onelist/eGroups (acquired by Yahoo), Promedix (acquired by Ventro â€“ NASDAQ â€œVNTRâ€), and Ancestry.com (NASDAQ â€œACOMâ€).</p>\n\n<p>Jonâ€™s venture capital career spans 17 years and includes consistent early stage success. Before founding True, Jon was a Managing Director at Globespan, where he served on the boards of Copan Systems, FilmLoop, Glu Mobile (fka Sorrent), Ingrian Networks, Next Medium Networks, Nominum Corp., Plaxo, Sigma Dynamics, and Vazu.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/6182/66182v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0006/6182/66182v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[372,248],"assets/images/resized/0006/6182/66182v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>True
