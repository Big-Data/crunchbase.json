Not wanting to get a job, Michael started one of the first websites to sell new and used video games, one of his childhood passions. While â€œVideo Game Centralâ€ didnâ€™t make him rich, it hooked him on the idea of using the Internet to make money.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years later, while he was in high school, he began designing websites for his friends and family, and he turned his hobby into a business. Fluidesign was born, today an interactive agency based in Santa Monica that builds brands, creates websites, and markets clients online. The company has won many awards over the years and boasts some of the most well known companies around, such as AOL, SEGA, KCRW, USC, LMU, and World Vision.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, partnering with Fluidesign client and celebrity nursery designer Wendy Bellissimo, Michael co- founded Nesting.com, a portal for moms that helps them better manage and organize their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Michael has also been very active in the Los Angeles entrepreneur community, serving on the board of the Young Entrepreneurs Organization and advising the Southern California Entrepreneurship Academy. Michael is a frequent guest speaker at his alma mater, USC, where he regularly advises that â€œgrades do not equal success.â€</p>\n\n<p>In 2004 Michael received the Los Angeles County SBA Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. The following year he was voted as one of the â€œBest Entrepreneurs under 25â€³ by BusinessWeek, and syndicated to the front page of Yahoo! Finance. In 2008 Michael was noted as one of the â€œTop 20 in their 20â€™sâ€ by the Los Angeles Business Journal.</p>\n\n<p>Today he is a proud founder of Mobile Roadie, the simple and inexpensive way for anyone to build and manage their own iPhone and Android Apps.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0008/4780/84780v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,222],"assets/images/resized/0008/4780/84780v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,222],"assets/images/resized/0008/4780/84780v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Fluidesign","permalink":"fluidesign","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Mobile Roadie","permalink":"mobile-roadie","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0004/1979/41979v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0004/1979/41979v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,131],"assets/images/resized/0004/1979/41979v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://ideamensch.com/michael-schneider/","title":"Michael Schneider Interview on IdeaMensch"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.michaelschneider.com/","title":"Michael Schneider"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/msfd","title":"Twitter"}]}
