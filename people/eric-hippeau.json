In September 2006, Hippeau&#8217;s investment firm, Softbank Capital, was the first institutional investor in the Huffington Post, which was founded by Arianna Huffington and Kenneth Lerer in 2005. He started serving on the Board of Directors at the time of the investment.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining HuffPost, Hippeau was managing partner at Softbank Capital, a New York and Boston-based venture capital fund specializing in early stage investments in technology and digital media. He served on the board of Yahoo! from March 2, 1996 through April, 2011 and served on the boards of Geocities, CNET, Asia Global Crossing among others.</p>\n\n<p>Hippeau was also President of SoftBank International Ventures, where he established SoftBankâ€™s international private equity funds and expanded them into Europe, Latin America and Asia.</p>\n\n<p>Hippeau joined Softbank Capital in 2000 from Ziff-Davis, Inc., where he was Chairman and CEO. Ziff- Davis was the preeminent media company serving the technology industry, publishing leading computer magazines such as PC Magazine and Computer Shopper.

Hippeau was also responsible for founding ZDTV, a cable channel dedicated to technology and the Internet, and an early success in integrating television and the Web.
