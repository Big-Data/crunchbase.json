A former CTO, Ryan has made it his mission to change the world through an effective application of viral technologies and social networks.</p>\n\n<p>In 1995, at the young age of 26, Ryan Scott co-founded NetCreations, Inc., the first 100% opt-in e-mail marketing company. The traditional direct marketing industry resisted embracing opt-in, claiming it would hurt their industry. NetCreations countered by illustrating that ethical email marketing was profitable, sustainable, and defensible.</p>\n\n<p>With help from his business partner Rosalind Resnick, Ryan built NetCreations from a two-person Web design firm, to a $58 million (sales) public company in 2001. SEAT Pagine Gialle acquired NetCreations for $111 Million cash shortly thereafter.   Since then, Ryan has turned his knowledge of business and technology into the full-time passion of helping non-profits â€“ and their supporters â€“ to raise money and awareness.</p>\n\n<p>As a successful entrepreneur, Ryan continually applies the levers of capitalism to the problems of environmental degradation and social injustice. He currently holds investments in numerous Information Technology and Environmental Service companies including Signum Biosciences, Sierra Nevada Solar, Cool Earth Solar, T1ME, Mahalo, and Tesla Motors.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Ryan serves as an active member of the Keiretsu Forum, the President&#8217;s Council of Planned Parenthood, the Long Now Foundation, and the Methuselah Foundation, among others.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Scott lives in the greater Los Angeles area with his wife, Joanna.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/5289/25289v2-max-150x150.png"],[[142,210],"assets/images/resized/0002/5289/25289v2-max-250x250.png"],[[142,210],"assets/images/resized/0002/5289/25289v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder","firm":{"name":"Causecast","permalink":"causecast","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6100/16100v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/6100/16100v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/6100/16100v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO, Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"NetCreations","permalink":"netcreations","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":900000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Dipity","permalink":"dipity","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/8250/18250v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/8250/18250v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/8250/18250v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2007/10/08/wegame-stealthy-online-gaming-site-raises-half-a-million/","source_description":"WeGame, stealthy online gaming site, raises $500k","raised_amount":3000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"WeGame","permalink":"wegame","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0959/10959v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[203,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0959/10959v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[365,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0959/10959v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Causecast","permalink":"causecast","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6100/16100v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/6100/16100v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/6100/16100v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/simplehoney-launch/","source_description":"Cheezburger Creator Launches SimpleHoney To Find Hotels You’ll Love","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"SimpleHoney","permalink":"simplehoney","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0018/8725/188725v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0018/8725/188725v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0018/8725/188725v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blog.mixergy.com/ryan-scott/","title":"Mixergy Interview with Ryan Scott"}],"web_presences":[]}
