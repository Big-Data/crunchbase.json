Tom teamed up with Jay Bregman and 2 other co-founders.</p>\n\n<p>Tom left eCourier in &#8216;08 to set up Shutl.  Shutl which came out of stealth mode at Le Web in Dec &#8216;09 is a web-service that connects retailers to local courier firms enabling the retailers to offer their customers 90min delivery of online &amp; in-store purchases.  Shutl also lets customers choose to receive their purchases within a one hour time-slot of the consumerâ€™s choice 24/7.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, Tom was named â€œTop Gunâ€ by Growing Business magazine and eCourier was named â€œLondonâ€™s Most Inspirational Businessâ€ by the Evening Standard. Tom assists a number of early-stage start-ups. In 2008, eCourier was 53 on the Sunday Times Microsoft Tech Track 100. In 2009 eCourier reached 6 on Deloitteâ€™s list of UKâ€™s fastest growing technology businesses with 5291% growth since 2004.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of business, Tom is a founding trustee of FoundationStone, a charitable trust that invests in startup charities, and in his spare time he is a keen poker player and skier.</p>\n\n<p>Awards-\nâ€¢ Finalist in The Next Web Startup Competition, 10 (Shutl)\nâ€¢ Finalist in UK &amp; Ireland TechTour, 10 (Shutl)\nâ€¢ Co-winner (with Skimlinks) of Innovate!
