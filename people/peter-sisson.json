A consummate geek, he spent his early school years programming computers, running from bullies, and avoiding gym glass whenever possible.  He studied computer science at Cornell and went on to earn a masterâ€™s degree in computer science from Stanford.  He parlayed this into a job writing operating system software at Bell Labs, which soon after began its transition from a national institution to being owned by the French.  </p>\n\n<p>After a stint overseas doing volunteer work, Peter attended the Tuck School, where he began his transition to semi-normalcy and graduated with an MBA.   This led to jobs in management consulting at Arthur D. Little and equity research at Montgomery Securities.  </p>\n\n<p>He started his first company, WineShopper.com, in 1998, at the peak of the first Internet bubble.  WineShopper, funded by Kleiner Perkins and Amazon.com, was acquired by Wine.com in 2000. Since then, he has launched two successful companies, Mixonic (profitable but still private) and Teleo, a communications software company acquired by Microsoft in 2005. The latter being the better outcome, Peter is now working on another communications software company, Line2, which provides an app that lets customers add a new phone line to their Apple and Android devices.  </p>\n\n<p>Peter serves on the MBA Advisory Board of the Tuck School and is an advisor to StartOut and several start-up companies.  He lives in both San Francisco and New York.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/9556/39556v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9556/39556v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[447,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/9556/39556v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Cornell","graduated_year":1985,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MS","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Stanford","graduated_year":1987,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Tuck School","institution":"Dartmouth","graduated_year":1994,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Line2","permalink":"toktumi","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0003/1480/31480v9-max-150x150.png"],[[223,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/1480/31480v9-max-250x250.png"],[[223,84],"assets/images/resized/0003/1480/31480v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Director","firm":{"name":"Mixonic","permalink":"mixonic","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO and co-Founder ","firm":{"name":"Teleo","permalink":"teleo-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/7184/27184v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[104,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/7184/27184v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[104,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/7184/27184v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/petersisson","title":""}]}
