Dr. Kristian Hammond is currently on leave from his &#8220;day job&#8221; as a professor of Computer Science at Northwestern University.  He is an accomplished researcher in the areas of human-machine interaction, context-driven information systems and artificial intelligence.  After completing his Ph.D. in computer science at Yale University in 1986 and crafting the DARPA white paper that helped define and fund the field of Case-Based Reasoning, Kristian Hammond founded The University of Chicago&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Under his direction, the laboratory flourished as a center for innovative artificial intelligence research for more than a decade, funded by NSF, DARPA, ONR, AFOSR, the Whitaker Foundation, Apple Computer, McKinsey and Microsoft Research.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998, Professor Hammond and his students moved to Northwestern University&#8217;s Computer Science Department to form the Intelligent Information Laboratory (InfoLab). At the InfoLab, his team is creating technology that bridges the gap between people and the information they need. The InfoLab has focused on frictionless information systems that make use of a wide variety of user contexts to support and radically transform user experiences in the areas of information retrieval, media delivery, speech recognition, collaborative environments, news gathering, intelligent browsing and personalized recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>From 2000 to 2001, Dr. Hammond also enjoyed a run as the weekly technology correspondent for WTTW&#8217;s Chicago Tomorrow.  Dr. Hammond currently directs Northwestern&#8217;s InfoLab, and serves on Chicago Mayor Richard Daley&#8217;s Council of Technology Advisors.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hammond is driven by the desire to use the power of the network to give voice to those who struggle to be heard. His work with allvoices is a reflection of that desire.\nHe lives with his wife and two gorgeous boys less than a mile from Wrigley Field and that alone keeps him from leaving Chicago.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/4504/74504v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[135,201],"assets/images/resized/0007/4504/74504v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[135,201],"assets/images/resized/0007/4504/74504v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>AllVoices.com</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Philosophy","institution":"Yale University","graduated_year":1979,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Ph.D.","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Yale University","graduated_year":1986,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Narrative Science","permalink":"narrative-science","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0009/7129/97129v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,114],"assets/images/resized/0009/7129/97129v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,206],"assets/images/resized/0009/7129/97129v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Allvoices","permalink":"allvoices","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/whisperspace.twitter.com/whisperspace","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://khammond.blogspot.com/","title":"Blog"}]}
