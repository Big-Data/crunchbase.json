His Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of South Africa, where he majored in economics and finance, provides the foundation for making sound decisions in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>His fascination with mobile technology, however, overshadows his degrees and distinguishes him from those who are merely adept with handhelds. That Laurent has owned about 30 phones is not only research, itâ€™s how he gets his street cred. For fun, he teaches his latest mobile gadget new tricks. As a result, he is the first to know what the new â€œItâ€ technology is, well before itâ€™s â€œIt.â€ Indeed, â€œMobile fashionistaâ€ is the perfect moniker for Laurent, and one he accepts as a compliment.</p>\n\n<p>Laurentâ€™s career began at Hampton Securities in June 2002, where he served as a junior broker, carefully watching over and growing client funds. About three months after leaving Hampton Securities in 2003, Laurent went to an electronics expo in Hong Kong, looking for new products to sell in South Africa. It was a productive trip, largely because it was where that he conceived the idea of a VoIP-based international calling card. Upon his return from Hong Kong, idea-man-turned-entrepreneur created the card then sold his concept, growing the business and selling it on to a JSE-listed company.</p>\n\n<p>As a rule, Laurent is active on and up to speed with online technology forums. Not only does this activity fuel his passion, it keeps him well ahead of the curve, as science and technology transform the world into a true global village.</p>\n\n<p>Laurentâ€™s global perspective is now centered in New York, where he is joined by his BlackBerry, his iPhone and his wife.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and President","firm":{"name":"Beezag","permalink":"beezag","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/4624/74624v1-max-150x150.png"],[[229,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/4624/74624v1-max-250x250.png"],[[229,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/4624/74624v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"AdGenesis","permalink":"adgenesis","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0009/6155/96155v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0009/6155/96155v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[276,88],"assets/images/resized/0009/6155/96155v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
