His passion for computer technology started at an early age of 3.  At 13 he completed a COMPTIA A+ &amp; N+ a computing course primarily designed for the the older generation. At 14 he designed a network infrastructure that was virtually secure and up to the standards of the NSA. At 16 he was enrolled at UK IT training and completed his MCSA, he was later kicked from the course due to experimenting with the computers. It was later found that the course was moving to slow for Taz and he was enrolled back on a more advanced course which he later refused stating &#8220;there&#8217;s no point in me learning what I already know&#8221;. He has always taken great strides in learning and demands the best. </p>\n\n<p>After obtaining top GCSE marks in the country at 16, he got accepted to study at Kingston University were he studied Computer Security &amp; Forensics. He was the youngest in his class being only 17, he graduated first of his class. It was later discovered that he suffers from High Functioning Autism/Aspergers. Which explained a lot about his high intelligence in computers. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0002/1399/21399v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0002/1399/21399v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0002/1399/21399v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Taz Ryder</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA Hons","subject":"Computer Security and Forensics","institution":"Kingston University","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"HND","subject":"Electronic Engineering","institution":"Southampton Solent University","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Junior Communications Engineer","firm":{"name":"Nokia","permalink":"nokia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7958/17958v3-max-150x150.png"],[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7958/17958v3-max-250x250.png"],[[120,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/7958/17958v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Service Desk Engineer","firm":{"name":"NHS","permalink":"nhs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[65,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/1166/91166v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[65,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/1166/91166v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[65,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/1166/91166v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Project Lead Programmer","firm":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Microelectronics Service Engineer","firm":{"name":"AMD","permalink":"amd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"IT Specialist","firm":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"2nd Line Engineer","firm":{"name":"IBM","permalink":"ibm","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Desktop Support Engineer","firm":{"name":"Kinnetic","permalink":"kinnetic","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Microelectronics Service Engineer","firm":{"name":"Intel","permalink":"intel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Microelectronics Service Engineer","firm":{"name":"RISC Partners","permalink":"risc-partners","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
