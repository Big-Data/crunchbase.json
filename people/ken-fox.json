Ken is currently serving as the point person for Stripes Group&#8217;s investments in eMarketer, Sandata, Seamless, Turtle Beach, Epic Advertising, and Perimeter.</p>\n\n<p>Ken has been a successful entrepreneur, operator and investor in internet and branded consumer product companies for over 15 years.  Ken has started six companies (Internet Capital Group, ICG Asia, Stripes Group, Syndero, A10 Capital and the Sentinel Fund), led investments in over 35 companies and taken two companies he started public.  </p>\n\n<p>Prior to forming Stripes, Ken was a Managing Director of Internet Capital Group (NASDAQ:ICGE), which he co-founded in 1995.
