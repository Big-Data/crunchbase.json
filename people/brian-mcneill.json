Sometimes that salesperson is successful right away but usually not.  Sometimes the company will offer additional Sales Training or Sales Coaching. But without consistent Sales Coaching the salespersons learning curve is often longer than necessary.  The salesperson ends up frustrated, disillusioned, lonely, and mostly broke\nOr\nThe Contractor, who is really good at his or her service, decides to go into business for themselves but they only have a vague idea of how to sell it.  The Contractor often times goes into business with no Sales Training and no Sales Coaching so after they sell and service there current circle of friends and contacts they struggle.  Many Contractors mistakenly try to build a business by simply â€œundercutting each other.  There are better ways.\nOr\nA the Small Business Owner who is already wearing to many hats to effectively offer Sales Training or Sales Coaching to their people themselves.  Because of this, frustration often sets in.\nWhat we do is we bridge the gap.  We partner with the Salesperson, the Contractor, and the Small Business Owner to ensure that their sales and selling parts of their life is successful.\nOn the philosophy that two heads are better than one.
