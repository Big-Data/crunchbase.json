Leslie is the oldest son of mother (Evangeline) Mooi Leslie who is of Caribbean Dutch, Chinese, and African descent, and father Clement Leslie who is from Barbados and of Irish ancestry, raised in Trinidad.[citation needed] His parents were Salvation Army officers who frequently relocated for work. Ryan has lived in various states, cities, and countries. At an early age, Leslie taught himself how to play the piano under the guidance of Marc Styles. He developed the ability to recite music, as well as arrange chords to create songs.[2] At the age of 14, Leslie scored a 1600 on his SATs—a perfect score—while attending Bathurst High School, in Washington, DC.[3] In 1993, he applied to four University of California campuses as well as Stanford, Yale and Harvard. In his application essays he explained his interest in matriculating from his junior year in high school without having earned a diploma. He was accepted to all except Yale. He ultimately decided to attend Harvard College.[2] At the age of 19, Leslie graduated from Harvard with a degree in Government, concentrating in Political Science and Macroeconomics.[4] During his commencement ceremonies, Ryan delivered the prestigious Harvard Oration.[5]</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0016/5063/165063v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0016/5063/165063v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,256],"assets/images/resized/0016/5063/165063v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"World Pop Videos","permalink":"world-pop-videos","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[95,35],"assets/images/resized/0013/8824/138824v1-max-150x150.png"],[[95,35],"assets/images/resized/0013/8824/138824v1-max-250x250.png"],[[95,35],"assets/images/resized/0013/8824/138824v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"C.E.O.","firm":{"name":"Next Selection Lifestyle Group","permalink":"next-selection-lifestyle-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/ryanleslie","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.ryanleslie.com","title":"Website"}]}
