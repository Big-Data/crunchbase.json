Always in alignment with her natural strengths and wellness, she is a results-oriented, relationship-driven executive who brings out the best in her team and those she serves.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that healthy starts are pivotal in life, Julieâ€™s commitment to excellence and discipline finds its point of origin in classical ballet, the most methodical style of the genre, which she began studying and performing at age 4. Ballet fueled an artistic temperament and gave her a vehicle of expression through which her creativity blossomed. After college, Julie worked for the Pasadena Star News writing classified ads, theater and dance reviews and amassed an impressive written portfolio. After a turn at the Pasadena Art Center College of Design, she realized her forte was in writing and set her sights on the traditional public relations field. Since 1999, Julie has achieved extraordinary results in PR, SEO, digital and social media marketing.</p>\n\n<p>A self-proclaimed &#8220;visionary thinker&#8221; who knows her competencies, Julieâ€™s gift of forecasting market trends and customizing programs accordingly is her great differentiator. â€œI can work 18 months to 3 years ahead of mainstream thought,â€ she claims. Julie cites Softscribeâ€™s early deployment of keyword optimization, video marketing and social media strategies as &#8220;leading edge.&#8221; At the heart of her mission in business is a deep relationship orientation and dedication to helping her clients achieve their sales goals. Julie also embraces wellness principles and draws energy from positive, innovative people. &#8220;We have to be at our best to give our best.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/4548/164548v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[185,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/4548/164548v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[185,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/4548/164548v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Philosophy","institution":"The University of Texas at Austin","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Graphic Design","institution":"Art Center College of Design","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Post-Graduate Studies in Programming Fundamentals & UNIX","institution":"University of California, Berkeley","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Softscribe Inc.","permalink":"softscribe","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/7428/67428v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/7428/67428v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[447,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/7428/67428v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"450\" height=\"335\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yjWL2GRiaz4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yjWL2GRiaz4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"450\" height=\"335\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>1-minute video on Twitter: Are your customers there without you</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/juliesquires","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/Juliesquires","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/softscribeinc/","title":"Flickr"}]}
