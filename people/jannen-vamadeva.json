He spent five years working within strategy consulting and derivatives trading to accumulate enough capital to fulfil his dream of starting his own business.</p>\n\n<p>Jannen noticed first-hand how hard it was to see a GP. A growing number of people with busy lives or patients with mobility difficulties find it difficult to see a doctor. He also discovered that many clinical slots at NHS GP clinics were taken by patients with minor ailments - this led to longer waiting times for patients with more serious medical conditions.</p>\n\n<p>In addition the NHS is the largest UK public sector contributor to climate change. 21 million tonnes of CO2 are emitted each year, of which 3.6 million tonnes (16%) of emissions are from patients driving to NHS facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Jannen wanted to improve the aforementioned problems and designed a web-based interface that allowed patients to directly communicate with doctors. Anytime Doctor was born!</p>\n\n<p>Jannenâ€™s aim is to provide patients with online consultations and postal treatment for minor medical conditions thereby reducing waiting times and our carbon footprint. Anytime Doctor was only the second UK online doctor service to be authorised and regulated by the Care Quality Commission, the Governmental healthcare regulator.</p>\n\n<p>Find out more at: www.anytimedoctor.co.uk</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MEng","subject":"Chemical Engineering","institution":"Imperial","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director & Founder","firm":{"name":"Anytime Doctor","permalink":"anytime-doctor","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0015/1588/151588v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0015/1588/151588v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/1588/151588v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Credit Trading","firm":{"name":"Bear Stearns","permalink":"bear-stearns","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
