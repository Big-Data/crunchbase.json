Now part of an exploding team, made up of two young accomplished hot shots, a full time unflappable manager, and herself, the sage (or so they say).  Having partnered with this group over many years of building sales and marketing personalities, the group GROWS.  Ranked in the region, the plan is to outlast the bad market while adding new avenue streams.</p>\n\n<p>Communications and PR fall into Jude&#8217;s lap and writing has become the main function.  Both blogging about real estate and worldly interests show up on her various sites and in promotion of the EMG.  Savvy in placement, jude is on the hunt for what&#8217;s next, what&#8217;s funny, and what&#8217;s worthwhile.
