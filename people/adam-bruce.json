Adam has held previous positions of CEO for StreetFire.net, and President of Vidiac.com, which was merged into StreetFire in June of 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 14 years, Adam has held leadership, management, sales, and development roles at Internet start-ups and large technology companies.   His areas of expertise include e-learning, business continuity, online strategy, online media, outsourcing, managed services, and solution sales.   Adam has been part of the leadership team for 4 start-up companies (GCIC, E-Gold.com, BSI Consulting and StretFire.net) and has provided design and project management for more than $50M in government e-learning defense contracts (JIL, Amerind, ASC).  He has developed and sold more than $100M in complex telecommunications solutions for AT&amp;Tâ€™s largest Fortune 100 clients.</p>\n\n<p>Adam has been a part of the early founding membership, and moderation staff of, numerous automotive communities since 1994 including Usenet Firebird, Camaro, Mustangs (1994), Wj.net (later became F-Body.org, 1994), F-Body.com (1996), Corral (1996), CamaroZ28.com (1996), LS1.com (1997), LS1Tech.com (2000), and CorvetteForum.com (2000).</p>\n\n<p>StreetFire was conceived to provide service to and enrich the lives of the users of the aforementioned and other enthusiast communities and was launched in 2004 as the first video-sharing site on the Internet.  StreetFire created the paradigm for online video sharing later made popular by more generic video sites like YouTube (2005), Revver (2005), and Veoh (2006).  In 2005 StreetFire developed a white label video sharing service under the name Vidiac that became the forerunner for such popular services as Brightcove, VideoEgg, Ning and Kick Apps. </p>\n\n<p>Today StreetFireâ€™s video engine underlies more than 100 automotive communities and 1,000 other enthusiast sites and streams millions of videos every day from a library of hundreds of thousands of motor sport videos. StreetFire has relationships with tens of thousands of automotive video authors - from home enthusiasts to networks such as Fox SPEED channel, Torque TV, Next New Networks, 29HD, Kush TV, and United Pictures TV.</p>\n\n<p>Adam holds a B.S. from Florida State University in Graphic Design and Japanese Language and minors in Geology and Asian Studies.  He and his wife Carlisle now reside in Los Angeles after moving from Atlanta in 2007.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/5249/25249v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/5249/25249v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[242,320],"assets/images/resized/0002/5249/25249v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>CC</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Studio Art and Japanese Language","institution":"Florida State University","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"AutoStream","permalink":"autostream","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/9231/69231v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/9231/69231v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/9231/69231v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder and Chairman","firm":{"name":"StreetFire","permalink":"streetfire","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0002/3900/23900v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0002/3900/23900v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,215],"assets/images/resized/0002/3900/23900v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Vidiac","permalink":"vidiac","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/5215/25215v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/5215/25215v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,209],"assets/images/resized/0002/5215/25215v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/shinkaze","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://shinkaze.com/","title":"Adam's Blog"},{"external_url":"http://videos.streetfire.net/profile/Shinkaze.htm","title":"StreetFire Profile"},{"external_url":"http://www.myspace.com/shinkaze","title":"MySpace"},{"external_url":"http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=564135331&ref=name","title":"Facebook"}]}
