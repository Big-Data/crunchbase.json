Russell also helped to produce and bring on global sponsors for a nationwide college fashion show featuring Lauren Conrad from MTV&#8217;s The Hills. After CTI was sold, Russell moved back to San Diego to start MEYROW, Inc. - a digital agency specializing in revitalizing and empowering brands to empower others.</p>\n\n<p>After a successful stint in San Diego, Russell re-joined Zach Suchin and Jason Schutzbank in Los Angeles as Brand Knew&#8217;s VP of Brand Development.
