For example running a marathon, or when Hans Henrik got the idea to run to Paris - on roller skates. Or a 25 kilometer swim, which is not something you simply just do - it requires you can swim, has stamina, and that you live it out. </p>\n\n<p>Getting the idea is one thing, to implement - thatâ€™s something else, and sometimes a little crazy. Striving to get right out there where you donâ€™t quite know whether it make or break. It itâ€™s not the objective, but itâ€™s sometimes the result. </p>\n\n<p>Hans Henrik has been an entrepreneur since 1989 where he started his first business. Since the very beginning his been working in the intersection between technology, people and business. In different constellations. </p>\n\n<p>In recent years he challenged the limits in large companies - particularly in the financial sector, but also the design industry. It has given him a broad perspective on how business are managed and organized, but also the potentials and challenges when it comes to coping with challenges of the 21. century</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/0911/90911v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/0911/90911v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/0911/90911v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master","subject":"Change Management, Social Media & Innovation","institution":"Copenhagen Business School","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Wosju","permalink":"wosju","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/3651/113651v2-max-150x150.png"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/3651/113651v2-max-250x250.png"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/3651/113651v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner, co-founder","firm":{"name":"Wemind","permalink":"wemind","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,17],"assets/images/resized/0003/5698/35698v2-max-150x150.png"],[[116,17],"assets/images/resized/0003/5698/35698v2-max-250x250.png"],[[116,17],"assets/images/resized/0003/5698/35698v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner, co-founder","firm":{"name":"Fourmation","permalink":"fourmation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/1777/91777v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,249],"assets/images/resized/0009/1777/91777v2-max-250x250.png"],[[273,272],"assets/images/resized/0009/1777/91777v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"400\" height=\"225\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7945530&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7945530&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></embed></object><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7945530\">Hans Henrik on \"Shifts\" in Business</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/publicmind\">Hans Henrik Heming</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Hans Henrik on &#8220;shifta&#8221; in business - in danish</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/publicmind","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://dk.linkedin.com/in/hanshenrikheming","title":"LinkedIN"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/publicmind/","title":"Flickr"}]}
