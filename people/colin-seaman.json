The site achieved 10 million visitors per month and was one of the moment successful fan sites for any football club on the internet. The success of the site ensured an advertising sponsorship deal with Future Publishing and gave Colin the chance to write Total Footballâ€™s 1999 pre-season feature.</p>\n\n<p>Colin has had extensive experience in both the e-learning sector and in trade finance, meaning that he has proven development skills suited for creating secure, high user level website development.
