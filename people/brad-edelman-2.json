He squandered much of his childhood programming his Apple ][+ and endured many years of &#8220;geek ridicule&#8221; before the Internet managed to make computers cool. Brad was the CTO/co-founder of PlayFirst, the pioneering casual games publisher (go Diner Dash!), and the creator of the Indy hit game, Triclops. Prior to PlayFirst, Brad drank Diet Coke while his fingertips typed the code that added video to Macromedia Flash. He also worked on several versions of Adobe PageMill. Brad holds twelve patents and a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Fingerprint ","permalink":"fingerprint","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0015/1367/151367v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0015/1367/151367v2-max-250x250.png"],[[325,156],"assets/images/resized/0015/1367/151367v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"PlayFirst","permalink":"playfirst","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0000/2767/2767v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0000/2767/2767v4-max-250x250.png"],[[297,86],"assets/images/resized/0000/2767/2767v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
