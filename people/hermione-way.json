Having graduated as a journalist (and even before graduating, completing a National Council for the Training of Journalists qualification; something usually taken as a post-graduate) Hermione has shown an impressive track record of establishing innovative businesses in the new media space.</p>\n\n<p>She started her first venture, Newspepper.com in the second year of her degree, using money from her student loan to buy the first piece of equipment. Newspepper began essentially as a â€œcitizen journalismâ€ video production company with one key difference; it employed student and graduate filmmakers and journalists enabling them to get much-needed paid vocational media work experience. Having had substantial experience of working for media organisations whilst at University, Hermione opted not to take a position with another employer, but rather to seek to take the Newspepper concept and turn it into a profitable business model, whilst ensuring it remained true to the founding principle of providing vocational training. By focussing solely on the production of video content designed for the internet, Newspepper is able to offer its clients a unique proposition. Firstly the costs associated with online distribution are significantly lower than those for conventional video, partly because the â€œtransmissionâ€ costs are lower, but also because the quality of footage required is not as high as for traditional video presentation, enabling the use of cheaper (and more portable) recording equipment. Secondly, it provides significant flexibility in terms of how the content is distributed, ranging from live (uncut) â€œstreamedâ€ footage of events to more formal pre-recorded content.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Newspepper offers its clients extensive expertise in exploiting the viral nature of the internet (such as the use of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook) to ensure their video content receives the widest possible exposure. It is thanks to the unique business model which Hermione developed, that has allowed Newspepper, in a very short space of time, to build up an impressive client base which includes the BBC, Channel 4, BT and a number of government departments. On its own, Newspepper is highly impressive. However, it is a measure of her determination and drive that Hermione not only runs her own production company, but has also established herself as an online journalist in her own right. Her latest venture, Techfluff.tv is an online video channel which reports on European Internet culture in a light-hearted irreverent manner. The channel, which has Hermione as its anchor presenter, uses a team of local correspondents from across Europe and reports on technology and social media developments.</p>\n\n<p>Targeted at people interested in and active in the European technology sector, in less than a year it has already built up a cult following of 35,000 viewers a month, and an ancillary audience on Twitter of 18,000. In addition to its remit of providing news, it also has an entrepreneurial focus and includes an opportunity for entrepreneurs to present their ideas to investors in a regular online â€œelevator pitchâ€ feature.</p>\n\n<p>Techfluffâ€™s video content has been licensed to the Daily Telegraph and partnerships have been struck with a number of technology sites. Techfluff is not only a viable business in its own right, it also serves as a showcase for Newspepper and Hermione herself.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to her business activities, Hermione is active in promoting entrepreneurship and encouraging more women to become involved in technology. In a very short space of time she has become a leading figure in new media and internet startups in London and globally. In addition to her wide-ranging online broadcasting activities where she regularly produces content on a range of issues, she regularly appears on Sky News as an internet commentator.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0009/9944/99944v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0009/9944/99944v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0009/9944/99944v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Hermione Way</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Newspepper","permalink":"newspepper","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0000/3217/3217v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0000/3217/3217v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,317],"assets/images/resized/0000/3217/3217v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"igniteHealth","permalink":"ignitehealth","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"450\" height=\"283\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Va12S_MUehE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>tnw stuff</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/hermioneway","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/hermioneway","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/hermioneway","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/112281266291961431580","title":"Google+"}]}
