In this role, Durchslag will take the helm of BestBuy.com, the world’s 11th largest online retailer. </p>\n\n<p>Durchslag leads the company’s overall strategy to advance Best Buy’s global e-commerce vision, retail multi-channel capabilities and online business development. He will be responsible for all of Best Buy’s global e-commerce channels, including BestBuy.com and mobile commerce. \n&#8220;Scott’s arrival at Best Buy signals our determination and commitment to create a world class customer experience - both online and in our stores,&#8221; said President and CEO Hubert Joly. &#8220;It also demonstrates our continuing ability to attract world class talent like Scott.”</p>\n\n<p>“I am very excited to have Scott on the Best Buy team and leading a critical growth area of our Best Buy business,” said Gillett. “He’s a seasoned tech veteran whose passion, talent and experience will add tremendous value to Best Buy as we build upon the broader digital and online experience for our customers.” </p>\n\n<p>“I am excited to be part of the transformation at Best Buy,” said Durchslag. “The company is uniquely positioned to deliver an innovative digital experience that provides the ‘best buy’ for consumers in price, convenience and services, using both clicks and bricks.”</p>\n\n<p>Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) is the leading multi-channel global retailer and developer of technology products and services. It has 167,000 employees delivering technology solutions that generate approximately $50 Billion in revenues.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining Best Buy, Durchslag was President of Expedia Worldwide, the world’s largest online travel agency. He was responsible for managing the overall strategy, product development, marketing and operations of its 28 sites around the world with a focus on increasing its global footprint and driving innovation to gain share. He was the primary architect for the Expedia 3.0 strategy and led the migration to its new platform.  Expedia grew to 50 million unique visitors per month and conversion improved significantly resulting in 25% year on year growth in hotel nights and revenue. This contributed to Expedia Inc&#8217;s stock price doubling year on year. Scott had full responsibility for Expedia Worldwide&#8217;s P&amp;L, which is tens of billions of dollars in Gross Booking Value and several billion in revenue. </p>\n\n<p>Scott was Chief Operating Officer of Skype from 2008-10 and was based in Europe. While Skype was owned by eBay, his mission was to drive profitable growth to scale the company by doubling revenues, users, and minutes while building the required supporting structures, processes, and operating rhythms. This was accomplished and Skype was successfully sold to a consortium led by Silver Lake Partners. Scott launched Skype&#8217;s mobile business with the first iPhone, Android, and Symbian products together with ground-breaking partnerships with Verizon Wireless, Apple, and Nokia. He also launched Skype for Business through a new VAR channel in the United States and United Kingdom. Scott led the marketing of these initiatives, along with new releases of Skype&#8217;s core Windows and Apple clients, through Skype&#8217;s first television commercials, The Oprah Winfrey Show, CNN, ESPN, and Who Wants to be a Millionaire together with a set of highly integrated online marketing programs.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Skype, Scott held a series of top leadership positions in product, sales, marketing, and strategy within Motorola Mobile Devices from 2002-2007 and did enterprise software start-ups in Silicon Valley. He was elected a partner with McKinsey &amp; Company in only four years and served technology clients in New York, Greater China, and Southeast Asia.  He graduated phi beta kappa from the University of Chicago and received his MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/5217/115217v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/5217/115217v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/5217/115217v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"General
