He is also an inaugural member of the Thomson Technicolor fellowship program in recognition of his contributions to the company’s intellectual property portfolio and ongoing innovation.</p>\n\n<p>He parlayed this position through pivotal work as the co-founder and CEO of SyncCast, where the technologies and services developed under his guidance powered the digital offerings of distinguished companies including Microsoft, Billboard, Warner Music Group, The Motion Picture Association of America, Lionsgate Entertainment, NBC Universal, EMI Music Group and DIRECTV.</p>\n\n<p>The role Lance played at SyncCast in launching Microsoft’s Xbox Video Market Place brought the end-to-end electronic fulfillment assets of the company to bear as Xbox captured the second highest market share in the video download space over the course of a few short months. This success subsequently caught the attention of Technicolor which acquired SyncCast in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Lance’s career in advanced media technology began at venture-funded Voxel where he served as the director of technology. Subsequent to Voxel, Lance founded WareNet Inc., an early SaaS leader in outsourced infrastructure.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/7206/217206v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[171,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/7206/217206v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[308,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/7206/217206v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Imaging Science","institution":"Rochester Institute of Technology","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"WareNet","permalink":"warenet","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"SyncCast","permalink":"synccast","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","firm":{"name":"Cenoplex","permalink":"cenoplex","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0021/5603/215603v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,55],"assets/images/resized/0021/5603/215603v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,55],"assets/images/resized/0021/5603/215603v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer, DSC Platform","firm":{"name":"Technicolor","permalink":"technicolor","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-150x150.png"],[[201,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-250x250.png"],[[201,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"Orange County Homeland Security Advisory Council","permalink":"orange-county-homeland-security-advisory-council","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Technology","firm":{"name":"Voxel","permalink":"voxel-dot-net","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/6583/26583v2-max-150x150.png"],[[106,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/6583/26583v2-max-250x250.png"],[[106,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/6583/26583v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal Instigator","firm":{"name":"Ware Holdings","permalink":"ware-holdings","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"SyncCast, Inc.","permalink":"synccast-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technology Officer ","firm":{"name":"Voxel","permalink":"voxel-dot-net","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/6583/26583v2-max-150x150.png"],[[106,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/6583/26583v2-max-250x250.png"],[[106,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/6583/26583v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technology Officer, DSC Platform","firm":{"name":"Technicolor","permalink":"technicolor","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-150x150.png"],[[201,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-250x250.png"],[[201,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP of Technology","firm":{"name":"Technicolor","permalink":"technicolor","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-150x150.png"],[[201,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-250x250.png"],[[201,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/6297/66297v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"WareNet, Inc.","permalink":"warenet-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Inaugural Distinguished Fellow,\r\nThomson Technicolor -\r\nRecognized for expertise in the areas of digital content delivery, content protection and encoding, as well as contributions to the company's intellectual property and commercialization of the same.","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Lance","last_name":"Ware","permalink":"lance-ware"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.cenoplex.com/in-the-news/the-future-is-calling/","title":"TMCnet Guest Editorial: The Future is Calling"},{"external_url":"http://www.cenoplex.com/press/cenoplex-announces-new-chief-technology-officer/","title":"Cenoplex Announces New Chief Technology Officer"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/lanceware","title":"LinkedIn - Lance Ware"}]}
