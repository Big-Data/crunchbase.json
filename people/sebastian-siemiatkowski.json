Apart from that he has also always dreamed about starting a company but while full of ideas but never managed to come about it, until he met with Victor and Niklas. He started Klarna in 2005, together with the two friends <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/niklas-adalberth\" title=\"Niklas Adalberth\">Niklas Adalberth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/victor-jacobsson\" title=\"Victor Jacobsson\">Victor Jacobsson</a>, during his studies at the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.se/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"Stockholm School of Economics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stockholm School of Economics</a>. Besides from that he and Niklas have also traveled around the world without flying.</p>\n\n<p>The idea for the company was founded during a business idea competition hosted by the Stockholm School of Economics and its partners. Sebastian and his friends managed to go to the final and pitched the idea in front of Sweden&#8217;s greatest investors and businessmen. They were rejected by all the &#8216;dragons&#8217; and lost the final. But they kept their belief of one day becoming a great company and started Klarna (then Kreditor) anyway. Klarna has quickly expanded to become one of Europe&#8217;s leading payment solutions provider, with support from <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/sequoia-capital\" title=\"Sequioa Capital\">Sequioa Capital</a> and Investment AB Ã–resund. </p>\n\n<p>Sebastian has a masters degree from the Stockholm School of Economics. Sebastian was together with Niklas and Victor awarded &#8220;Ã…rets manliga stjÃ¤rnskott&#8221; by Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the year region Stockholm in 2009.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/9077/99077v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[186,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/9077/99077v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[335,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/9077/99077v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Klarna","permalink":"klarna","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0008/6017/86017v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0008/6017/86017v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,120],"assets/images/resized/0008/6017/86017v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zRNkf5HIe_U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/i6u_ym6ox8U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Sebastian Siemiatkowski at SU Innovation part 1 </p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/77TEush_ugw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Sebastian Siemiatkowski at SU Innovation part 2</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.economist.com/node/18396166","title":""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/klarnasebastian","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2397824","title":""}]}
