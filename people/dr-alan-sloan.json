Dr. Sloan together with Dr. Michael Barnsley was a pioneer in developing and patenting fractal digital compression technology. </p>\n\n<p>In 1987, Dr. Sloan co-founded Iterated Systems, Inc. (“Iterated”) with Dr. Barnsley to create a business to develop and market fractal image compression technology. In 1992, Iterated signed a comprehensive license agreement with TMMI by which TMMI acquired the rights to use and develop Iterated’s fractal source codes VDK1.0 to 1.4. While with Iterated, Dr. Sloan also developed grant applications and was a principal involved in a number of Defense Department contracts to develop an early PC based video phone for the Army based on their SINCGARS mobile radios and a high speed video compression board for the Air Force to use in a sensor testing lab. Dr. Sloan led a project to develop a low complexity, low bit-rate videophone codec for Mitsubishi. He negotiated a multi-year contract with MCI which included the development of a high frame rate, low bit-rate, and low latency videophone codec.</p>\n\n<p>In the mid 90’s, Dr. Sloan joined ANSI L3 and MPEG 4 standards groups and formed a cooperative effort with MCI regarding MPEG 4. He is an inventor on several issued fractal image compression patents. Iterated was renamed Media Bin and went public in Norway in the mid 90’s. Dr. Sloan left Media Bin in 2002 and patented a new image recognition technology. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"","institution":"MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Ph.D","subject":"Mathematics","institution":"Cornell University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"PostDoctoral Fellowship","subject":"","institution":"Carnegie-Mellon University ","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board Specializing in Fractal Technology & Patenting","firm":{"name":"TMMI (TMM Inc.)","permalink":"tmm-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0018/6335/186335v10-max-150x150.png"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0018/6335/186335v10-max-250x250.png"],[[250,67],"assets/images/resized/0018/6335/186335v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Iterated Systems Inc.","permalink":"iterated-systems-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Faculty","firm":{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology","permalink":"georgia-institute-of-technology","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"ANSI L3","permalink":"ansi-l3","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Media Bin ","permalink":"media-bin","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Faculty - Visiting Position","firm":{"name":"Princeton University Investment Company","permalink":"princeton-university-investment-company","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"MPEG 4 Standards Group","permalink":"mpeg-4-standards-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_compression","title":"Fractal Compression - Dr. Alan Sloan, Iterated Systems Inc."},{"external_url":"http://tmmi.us/news_2012-02-29.html","title":"TMMI - Dr. Sloan joins Advisory Board"}]}
