Summers were spent as a deckhand on his family’s commercial fishing boat; and winters were divided between school, snowboarding and teaching himself how to write code.</p>\n\n<p>In 2000 Arron moved to the “Lower 48” to study math, computer science and Cultural Anthropology at Western Washington University. An economic downturn in the commercial fishing industry prompted Arron to “dropout” of college and start Kalbay Systems, a web-based application development firm. Arron has been working in tech ever since.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007 Arron moved to Boulder, Colorado to participate in TechStars, a mentorship-driven seed stage investment fund. In 2008 Arron co-founded Olive Interactive, LLC. Olive Interactive built and released two products called Claim.io and DandyID, which offered social media identity management services to businesses and brands respectfully.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009 VaynerMedia, a social media agency co-founded by Gary Vaynerchuk, took an equity position in Olive Interactive. This provided Arron with the opportunity to work with Gary out of VaynerMedia&#8217;s New York office throughout 2010. In 2011 Claim.io and DandyID were both acquired by a Canadian tech company.</p>\n\n<p>Arron&#8217;s firsthand experience being raised in a rural fishing community, combined with his intense interest in computer science and cultural studies provide much of the inspiration that he now applies toward Toutd.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0003/0970/30970v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0003/0970/30970v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0003/0970/30970v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / CTO","firm":{"name":"Tout'd","permalink":"toutd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,50],"assets/images/resized/0018/6351/186351v2-max-150x150.png"],[[130,50],"assets/images/resized/0018/6351/186351v2-max-250x250.png"],[[130,50],"assets/images/resized/0018/6351/186351v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Board Member","firm":{"name":"Localcents, Inc.
