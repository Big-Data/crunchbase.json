By age 14 he began writing in the C programming language. Intrigued by the internetworking, he spent that summer at a Cisco lab learning to build networks. His first exposure to professional software development came as Protege to Mark Allen, Chief Programmer at D.C. startup L7 Apps followed by an internship on the exclusive Fedora Manhattan Project where he was introduced to open source software development.</p>\n\n<p>Career:\nAJ Jaghori is the Chief Technology Officer of Mobile Development at L-3 Communications STRATIS where he builds enterprise mobility products for the government. He serves as Executive Council on the Board of Directors at The Open Source Software Institute and is a Mentor at Google (Summer of Code).  Previously, AJ founded Cambridge, MA based startup The Social Genome Project, GenSomatic (D.C.), and IPcerts (San Francisco).  He has also served in leadership roles at Verizon, Google, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. AJ had a 3 year tenure as a Technical Instructor at the Cisco Networking Academy.  </p>\n\n<p>Conflict:\nIn late 2008, a conflict surfaced with a check-in algorithm between AJ and the location-based mobile company FourSquare (details and resolution remain discrete). He has since been closely aligned and a supporter of Gowalla.     </p>\n\n<p>Industry:\nA frequent keynote speaker, AJ combines humor with demos to captivate audiences in the social, mobile, health, and networking domains.  He is also an active figure in the bi-coastal startup communities.</p>\n\n<p>Philanthropy:\nAJ continues to serve as a technology philanthropist by building products for non-profit organizations.  In March 2011, he ran a social media campaign to raise charity proceeds for the young wounded veterans of Rivers of Recovery in collaboration with West Coast rock band Camp Freddy. AJ is presently working on an Allergy Push Notification platform with the American Academy of Pediatrics set to launch as a free mobile service in Spring 2013.      </p>\n\n<p>Accolades:\nAJ has received numerous technology accolades and continues to surge as an elite technologist.  In July 2011, Computer World Magazine called him a &#8220;new hero&#8221; and said that his &#8220;transformational&#8221; social media application, iLiger, &#8220;may very well create the next social wave.&#8221;  </p>\n\n<p>Personal:\nAJ lives in Northern Virginia with his wife and son and is an active member of the U.S. Coast Guard. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/4919/164919v2-max-150x150.png"],[[129,181],"assets/images/resized/0016/4919/164919v2-max-250x250.png"],[[129,181],"assets/images/resized/0016/4919/164919v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>AJ Press Image -
