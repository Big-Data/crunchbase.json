Joel didnâ€™t set out to be an entrepreneur; he developed the first version of Bomgarâ€™s remote support software in 2003 while working part-time as a field systems engineer and completing his Bachelorâ€™s degree. He was frustrated that the majority of his time was spent incurring non-billable hours as he drove from one client site to the next, and he began looking for a way to provide technical support remotely. When one didnâ€™t exist, he invented it. </p>\n\n<p>Since Bomgarâ€™s founding in 2003, Joel has led the company to acquire more than 5,500 customers in 65 countries around the world.  Bomgar today has offices in Atlanta, San Francisco, Colorado, Florida, Texas, Washington DC, Virginia, London and Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous awards, including Deloitteâ€™s Fast 500 in 2007-2010, and Inc. Magazineâ€™s Inc. 500 in 2008 and 2009, have recognized Bomgarâ€™s rapid growth. Joel has appeared on programs such as ABC News&#8217; &#8220;Ahead of the Curve&#8221; and in publications, including The Wall Street Journal, CIO Today, Inc. Magazine, Entrepreneur.com and BNET. </p>\n\n<p>In 2009, Joel was a finalist for the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Houston and Gulf Coast Area Program. He was also named Mississippian of the Year by the Association of Information Technology Professionals in 2010. Joel is a member of the Young Presidents&#8217; Organization, the world&#8217;s largest network of company Presidents and CEOs.</p>\n\n<p>A native of Jackson, Joel continues to live in the area with his family. He earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in business administration from Belhaven College and served in the Mississippi Air National Guard where he honed his networking and computer skills, earning more than 16 network certifications. Prior to founding Bomgar, Joel worked as a senior network engineer for Business Communications, Inc. (BCI), a systems integrator, where he was responsible for providing technical support and assistance to all of BCI&#8217;s customers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0004/1790/41790v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,183],"assets/images/resized/0004/1790/41790v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,330],"assets/images/resized/0004/1790/41790v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Bomgar Corporation</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor's Degree ","subject":"Business Administration","institution":"Belhaven College","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Founder","firm":{"name":"Bomgar","permalink":"bomgar","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0004/1036/41036v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0004/1036/41036v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,187],"assets/images/resized/0004/1036/41036v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Mississippian of the Year by the Association of Information Technology Professionals","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"Bomgar","permalink":"joel-bomgar"}},{"description":"Finalist, Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2009 Award, Houston and Gulf Coast Area Program","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"Bomgar","permalink":"joel-bomgar"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bnet.com/blog/smb/a-new-brand-name-changed-everything/3193","title":"A New Brand Name Changed Everything BNET "},{"external_url":"http://www.foxsmallbusinesscenter.com/entrepreneurs/2010/10/18/successful-strategies-business-mentor/","title":"3 Successful Strategies to Find a Business Mentor Fox Business "}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.bomgar.com/leadership.htm","title":"Bio"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/JoelBomgar","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://blog.tmcnet.com/telecom-crm/2009/01/19/qa-with-joel-bomgar-bomgar-corp-ceo-founder.asp","title":" Q&A With Joel Bomgar, Bomgar Corp.
