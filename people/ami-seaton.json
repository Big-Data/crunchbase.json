With a degree in Marketing Communications from BCIT, Ami is also an entrepreneur. Amiâ€™s past and present success as an event producer allowed him to create a massive global social network. </p>\n\n<p>After a decade in event and concert production business as well as the development and management of nightclubs, it was partly by chance that he started looking at the womenâ€™s fashion industry. â€œIf I wasnâ€™t in the music business, I would be involved in the fashion business.â€ says Ami. </p>\n\n<p>In 2007 he was an investor in a lingerie company line called Love is Heaven, and ended up taking over the business in 2008. After re-structuring the entire company from manufacturing through to distribution and retail, Ami realized with some sound advice of his friend Harry, the best path to the market was direct to the consumer via Internet retail. The rest is to be written in the history books!</p>\n\n<p>Amiâ€™s position, roles and responsibilities at Rupaz include being part of the executive team, product management, event production, media relations and model casting.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/2568/102568v6-max-150x150.png"],[[203,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/2568/102568v6-max-250x250.png"],[[352,432],"assets/images/resized/0010/2568/102568v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business Development","firm":{"name":"Rupaz","permalink":"rupaz","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0009/9318/99318v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0009/9318/99318v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,175],"assets/images/resized/0009/9318/99318v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
