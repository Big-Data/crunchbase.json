In 2011, The Decathlon established a partnership with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.  The Decathlon has been featured on CNBC, Bloomberg, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Dealbreaker.com.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, Maloney co-founded CharityBets which expands The Decathlon&#8217;s performance-based fundraising model.  CharityBets realigns the relationship between a donor and competitor by facilitating donations which are determined by how well, or how poorly, a competitor performs in an athletic event relative to the competitor&#8217;s defined performance goal.  Using an abbreviated version of CharityBet&#8217;s donating option, The Decathlon has raised over $325,000 since 2009, an average of $9,000 per competitor.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/0605/150605v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0015/0605/150605v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0015/0605/150605v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Dave Maloney</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Communications","institution":"Auburn University","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Financial Advisor","firm":{"name":"Morgan Stanley","permalink":"morgan-stanley","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[237,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[237,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.thedecathlon.org","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.charitybets.org","title":""}],"web_presences":[]}
