Shawn went into a local rental company with excitement to rent a snowmobile for the day at a price of $325 for the day. The problem came when he asked about insurance, answer was no rental insurance. He thought three things were wrong, one high price for a 8 hour rental, second no insurance, and third the rental process was old fashioned. Shawn did not rent the snowmobile that day instead he focused his efforts in changing the rental market. </p>\n\n<p>Shawn Gardner in Forbes.com: http://www.forbes.com/sites/actiontrumpseverything/2012/09/22/how-the-best-entrepreneurs-succeed-a-case-study/2/</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/5978/145978v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,186],"assets/images/resized/0014/5978/145978v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,336],"assets/images/resized/0014/5978/145978v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/actiontrumpseverything/2012/09/22/how-the-best-entrepreneurs-succeed-a-case-study/2/","title":"Shawn in Forbes.com"},{"external_url":"http://fun2rent.com/","title":"Fun2Rent-website"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/fun2rent","title":"Shawn-Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/fun2rent","title":"Fun2Rent-Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/Shawn_Fun2rent","title":"Shawn-Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Fun2Rent","title":"Fun2Rent-facebook"}]}
