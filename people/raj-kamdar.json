Born in Ahmedabad on June 26th 1996, he started going into tech since he was 7. At age of 9, he started his first blog named &#8220;Godfather Of All&#8221;. It was just a timepass and useless blog.</p>\n\n<p>Then, a year later, he started a site with &#8220;Me&#8221; which later changed it&#8217;s name to &#8220;Snappville&#8221;. The site intended Social Networking and was named &#8220;Cechaters&#8221;. </p>\n\n<p>He passed a couple of years making useless sites until in his 8th grade, he made &#8220;Bollywood N Masala&#8221;, a bollywood blog. The blog got quite nice due to it&#8217;s copy-paste content!! </p>\n\n<p>Again, for a couple of years, because of no internet connectivity, he didn&#8217;t make too many sites. On reaching 11th grade, he got intyernet connectivity at home first time in September 2011. Since then, his blog BNM (Bollywood N Masala) flourished. A month later, he also started another blog &#8220;Technology Pandit&#8221; which had all the tech news. </p>\n\n<p>In Feb 2012, he renamed BNM and Technology Pandit to MyBollywood..! and Inside Tech respectively. He also started developing a few sites for companies of relatives like 360* Accounting. He also made an unofficial wedding site for his cousin&#8217;s marriage.</p>\n\n<p>He currently is a 11th grade student and after a month his 12th std. would start. His hobbies include Sports, Adventure, Eating, Photography, Internet and Literature.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.fb.me/rulekamdar","title":"Facebook"}]}
