Using basic business concepts and a positive outlook has been the key to his success. He has used experiences with business ideas that did not get off the ground to launch CurrySimple. Almost starting a web design company during the dot-com era gave Mikey the knowledge to launch his companyâ€™s website, CurrySimple.com, which was later featured in Entrepreneur Magazine. His love for technology would shine through years later.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to his life as a food entrepreneur, he had visions of being a professional football player, police officer and a real estate tycoon after reading Donald Trumpâ€™s book â€œThe Art of the Dealâ€. His uncle Timmy still tells stories of Michael reading the business section of The Washington Post at age 14 while asking his mom for a cup of hot chocolate.</p>\n\n<p>Sophomore year of High School changed his life forever when diagnosed with Melanoma skin cancer. Fortunately the cancer was found at an early stage and was quickly treated. Many of his friends did not even know about this experience until he was featured by Parade Magazine as a cancer survivor. This experience has left his outlook of life contagiously positive with a drive to succeed and help others.\nAt 21, Mikey felt trapped in his daily routine and moved from his hometown of Bethesda, Maryland to Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta was a fast growing city with many great opportunities. One of which came seven years later.</p>\n\n<p>His sister would taunt him to get a corporate job that would showcase his hard working skills. Mikey feared it would damper his creative thinking and dreams of coming up with a â€œbig ideaâ€. In 2005, while working at a Thai restaurant, Mikey developed his concept for a Thai food brand with the help of a manager that had manufacturing connections in Thailand. Michael launched his â€œbig ideaâ€, a product line of restaurant quality Thai sauces called CurrySimple, in January 2006.</p>\n\n<p>With only personal funding, Mikey has had to use guerrilla marketing techniques and word of mouth to expand the presence of his brand. After being featured on the front of The Washington Postâ€™s food section just three months after launching CurrySimple, he has been seen frequently in the media. TV appearances include FOX, CBS, ABC and CNBC along with multiple features in newspapers, magazines and radio.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, Mikey streamlined his food company to focus on his passion for technology. Pairing up with now business partner Quinton Pike, Mikey has used his previous experience to help launch a service to host and stream music in the cloud to be played on multiple devices anywhere in the world. Mougg has quickly launched with Rolling Stone saying it is &#8220;Fast, Simple and convenient.&#8221; As a serial entrepreneur Mikey continues to look for exciting opportunities around the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/9958/119958v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/9958/119958v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/9958/119958v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.CurrySimple.com","title":"Founder CEO"},{"external_url":"http://www.Mougg.com","title":"Partner COO"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.Modelfy.com","title":"COO"}]}
