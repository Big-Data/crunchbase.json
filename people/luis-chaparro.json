He loves to walk different paths and to discover some others.\nPassionate about design </p>\n\n<p>The brand was born in the middle of 2006, in Bogota-Colombia. Since the time I was studying to obtain my bachelorâ€™s degree on industrial design, I had always have an enormous interest in screen printing techniques and its possibilities.\nBy the time I got my bachelorâ€™s degree I decided to move on with the idea -driven by passion- I had in mind for a couple of years. Finally I was giving the step to design and produce some t-shirts, caps and put them out there in the market. That was one of the biggest decisions I made for my life because it makes me realize that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my days.\nI decided to mix some of my passions. Back in 2006 some friend of mine introduced me to Ultimate Frisbeeâ€¦ it was something like love at first sight; it was the perfect excuse for me to give life to the brand.\nBrand beginnings were like a hobby, everything started small and suddendly grow bigger, things begun to move faster we had people coming into our website asking for products and here we are 3 years after, still rocking the market loving what we do.\nWe feel proud for the things weâ€™ve done so far we know thereâ€™s a long and hard road to walk, but here we are facing everyday giants and giving every positive thing we have to satisfy our fans.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9785/139785v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[174,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/9785/139785v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[279,400],"assets/images/resized/0013/9785/139785v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://rebelsdefy.tumblr.com/","title":""}]}
