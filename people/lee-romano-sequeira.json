Aust)</p>\n\n<p>You know, every once in a while I run into someone who does some phenomenal things for the dogs in our world. Lee Romano Sequeira is just such a woman, and I wanted to give her kudos for her dedication.</p>\n\n<p>A life long animal owner, Lee has always been active in protecting the animals that surround her. You name it and she has owned it at one point in her life or another, many of which were rescues she lovingly brought into her home to give a nurturing forever home.</p>\n\n<p>A long time volunteer at her local shelter, she has worked hundreds of hours to help socialize, train, feed, groom and find loving homes for these much deserving animals. She has even adopted dogs herself that wouldn&#8217;t normally be adopted due to their age or special needs to include one of her current pack.  To a fourteen-year-old Yorkie to a Westie who believes she is the town mayor.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, she is the owner of GoodtoBeYou.com which has made it more difficult to donate time to her local shelter, however, she isn&#8217;t out of the game. She is a financial contributor to several animal organizations and has even offered specials where a percentage of her sales go directly to animal welfare organizations. Anyone who works online knows this is a pretty cool thing to do, particularly this time of year when sales can be a real downer. I don&#8217;t know about you, but to me, this takes a special person with a real dedication to the animals around us.</p>\n\n<p>Lee started GoodtoBeYou.com, as she puts it, â€œI&#8217;ve always had a love for feminine things. You could say I&#8217;m a girly girl.â€ Her product line is a combination of high quality brand name spa, bath and beauty products and accessories that are fun, chic, trendy and most importantly, affordable. They are geared towards â€œthe pampered princess in all of us,â€ but she also has a fantastic array of products for dogs and the â€œprinceâ€ in your life.</p>\n\n<p>I want everyone to know something else. This is in no way a paid ad. In today&#8217;s world, there are so many people who talk the talk but don&#8217;t walk the walk. Lee Romano Sequeira walks the walk. Her compassion, charity to dogs, both financial and in time, are something we should all aspire to emulate.</p>\n\n<p>Get over to her site, and do some Christmas shopping. She has it all, and you will know you will be helping the animals at the same time.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0003/4286/34286v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0003/4286/34286v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,256],"assets/images/resized/0003/4286/34286v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Lee Romano Sequeira / [GoodtoBeYou] (http://www.GoodtoBeYou.com)</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/goodtobeyou","title":"Twitter"}]}
