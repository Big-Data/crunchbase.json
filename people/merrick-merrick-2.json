His dynamic career has come full circle over two decades — from working in the trenches as a hybrid engineer, designer, and marketer at seminal startups to founding a global advertising agency and back to his startup roots as an advisor and investor. His impact in both software and advertising can be felt around the world.</p>\n\n<p>A notable but reclusive wunderkind in the early 90s, Merrick&#8217;s career includes early team or contract roles at NCSA (Mosaic), Macromedia Flash (now Adobe Flash), Urchin Software (now Google Analytics), Whitman-Hart/marchFIRST, and a few of the world&#8217;s largest advertising agencies. </p>\n\n<p>In 2000, Merrick founded a design, communications and technology service agency that would become Tangible Worldwide (previously known as Lakonic). Tangible&#8217;s clients include: Walmart, T-Mobile, Gemini Spirits (Sazerac), Chillingo (EA Mobile), MTV, and AIGA. The agency was once recognized as one of the fastest growing interactive agencies in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Merrick lives in Portland, OR with Auggie — the best dog in the world — where he serves as chairman of Tangible Worldwide, as well as co-founder, investor and advisor for multiple startups. He is an active advocate for the local startup scene and plans to join the elusive ranks of &#8220;Portland-based venture capitalists&#8221; in 2012.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/7468/167468v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/7468/167468v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/7468/167468v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","firm":{"name":"Tangible Worldwide","permalink":"tangible-worldwide","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Cloudability","permalink":"cloudability","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"MoPix","permalink":"mopix-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0016/9449/169449v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0016/9449/169449v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0016/9449/169449v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"merrickhanna ventures","permalink":"merrickhanna-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Vendscreen","permalink":"vendscreen","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0017/0953/170953v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0017/0953/170953v2-max-250x250.png"],[[267,156],"assets/images/resized/0017/0953/170953v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","firm":{"name":"PIE","permalink":"pie","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,128],"assets/images/resized/0014/3612/143612v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,213],"assets/images/resized/0014/3612/143612v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[366,313],"assets/images/resized/0014/3612/143612v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/cloudability-raises-1-1m-to-help-businesses-manage-and-monitor-cloud-costs/","source_description":"Cloudability Raises $1.1M To Help Businesses Manage And Monitor Cloud Costs","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Cloudability","permalink":"cloudability","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/mayorrock","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://angel.co/mayorrock","title":"AngelList"},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/merrick","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
