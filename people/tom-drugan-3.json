Twelve year online marketing veteran, previously at Orbitz.com and numerous Chicago based interactive agencies. </p>\n\n<p>Tom developed the initial concept behind Naymz back in 2004 while using his search engine marketing expertise to help friends earn top position in Google for their first and last names. As personal publishing tools like Blogger and social networking communities like Friendster and MySpace began to flourish in the mid-2000&#8217;s, Mr. Drugan saw a growing need for individuals to monitor what was being said about them online and promote themselves positively on search engines and social networks. </p>\n\n<p>Tom, along with four other colleagues from Orbitz, left their cozy corporate jobs and started working on the idea in the Fall of 2005. They launched Naymz.com in June of 2006 and it quickly became one of the leading, pioneering platforms focused on online reputation management and personal promotion for individuals. Mr. Drugan wrote an eBook and did numerous workshops for students and professionals teaching the pitfalls and opportunities associated with this new day and age of online transparency. Tom became a renown Online Reputation Management expert and has conducted interviews with the Wall Street Journal, Inc. Magazine, ABC, MSNBC, NPR, USA Today, Chicago Tribune, and other globally recognized publications. </p>\n\n<p>In October of 2007, Naymz expanded it&#8217;s offering and became a full-fledged social network that helped colleagues connect and endorse one another on the Web. Currently Naymz has over 1.5 million active members. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to starting Naymz, Mr. Drugan was an eMarketing Manager at Orbitz.com and focused on large scale search engine partnerships and integrations. </p>\n\n<p>From 1999 to 2005, Tom learned his trade as a Project Manager, Account Manager, and Sr. Online Marketing Manager at various online marketing agencies. Mr. Drugan has worked with and advised companies such as CheapTickets, Lodging.com, Accenture, Microsoft, Motorola, Kraft Foods, and Oscar Mayer.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[137,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/4676/184676v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/4676/184676v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[413,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/4676/184676v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Advertising","institution":"University of Illinois","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Naymz","permalink":"naymz","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/0031/30031v11-max-150x150.png"],[[200,70],"assets/images/resized/0003/0031/30031v11-max-250x250.png"],[[200,70],"assets/images/resized/0003/0031/30031v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"eMarketing Manager","firm":{"name":"Orbitz Worldwide","permalink":"orbitz","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/6753/16753v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/6753/16753v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/6753/16753v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.searchenginejournal.com/naymz-interview-tom-drugan-on-identity-management-and-his-roots-in-orbitz-sem/3608/","title":"Search Engine Journal"},{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120320660446474003.html","title":"WSJ Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6462504","title":"NPR Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2006/oct/23/put-your-best-side-at-top-of-google/","title":"Chicago Tribune Interview"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.naymz.com/thomasdrugan","title":"Naymz"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/tdrugan","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
