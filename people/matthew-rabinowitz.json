He also received the Terman Award, the highest academic honor offered by the School of Engineering at Stanford. In 1997, he completed an MSc in Electrical Engineering, and received a graduate fellowship to the School of Electrical Engineering at Stanford. In 2000, Matthew completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford. His Ph.D. involved the development of a navigation system that combined Low Earth Orbit Satellites with the Global Positioning System to achieve centimeter-level positioning. During his Ph.D., Matthew consulted with IntegriNautics Corporation, to investigate the commercial applications of the technology resulting from his PhD. In 1999, he took a leave of absence from Stanford, to work full time at Panopticon, a company he had co-founded to address the challenge of online, automated, intelligent merchandizing. In 2000 the company was sold, as Panop.com, for roughly $100 million. In September of 2000, Matthew co-founded Rosum Corporation. While Matthew was CEO of the company, it was recognized as one of the top ten â€œMost Promising Wireless Startups in the USâ€ as determined by the Wireless Ventures Committee, and while Matthew was CTO the company was recognized as one of the Red Herring Top 100 Technology Startup Companies in North America. Matthew has authored several papers and patents in the fields of optimization, signal processing, navigation, bioinformatics and machine learning. In 2005, he was selected by MIT Technology Review Magazine as one of the top 35 technology innovators under 35 in the United States. Matthew joined the faculty of Stanford in 2003, and is currently a Consulting Associate Professor in the School of Engineering.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http://rosum.com/rosum_experienced_leadership.html\" title=\"Rosum\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosum</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Rabinowitz has pursued dual careers in industry and academia. Prior to Gene Security Network, he co-founded two technology companies: The first (panop.com) developed a system for real-time intelligent merchandizing on the web and was sold for approximately $100M; the second (rosum.com) developed an indoor location technology using broadcast digital television signals to augment GPS. That company was recognized as one of 30 Top Technology Pioneers for 2005 by the World Economic Forum. Dr. Rabinowitz has authored several papers and patents in optimization, signal processing, machine learning and bioinformatics. He has received the Scott Helt Memorial Award from IEEE and was selected by MIT Technology Review Magazine as one of the top 35 technology innovators under 35 in the US. Matthew joined the Stanford faculty in 2003, and is now a Consulting Associate Professor in Engineering.
