Music as Interactive Director of Partner Relations. Prior to that she was Senior Interactive Producer at KCRW, a world-renowned radio station broadcasting at kcrw.com and from 89.9 fm in Los Angeles, CA. While at KCRW, Nicole handled content management and page buildouts at kcrw.com. She oversaw social media initiatives leading to over 30,000 friends, followers, and fans of the station.</p>\n\n<p>As an Associate Producer at Ten Music, a commercial music house representing top indie record labels and composers, Nicole worked with major advertising agencies to produce original music for nationally-aired television commercials for brands like Grey Goose, Oil of Olay, DirecTV, Mercedes, John Frieda and the NHL. She has worked with members of the original Black Eyed Peas, RedCola, and The Rondo Brothers. She signed MC Lyte, a female hip-hop artist, for a major television campaign for Old Navy and discovered an unsigned indie rock band named Marqui Adora whose music was featured in a national spot for Nissan.</p>\n\n<p>Nicoleâ€™s forte as a producer is fusing music and new media to generate content and cross-marketing opportunity. Sheâ€™s worked on several large Internet initiatives including a proprietary database of indie music for licensing, a social community for assisted-living individuals in the greater-Boston area, and has handled A&amp;R brand work for online campaigns for Target and Toyota.</p>\n\n<p>With a B.A. in Information Communication Processes from Ohio State University and an M.A. in New Media from Emerson College, Nicoleâ€™s background runs the gamut from producing to populating original content. Graduating in the top three of her class, Nicoleâ€™s Masterâ€™s Thesis focusing on dominant ideology in the media was selected to be published by the college. One of her interactive projects entitled â€œBrand Identityâ€ explored the oblique nature of commerce and culture and was featured in an interactive art show.</p>\n\n<p>As a music lover, Nicole set out to put her imprint on the â€œRevolutionsâ€ radio program broadcast on WERS Boston by bringing in over a 75% increase in semi-annual listener contributions and over 5,000 listeners nightly. The station, as acknowledged by the Princeton Review, is the top college radio station in the country. Beginning with a 4am-6am on-air stint at WBGU then shortly thereafter taking a position as Production Coordinator for ohio.fm â€“ one of the first college radio stations to stream online â€“ Nicole finally landed at KCRW in Santa Monica, CA where she worked with DJ, Music Supervisor and cultural tastemaker Garth Trinidad on his evening music program for two years.</p>\n\n<p>At Yahoo! Music Nicole works closely with record labels and within the music programming team to schedule and populate audio and video content.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole is a regular contributor to The Daily Swarm, a directory of music news sources and headlines; Flavorpill, a daily guide to quality cultural events in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, and London; and Made This For You, a place to discuss, collaborate and implement various design solutions for social change.</p>\n\n<p>She regularly DJâ€™s at events in and around the LA area and volunteers with the Step Up Womenâ€™s Network, A national network of women dedicated to strengthening community resources for women and girls.</p>\n\n<p>contact: me at nicolecifani dot com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/3349/83349v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/3349/83349v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/3349/83349v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"M.A.","subject":"New Media, Media Arts","institution":"Emerson College","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Interactive Communications Processes","institution":"Ohio State University","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://nicolecifani.com","title":""}]}
