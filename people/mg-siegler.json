He&#8217;s previously lived in Los Angeles where he worked in Hollywood and in San Diego where he was a web developer. He also writes at his own blogs, <a href=\"http://parislemon.com\" title=\"ParisLemon\" rel=\"nofollow\">ParisLemon</a> and <a href=\"http://massivegreatness.com\" title=\"Massive Greatness\" rel=\"nofollow\">Massive Greatness</a>, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/parislemon\" title=\"tweets\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweets</a> a lot. </p>\n\n<p>He now lives in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conflicts Of Interest</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a partner at <a href=\"http://crunchfund.com\" title=\"CrunchFund\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrunchFund</a>, a venture capital firm with investments in many startups around the world. I am also a limited partner in a couple other venture funds. And I&#8217;m an advisor to a few companies. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, the only public stock I own is Facebook, which I bought because I believe it was a damn good deal long-term. No, I don&#8217;t hold any shares of Apple stock, though I probably should. </p>\n\n<p>I have compiled a list of investments <a href=\"http://parislemon.com/investments\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> â€” though there are quite a few that aren&#8217;t yet public, so it&#8217;s not quite complete. </p>\n\n<p>As an investor with a lot of positions, I&#8217;ll be transparent about them when appropriate. It&#8217;s that simple. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/0962/40962v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/0962/40962v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[266,266],"assets/images/resized/0004/0962/40962v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"","institution":"University of Michigan","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"CrunchFund","permalink":"crunchfund","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0019/2000/192000v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0019/2000/192000v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0019/2000/192000v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Branch","permalink":"branch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7498/197498v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/7498/197498v2-max-250x250.png"],[[415,415],"assets/images/resized/0019/7498/197498v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Columnist","firm":{"name":"TechCrunch","permalink":"techcrunch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Writer","firm":{"name":"TechCrunch","permalink":"techcrunch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Writer","firm":{"name":"VentureBeat","permalink":"venturebeat","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0001/1625/11625v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/1625/11625v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/1625/11625v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://about.me/parislemon","title":"About.me"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/parislemon","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/parislemon","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/107753428759636856492","title":"Google+"}]}
