Thatâ€™s the way I focus my abilities. At the University I was able to hone those skills. Additionally a further driving force for success was my increased knowledge of marketing, investing, and organizational development. Ever since I knew I wanted to be part of a tech start-up.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I am skilled at CSS, PHP, jQuery, Dreamweaver, WordPress, Drupal, Maya, Cinema 4D, SEO, SEM, Photoshop, Illustrator, Vegas Video and After Effects.</p>\n\n<p>Initially,I started developing programing and design skills by doing small freelance projects. In 2006 I co-founded a web development company called White Label Graphics. That company was a great learning experience and continues to be successful today. Currently TicketCake.com is our flagship project. Itâ€™s cloud hosted software to help small and midsized venues with promotions, record keeping &amp; order processing.</p>\n\n<p>I have so many ideas and aspirations sometimes I struggle to keep them realistic but there is no questions about it, I love what I do and I love what Iâ€™m building.</p>\n\n<p>Dylan@DylanJorgensen.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,122],"assets/images/resized/0011/1110/111110v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,204],"assets/images/resized/0011/1110/111110v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[342,280],"assets/images/resized/0011/1110/111110v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Co-Founder of TicketCake.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Ticket Cake","permalink":"ticket-cake","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/1836/81836v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0008/1836/81836v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/1836/81836v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"White Label Graphics","permalink":"white-label-graphics","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://ticketcake.com","title":"Ticket Cake | Co-Founder"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://dylanjorgensen.com","title":"Personal Blog"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/dylanjorgensen","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/#!/dylan.jorgensen","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjorgensen","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://digg.com/dylanjorgensen","title":"Digg"}]}
