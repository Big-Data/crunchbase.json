He was also one of the first organizers of the Turkey City Writer&#8217;s Workshop, and is a frequent attendee at the Sycamore Hill Writer&#8217;s Workshop. He won Hugo Awards for his novelettes Bicycle Repairman  and Taklamakan.</p>\n\n<p>His first novel, Involution Ocean, published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the atmosphere is contained in a single, miles-deep crater; the story concerns a ship sailing on the ocean of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional pastiche of Moby-Dick by Herman Melville.</p>\n\n<p>From the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe: the solar system is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do genetic engineering on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with alien civilizations; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the galaxy, reminiscent of The Singularity in the works of Vernor Vinge. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection Crystal Express and the collection Schismatrix Plus, which contains the original novel Schismatrix and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. Alastair Reynolds identified Schismatrix and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.\nBruce Sterling at the 2010 Augmented Reality Event</p>\n\n<p>In the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical fanzine Cheap Truth, under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called Catscan, for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine, SF Eye.</p>\n\n<p>He recently contributed a chapter to Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky.</p>\n\n<p>From April 2009 through May 2009, he was an editor at Cool Tools.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2003 Sterling has blogged at &#8220;Beyond the Beyond&#8221;, which is hosted by Wired.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/6718/126718v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/6718/126718v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,330],"assets/images/resized/0012/6718/126718v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
