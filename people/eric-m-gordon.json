He was head of medicinal chemistry at Squibb and Bristol Myers Squibb in Princeton, where he worked for 18 years. In 1992, he became Vice President of Research and Director of Chemistry at Affymax in Palo Alto, and had that role until the company was sold to Glaxo in 1995. In 1996, he became scientific co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Versicor (later Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2005). In 1998 he participated in the early stages of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: SNSS) and was Senior Vice President of Research until late 2002. He is an accepted authority on combinatorial chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and creating drugs through enzyme inhibition. Eric has authored more than 200 scientific manuscripts and U.S. patents, and portions of 3 books, including editing a comprehensive book on combinatorial chemistry. He is the senior author of two manuscripts which during 1994-1996 were the most frequently cited chemistry papers in the world. He is on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the Organization for One World Health, as well as several biotechnology companies. He serves on the Editorial Advisory Board of five scientific journals. In 1997 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in medicinal chemistry from the University of Wisconsin in Madison and conducted post-doctoral work at Yale University. He joined Skyline in 2002. Like John, he is a lifelong Yankee fan, but is old enough to have attended Woodstock, the Beatles concert at Shea Stadium in 1965, and the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/0368/30368v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0003/0368/30368v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0003/0368/30368v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Skyline Ventures","permalink":"skyline-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0003/0323/30323v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0003/0323/30323v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0003/0323/30323v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
