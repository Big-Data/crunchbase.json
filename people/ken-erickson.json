During the late 1990s, he built the sales and marketing organizations at Value America, the first national scale Internet retailer. This experience positioned him to lead the emergence of a new market for healthcare services.</p>\n\n<p>As founder of the first International PPO, Global Choice Healthcare, and of the first domestic medical-travel network, Healthplace America, Erickson was among the first to apply basic business, economic, and marketing principles to healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>By doing so, he established the first medical network built on global case rates, allowing health plans to understand the actual costs of major medical procedures. More importantly, Mr. Erickson recognized the triangular relationship of the plan as customer, the plan member as consumer, and the provider as vendor to deliver a market-based solution that benefits all three participants.</p>\n\n<p>He is also a frequent speaker on the subject of the importance of transparency and competition in healthcare.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,135],"assets/images/resized/0014/3368/143368v1-max-150x150.png"],[[102,135],"assets/images/resized/0014/3368/143368v1-max-250x250.png"],[[102,135],"assets/images/resized/0014/3368/143368v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Theology","institution":"Seattle University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"History","institution":"Seattle University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"National Surgery Network","permalink":"national-surgery-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0014/3366/143366v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0014/3366/143366v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[408,92],"assets/images/resized/0014/3366/143366v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
