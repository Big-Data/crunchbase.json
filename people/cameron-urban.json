He has lived in Germany, Russia and Bolivia, which has given him the opportunity to explore diverse business philosophies. His travels helped to shape his own philosophy, which is that business takes much more than an unrelenting push to increase sales and profit margins. Rather, business has a responsibility to benefit people: what you give to others is reciprocated in what comes back to you. With this philosophy, Cameron has found his niche in creative marketing. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,145],"assets/images/resized/0018/8746/188746v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,145],"assets/images/resized/0018/8746/188746v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,145],"assets/images/resized/0018/8746/188746v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JellyfishArt.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"AnyVivo","permalink":"anyvivo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0018/8743/188743v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/8743/188743v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/8743/188743v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director and Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Jellyfish Art","permalink":"jellyfish-art","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0007/9013/79013v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0007/9013/79013v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0007/9013/79013v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
