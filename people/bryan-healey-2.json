Grace and Goldman Sachs). </p>\n\n<p>Shortly afterward, I became the head of technology at Garment Valet, a young Boston-based startup in need of automation and innovation. In three years, I successfully converted the company to a fully digital organization, streamlining operations and improving performance, including handling the administration of the department (personnel and budget).</p>\n\n<p>From there, I transitioned into a full-time senior engineering position at Shape Up The Nation, a nationally recognized corporate social-network based in Providence, RI. Working on a LAMP architecture that is heavily trafficked in a fast-paced Agile environment, I developed many customer-facing applications with a strong focus on high availability and algorithmic relevancy, while leading projects and managing infrastructure advances.</p>\n\n<p>I am now working at NameMedia as a senior software engineer and team leader. I am the principle engineer on the product NameFind and the redesign of Afternic. As well, I am actively developing a socially engineered citizen journalism service named Littera Report, built on a scalable LAMP architecture with strong localization emphasis. I am also the original developer and primary supporter of a PHP-based MVC framework named Helium.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,135],"assets/images/resized/0011/8048/118048v4-max-150x150.png"],[[206,186],"assets/images/resized/0011/8048/118048v4-max-250x250.png"],[[206,186],"assets/images/resized/0011/8048/118048v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Littera Media","permalink":"littera-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2401/202401v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2401/202401v4-max-250x250.png"],[[272,272],"assets/images/resized/0020/2401/202401v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Littera Report","permalink":"digest-report-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/7966/117966v8-max-150x150.png"],[[232,232],"assets/images/resized/0011/7966/117966v8-max-250x250.png"],[[232,232],"assets/images/resized/0011/7966/117966v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Littera Papers","permalink":"littera-papers","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0022/3067/223067v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0022/3067/223067v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0022/3067/223067v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Littera Press","permalink":"littera-press","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/2400/202400v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/2400/202400v4-max-250x250.png"],[[255,255],"assets/images/resized/0020/2400/202400v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Started web start-up in education management","stoned_year":2005,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanhealey","source_text":null,"source_description":"LinkedIn","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Bryan","last_name":"Healey","permalink":"bryan-healey-2"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanhealey","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/wanderingvoid","title":"Twitter"}]}
