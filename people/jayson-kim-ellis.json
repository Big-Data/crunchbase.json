I meet with clients to ascertain their marketing goals. Then, I collect customer demographic information (e.g., gender, income, age) and market data (e.g., competition prices, distribution channels, industry sales) through primary research methods (such as questionnaires, surveys and focus groups) and secondary research (information from industry associations, statisticians and marketing experts).
