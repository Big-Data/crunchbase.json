I received my Ph.D. from the University of Virginia creating wireless technologies to assess the health of those living with movement disorders such as Parkinson&#8217;s and essential tremor. My work resulted in new clinical instrumentation, 16 publications, and coverage in Computer magazine, Healthcare IT News, and Medgadget. I currently lead technology and product development at the wireless health startup, BeClose, which I co-founded in 2009. Our technology promotes safety and wellness for older or disabed individuals seeking to live independently, and we have been featured in TechCrunch, The New York Times, NPR, USA Today, ABC News, and Money Magazine. I enjoy meeting people with similar interests and projects, so feel free to contact me if you wish to share ideas.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/4521/184521v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[227,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/4521/184521v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,275],"assets/images/resized/0018/4521/184521v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Ph.D.","subject":"Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering Concentration","institution":"University of Virginia","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering","institution":"University of Virginia","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, Head of Technology and Product","firm":{"name":"BeClose","permalink":"beclose","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0010/9181/109181v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/9181/109181v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,71],"assets/images/resized/0010/9181/109181v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.MarkAHanson.com/","title":""}]}
