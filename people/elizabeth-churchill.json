Research in Santa Clara, CA. She works in the area of media experience, her area of interest being social media.</p>\n\n<p>At the highest level, she is interested in thinking about the emerging digital media &#8220;ethnoscapes &#8211; the fluid, shifting landscape of people and groups - passersby, tourists, immigrants, exiles&#8221; that make internet life.</p>\n\n<p>Following previous work in Japan, the US and the UK, she increasingly takes a centri-cultural approach - that is, being curious about the ways in which social technologies and social media are created, consumed, adopted and adapted in different (although sometimes overlapping) local and national cultures.</p>\n\n<p>More concretely, her work continues threads that have been previously developed: mediated collaboration, mobile connectivity, transmedia technologies, digital archive and memory, and the development of emplaced media spaces. Most of these are elaborated in more detail in her written publications.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/7555/27555v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/7555/27555v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/7555/27555v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://elizabethchurchill.com/</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"1st","subject":"experimental psychology","institution":"university of sussex","graduated_year":1983,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal Research Scientist","firm":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://research.yahoo.com/bouncer_user/29","title":"Yahoo Research Bio"}],"web_presences":[]}
