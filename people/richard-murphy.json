I work primarily in the NY Metropolitan area, but I also have a nationwide network of Recruiters that I can reach out to for positions in other areas of the country. Most all of my candidates come from direct and indirect recruiting and I have built a solid base of IT contacts for research and referral; this allows me to rapidly respond to your needs with qualified, pre-screened candidates.</p>\n\n<p>My company, BryceNet, Inc. is dedicated to professionalism, loyalty to my clients and getting results. My previous employer was Management Recruiters Intâ€™l, Inc. (MRI). I was with MRI from 1984 through 2010. I had been the number one Account Executive in the nation at MRI numerous times, and I was consistently among the top 5 Account Executives nationwide. I have also been named the #2 Account Manager for the entire Decade of the &#8216;90&#8217;s. I had consistently led my previous office to its position as the #1 Office in the nation. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to that, I had served 9 years in the U.S. Marine Corps.
