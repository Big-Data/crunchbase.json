His doctoral dissertation explored visual pattern extraction and online learning in dynamic environments. After completing his PhD, he worked with a team at Boston University developing nanoscale neurons for mechatronic perception and memory. He collaborated with Hewlett-Packard to design nanoscale processors that mimic noisy, massively parallel brain computations, and now offers his data mining expertise to companies looking to understand customer preferences. He splits his time between Boston and Hyderabad, India.</p>\n\n<p>He is a co-author of the book, A Billion Wicked Thoughts.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/9776/149776v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,222],"assets/images/resized/0014/9776/149776v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,222],"assets/images/resized/0014/9776/149776v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.
