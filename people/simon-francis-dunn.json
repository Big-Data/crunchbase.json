Dunn started his first company at the age of 20 and went on to raise Â£2.46 million from its sale.</p>\n\n<p>He attended <strong>Park View Community School</strong>, Chester-Le-Street, Co Durham; he grew up in a nearby small village. His parents separated when he was young. He has a younger sister, Melanie Dunn. He was diagnosed with Dyslexia in his teens and written off by his teachers at school. Dunn however describes Dyslexia as having its <em>&#8221;own brilliance&#8221;</em> and was once quoted saying <em>&#8221;It has been a gift and my ultimate driving force in making me the man I see in the mirror today&#8221;</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>He started out in business at a very young age in the school play-ground. Dunn would purchase chocolate bars from the school canteen and also wholesalers whilst he did a morning paper-round before school, then he would divide them up into smaller pieces and sell each piece of chocolate to his playground friends that couldn&#8217;t afford to buy sweets themselves. This is how Dunn said he would <em>&#8221;earn interest&#8221;</em> on his pocket money for that week. </p>\n\n<p>Having learnt this fundamental aspect of making a profit from sales at such a young age Dunn went onto become the Managing Director of Kudos (a prestigious car rental company) at the age of 20. When only 3 years later the business was sold for an unofficial Â£2.46m. </p>\n\n<p>After this Dunn immediately started on his next project, An aid to help those looking for romance. Using the Internet as Dunn&#8217;s domain, he set-up Single Hot And Loaded Ltd in Sept 2008 and in January 2010 the company opened it&#8217;s doors and started trading. Since it&#8217;s launch the business has reported between a 200% - 700% increase in sales month on month for the first 6 months of trading and continue to go from strength to strength.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0177/50177v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[121,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/0177/50177v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[219,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/0177/50177v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"CFP ","subject":"Finance","institution":"Financial Services Skills Council","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"CeMap","subject":"Finance & Property","institution":"Institute of Financial Services","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"NineTen Ltd","permalink":"nineten-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Single Hot And Loadedâ„¢","permalink":"single-hot-loaded","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/9979/49979v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/9979/49979v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[370,370],"assets/images/resized/0004/9979/49979v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"The Dating Platform","permalink":"the-dating-platform","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/4714/104714v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0010/4714/104714v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[450,118],"assets/images/resized/0010/4714/104714v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Kudos Hire","permalink":"kudos-hire","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.pr.com/press-release/161327","title":"PR.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.pr.com/press-release/161987","title":"PR.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.pressbox.co.uk/detailed/Internet/Internet_Dating_Booms_Through_Credit_Crunch_331952.html","title":"PressBox"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.ecademy.com/account.php?id=306799","title":"Ecademy"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=1328374627&ref=profile","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/simon-francis-dunn/10/aa4/410","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://wikibin.org/articles/simon-dunn-2.html","title":"Wiki"},{"external_url":"http://www.affluence.org/profile.php?user=simonfdunn","title":"Affluence.org"}]}
