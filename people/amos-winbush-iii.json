Through his leadership and careful study of what happened to promising companies of the past, Amos grew the company from a small business operating out of his studio apartment to a disruptive technology valued at $20 mill.</p>\n\n<p>Amosâ€™ vision of a universal data synchronization service came about when Amosâ€™ smart phone crashed resulting in thousands of essential files being lost. When he realized that no solution existed, Amos set out to design and build a universal wireless solution that allows users to back up, manage and retrieve their mobile content.</p>\n\n<p>Seizing the rare opportunity to partner with a major technology company, Amos orchestrated CyberSynchsâ€™ partnership with Sun Microsystems, enabling the company to develop on the JAVAFX platform and access the Sun Cloud. Sun Microsystems distributes CyberSynchs within JavaFX. The Sun Agreement exponentially expanded CyberSynchsâ€™ market penetration.</p>\n\n<p>Today Amos leads his small executive team as they increase the CyberSynchs market share through additional agreements with mobile phone, smart phone and digital camera manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p>A noteworthy â€œunder 30 CEO,â€ Amos has presented at the JAVAONE conference and a variety of technology and entrepreneurial conferences in New Yorkâ€™s Silicon Alley. He recently was recognized as Black Enterpriseâ€™s Innovator of the Year for 2010, as well as in Entrepreneur Magazineâ€™s â€œ100 Brilliant Companiesâ€ for 2010.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"CyberSynchs","permalink":"cybersynchs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/0699/30699v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,130],"assets/images/resized/0003/0699/30699v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[363,189],"assets/images/resized/0003/0699/30699v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
