He has an extensive background working professionally (11+ years) with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and client-side performance techniques as it pertains to web development. If he is not wielding client-side code he is likely toying with interface/interaction design, PHP, MVC frameworks, iPhone development, jQuery, Dojo, or authoring material and speaking at various conferences. When not sitting in front of a computer, it&#8217;s a sure bet he is hanging out with his wife &amp; kids in Boise, Idaho, training for triathlons, skiing, mountain biking, road biking, alpine climbing, reading, watching movies, or debating the rational evidence for a Christian worldview.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3293/103293v2-max-150x150.png"],[[221,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3293/103293v2-max-250x250.png"],[[399,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3293/103293v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Communications - Advertising emphasis","institution":"University of Idaho","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Client-side Engineer","firm":{"name":"Memolane","permalink":"memolane","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1451/101451v4-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0010/1451/101451v4-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0010/1451/101451v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Client-side Engineer","firm":{"name":"Ning","permalink":"ning","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/4498/4498v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4498/4498v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4498/4498v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/codylindley","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/codylindley","title":""}]}
