Since the early days of the Internet, Henning has played an important role in the deployment of new technologies.  At eWorld Media his group launched one of the earliest versions of a flash email delivery system.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Morales currently heads up eWorld Companies, Inc., a company dedicated to creating and delivering the absolute best Internet technologies and services directly to the entertainment industry.  And once again, Henning is involved in ground breaking work.  The media distribution engine and advertising network that Henning Morales and his current team have developed is absolutely state of the art.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges that Henning Morales and eWorld Companies have put to task is to infuse the Internet with the excitement of entertainment and the glamour of Hollywood.  This has been eWorldâ€™s central goal, and over the past few months these efforts have taken root and eWorld has attracted the interests of key members of the Hollywood elite, several of whom are now engaged with eWorld on major content deals. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2812/82812v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[122,189],"assets/images/resized/0008/2812/82812v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[122,189],"assets/images/resized/0008/2812/82812v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, President & CEO ","firm":{"name":"eWorld Companies","permalink":"eworld-companies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0008/2768/82768v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0008/2768/82768v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[297,109],"assets/images/resized/0008/2768/82768v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Top gold distributor for Quorum in Mexico; built a sales organization of six thousand people","stoned_year":1995,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://henningmorales.com/","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Henning","last_name":"Morales","permalink":"henning-morales"}},{"description":"Named director of the Latin American Expansion Team for FutureNet, a public company.","stoned_year":1996,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Henning","last_name":"Morales","permalink":"henning-morales"}},{"description":"Headed team of 20 people who each earned $10,000+ per month in FutureNet pre-launch in Mexico.
