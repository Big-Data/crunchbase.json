As he says, â€œThe patterns are so very similar across industries â€“we can automate this whole process and help so many small businesses do this.â€</p>\n\n<p>Adam is a â€œdata guyâ€ at heart, at home with quantitative modeling and data management. He has cut his teeth with data optimization, normalization, and categorization algorithms and has written predictive algorithms for a variety of applications.
