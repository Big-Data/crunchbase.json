The idea was that sharing files should be easy, for everybody, and not require knowledge of how to install a program, or understand the difference between 1 kilobyte and 1 gigabyte. This idea was implemented, some competitions was won, and it got some traction. Him and his friend stopped studying and started working full-time on this project.</p>\n\n<p>He started programming in high school. Nothing fancy, but just whatever popped to his mind. Liked doing programs that other people could use.</p>\n\n<p>Before university he studied at a film school and worked shortly in the film industry before going back to computers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0010/7311/107311v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0010/7311/107311v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0010/7311/107311v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Ge.tt","permalink":"ge-tt","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/7326/107326v2-max-150x150.png"],[[140,182],"assets/images/resized/0010/7326/107326v2-max-250x250.png"],[[140,182],"assets/images/resized/0010/7326/107326v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturecup.dk/kkloud","title":""}],"web_presences":[]}
