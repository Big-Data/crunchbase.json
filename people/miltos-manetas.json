Manetas&#8217; work consists of depictions of computer-related items such as oil paintings of computer hardware and videos that utilize clips from videogames. Media Theorist Lev Manovich wrote that &#8220;these works can be seen within a well-established tradition in modern painting of representing modern people in their particularly modern settings. For this reason, Manetas can be truly called a painter of contemporary life.&#8221; Another side of Manetas&#8217;s work are his art-websites and his work with &#8216;Neen&#8217;, the first digital fine art movement of the 21st century which was introduced at Gagosian Gallery, NYC in 2000. &#8216;Neen&#8217; pieces are usually web-based artworks (one-piece-in-a-domain), sentimental works made with computer or in reference to computers, or artwork created by artificial intelligence or a network. So far, 120 &#8216;Neen&#8217; works exist at Neen.org.</p>\n\n<p>DLD Arts Projects 09 Contribution: Live VJ Set, DLD Night, Haus der Kunst, Munich.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5264/35264v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5264/35264v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,320],"assets/images/resized/0003/5264/35264v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.dld-conference.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
