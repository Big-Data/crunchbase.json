Sun was funded by longtime friend and board member <a href=\"/person/john-doerr\" title=\"John Doerr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Doerr</a> of <a href=\"/financial-organization/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers\" title=\"Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1986 Vinod joined Kleiner Perkins, where he was and continues to be a general partner of KPCB funds through KP X. Through the years there, with other partners, he took on <a href=\"/company/intel\" title=\"Intel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel</a>&#8217;s monopoly with Nexgen/<a href=\"/company/amd\" title=\"AMD\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMD</a> (the only microprocessor to have significant success against Intel, sold to AMD for 28 percent of AMD), incubated the idea and business plan for <a href=\"/company/juniper-networks\" title=\"Juniper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juniper</a> to take on <a href=\"/company/cisco\" title=\"Cisco\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cisco</a>&#8217;s dominance of the router market, formulated the very early advertising-based search strategy for Excite, and transformed the moribund telecommunications business and its archaic SONET implementations with <a href=\"/company/cerent-corporation\" title=\"Cerent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cerent</a> (sold to Cisco for $7.4B).</p>\n\n<p>In 2004, Vinod ventured out to create his own venture firm, <a href=\"/financial-organization/khosla-ventures\" title=\"Khosla Ventures\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khosla Ventures</a>, which invests in a broad portfolio of cleantech, healthtech and infotech startups.</p>\n\n<p>Vinod holds a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, a Master&#8217;s in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon
