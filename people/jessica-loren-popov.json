Jess spearheads Chicago digital marketing company Kambio Group and the technology/pop culture blog SocialTechPop. Jess’s new book on the burgeoning Pinterest platform proves that she has an intimate understanding of the social media scene with an eye toward the future. Jess’ natural marketing capabilities are malleable to any business, and she never stops contributing new ideas. She has contributed across the industry and across the spectrum, working with everyone from Fortune 500 companies to a company that hosts the “largest bar crawl in America.”</p>\n\n<p>Jess awakened her entrepreneurial spirit at an early age. After running her own lemonade stand when she was only 5, her street-side business grew and grew. Lemonade stands were just the beginning: Jess’s neighborhood held a 200-family garage sale every year, and a young Jess knew an opportunity when she saw one. Jess began selling hot dogs and quickly became a local hit, raising around $800-1000 per day.</p>\n\n<p>Although Jess jokes about how those early years were her “most successful years as an entrepreneur,” she has certainly tasted success outside of the sidewalk. Jess sold her first start-up, the coupon website ChiTown Deals, within six months of its creation. ChiTown Deals separated itself from similar companies by filming videos of the place or service offered to give people a preview of what they were in for. ChiTown Deals’ success was a result of bringing a different approach to an existing idea and resonating in social media.</p>\n\n<p>Jess studied at Indiana University in Bloomington and Loyola University in Chicago, focusing on advertising and public relations. Chicago is fully engrossed in a technology boom, and Jess loves being a part of it. “No matter where I go, I’ll still be regarded as a Chicago entrepreneur,” Jess says, “And I want to be regarded as a Chicago entrepreneur.”</p>\n\n<p>With Kambio Group and SocialTechPop, Jess firmly establishes her role as a prominent Chicago entrepreneur, just as Pinterest for Business cements Jess as a leading expert in the social media community. Pinterest for Business, a guide to utilizing the next big social media giant in your company’s online profile tactics, will be the first of its kind to analyze Pinterest from a business resources perspective. The book will be available at all major retailers in Summer 2012. Pinterest for Business is proving to be the definitive text on the upcoming platform, and Jess is excited to be a part of it.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, Kambio Group enables Jess to lend her skills in social media and beyond to other companies with game-changing ideas. At leading tech blog SocialTechPop, Jess brings tech news to the common person, with an underlying theme of technology relating to society, pop culture and entertainment. Jess says she has an “entrepreneurial bug” that compels her to pursue new concepts and build a “company of culture.” In fact, Jess has each of her staff compose a piece of artwork for the office to encourage further creativity in the workplace.</p>\n\n<p>That “entrepreneurial bug” shows no signs of leaving anytime soon. Jess is also working on two more start-ups that are already close to launch: Jess is the founder of Toothbrush Supply, which sends a new toothbrush to your home every three months, and Dresscodable. Dresscodeable will finally put an end to the debate over the difference between “business casual” and “smart casual,” creating an easily sharable index of all dress codes for everything from company events to themed weddings.</p>\n\n<p>From lemonade stands to social media, Jess has a grip on what makes an idea powerful in this increasingly digital age. Throughout it all, Jess is driven by the limitless potential that inspired her to become an entrepreneur in the first place: “I’m convinced that with the right idea and the right team, anything is possible.” To learn more about Jess, follow her on Twitter: @ChiTownJess</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3656/103656v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,234],"assets/images/resized/0010/3656/103656v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,234],"assets/images/resized/0010/3656/103656v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jess Loren Popov</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Social Tech Pop","permalink":"social-tech-pop","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0010/8244/108244v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0010/8244/108244v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,164],"assets/images/resized/0010/8244/108244v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"Kambio Group","permalink":"kambio-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0016/9717/169717v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,118],"assets/images/resized/0016/9717/169717v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,118],"assets/images/resized/0016/9717/169717v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Chitown Deals","permalink":"chitowndeals-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0007/8002/78002v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0007/8002/78002v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0007/8002/78002v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Mix Media Solutions","permalink":"mix-media-solutions","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/2083/112083v2-max-150x150.tiff"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/2083/112083v2-max-250x250.tiff"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/2083/112083v2-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.reelchicago.com/story.cfm?storyID=2995","title":""},{"external_url":"http://midventureslaunch.com/speakers-panelists/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://2010rock.com/about-us/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.socialtechpop.com/about/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.toolboxforbiz.com/blog/best-marketing-tips-for-small-businesses.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.teenbusinessforum.com/start-up/forget-business-startup-loans-ridiculous-ways-raise-money-for-startup","title":""},{"external_url":"http://1000waystostartabusiness.tumblr.com/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.jessloren.com/press/","title":""}]}
