Over the past three years, I have learned the importance of hard work, drive, and passion in accomplishing what you strive for. Throughout this short time-frame I have started four companies, three of which have been successful through diligent effort and innovative business strategies. </p>\n\n<p>During each of my ventures I have learned how to build professional business plans, internal/external business strategies, and improve the leadership within the companies that I have consulted. Furthermore, I have applied my skill set to help my clients raise over $8.6 million during the last two years. Learning the equity side of banking through the non-traditional routes of reading and application, I feel that I have proven myself in my endeavors thus far. </p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to offer clients optimal service that is reinforced by industry experts that not only understand the dynamics of your business but can offer solutions that help your business grow more successful. Over the next few years we plan to use outside the box approaches to consistently grow our organizational presence and brand recognition throughout the U.S. marketplace.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"International Business, Finance and Spanish","institution":"Ramapo College of New Jersey","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://foundersblock.com/articles/creating-a-business-plan-that-successfully-raises-capital/","title":"Creating a Business Plan that Successfully Raises Capital"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=46106711&trk=tab_pro","title":"Ryan Kim"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?trk=hb_tab_pro_top","title":"Stratacution Ventures"}]}
