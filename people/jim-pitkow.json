He is also the Chair of the Demi and Ashton DNA Foundation Technical Task Force and an adviser to SV Angels.  In 2006, Jim advised Facebook on their ad targeting systems and helped found Anchor Intelligence (acq. Comscore) with Ron Conway.  Before that, he was the CEO of Moreover Technologies, the pioneering RSS and real-time news search company that was acquired by Verisign in 2005. </p>\n\n<p>Jim was the President and co-founder of Outride, a spinout from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), whose technology was acquired by Google in 2001. The company was the first to bring personalized search and contextual computing to commercial viability, demonstrating a 50+% reduction in the time it takes people - novices and experts alike - to find information on the Internet (see CACM link to the right).</p>\n\n<p>Jim was a research scientist at Xerox PARC and Chair of the World Wide Web Consortium&#8217;s Web Characterization Activity.  While at PARC, he worked with the User Interface Research (Dr. Stuart Card Manager) and Internet Ecologies (Dr. Bernardo Huberman Manager) groups which lead to dozens of patents and the publishing of &#8220;The Law of Surfing&#8221; in Science (see link).  With the help of Brewster Kahle, in 2006 he spearheaded the Web-in-a-Box project at PARC, the first such effort to store and analyze the entire Web on disk.</p>\n\n<p>He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1997. His dissertation, &#8220;Characterizing World Wide Web Ecologies&#8221; was one of the earliest dedicated towards empirically understanding the dynamics of the Web. In January 1994, while at Georgia Tech&#8217;s Graphics Visualization and Usability Center (GVU), Jim pioneered the field of online surveying by creating GVU&#8217;s World Wide Web User Surveys. This survey provided some of the earliest demographic data on Web users, covering topics including online commerce, privacy, politics, and the social impact of the Internet. The survey was cited by The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and CNN and featured in the PBS 1996 &#8220;Life on the Internet&#8221; series.  His first research paper, &#8220;Characterizing Browsing Strategies in the World-Wide Web&#8221; (see link) is the basis for online analytics and continues to invalidate tens of millions of dollars of patent lawsuits.  On GVU&#8217;s 15th Anniversary in 2007, GVU celebrated Jim&#8217;s contributions by making him an adviser and awarding him a GVU Impact Award.</p>\n\n<p>Jim graduated Cum Laude in Psychology from the University of Colorado in 1993. While there he worked for the Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) and coded the first integration of advanced search technology - latent semantic indexing (LSI) - into NCSA&#8217;s Web server for NASA&#8217;s Earth Observing System Distributed Information System (EOSDIS), one of the earliest uses of the Web within NASA.  </p>\n\n<p>Outside of work, Jim is a member of the National Ski Patrol, Northern California Search and Rescue, and is a certified yoga teacher in two lineages.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/6180/66180v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/6180/66180v1-max-250x250.png"],[[276,300],"assets/images/resized/0006/6180/66180v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Anchor
