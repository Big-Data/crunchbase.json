I led the first institutional rounds in RootMusic, the #1 entertainment app on Facebook; doxo, the premier digital filing cabinet; and VirtuOz, the leading virtual customer service company. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining Mohr Davidow, I started four companies, one of which was acquired by Hewlett Packard, another by Keynote Systems. Before that I was the youngest Technical Evangelist at Microsoft, promoting the then unknown Windows operating system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, my love for entrepreneurship took me back to starting my own companies, while continuing to advise and invest in others. I hold an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a BA Summa Cum Laude from Cornell University, where I was a Kodak Scholar.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/7929/27929v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,242],"assets/images/resized/0002/7929/27929v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[166,242],"assets/images/resized/0002/7929/27929v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David Feinleib / <a href=\"http://www.mdv.com\" title=\"MDV\" rel=\"nofollow\">MDV</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"Mohr Davidow Ventures","permalink":"mohr-davidow-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/9292/19292v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0001/9292/19292v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,176],"assets/images/resized/0001/9292/19292v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","firm":{"name":"Doxo","permalink":"doxo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0006/6034/66034v10-max-150x150.png"],[[208,80],"assets/images/resized/0006/6034/66034v10-max-250x250.png"],[[208,80],"assets/images/resized/0006/6034/66034v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
