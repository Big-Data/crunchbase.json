BOSS (Build an Open Search Service). He developed several supporting BOSS examples such as TweetNews and delicious.com&#8217;s Fresh homepage. As of April 2009, the number of queries issued through BOSS surpassed the search traffic on Ask, Amazon, and Facebook combined. MIT&#8217;s Technology Review listed him as one of the Top 35 under 35 Innovators of 2009 for his contributions to open search. Vik previously worked at Google and Microsoft, both in research and products, helping ship Google Custom Search and Windows XPSP2 Wireless Networking. While an undergraduate in college, he worked at Microsoft Research under Dr. Jim Gray, a legendary database guru and Turing Award Winner (who has been lost at sea since 2006), co-authoring a publication together about data mining the SkyServer logs. Vik graduated from UC Berkeley in Computer Science.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/8684/58684v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/8684/58684v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[286,374],"assets/images/resized/0005/8684/58684v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Zooies blog</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Entrepreneur-in-Residence","firm":{"name":"Sutter Hill Ventures","permalink":"sutter-hill-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,14],"assets/images/resized/0003/0838/30838v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0003/0838/30838v1-max-250x250.png"],[[432,41],"assets/images/resized/0003/0838/30838v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Site Architect, BOSS","firm":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.technologyreview.com/TR35/Profile.aspx?Cand=T&TRID=822","title":"MIT Technology Review: TR35 Award"},{"external_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/18/yahoo-boss-might-be-bigger-than-bing/","title":"TechCrunch: Yahoo!
