This being the nineties, with the media industry in a perceived state of hyper growth and upside only, she soon took her career into the ViaSat group and its marketing department. Then another media company caught her attention. Local player TvHuset needed someone to head up the accounting and cash management and she was more than happy to accept the challenge. Then one of Northzones (or as it was actually called during the early days &#8220;Venture Partners&#8221;) founders, Ingar Ã˜stby called. Was she interested in office management in the Venture Capital industry? Indeed.</p>\n\n<p>Off hours, you&#8217;ll win no prizes by guessing that this norwegian woman shares the general Oslo office&#8217;s love for the great outdoors, in Kristins case downhill skiing and running. But you&#8217;re equally likely to find her consumed by a interior design project or enjoying her music; anything goes, from Bocelli to Metallica. And despite her slim exterior, Kristin enjoys her cuisine.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The one thing, though, that you&#8217;ll not find me cooking, is the books.&#8221; she smiles.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0017/8481/178481v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0017/8481/178481v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0017/8481/178481v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Account Manager","firm":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
