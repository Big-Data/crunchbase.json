His research interests include neural modeling in software and hardware, and of late, machine learning algorithms and recommendation systems. Before Stanford, Brian spent six years at Sapient architecting enterprise applications in the financial, energy and government sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Brian splits his reading fairly evenly between fiction and non-fiction. In fiction, he likes primarily literature and humor (though he recently broke down and devoured the Harry Potters), while his non-fiction tastes vary widely, though geekana (e.g. The Cuckoo&#8217;s Egg, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach ), popular science (Kyusik would say &#8220;pseudo-science&#8221;) ( The Code Book, The Third Chimpanzee ), and Wall Street (try reading The Age of Turbulence with a straight face now!, Liar&#8217;s Poker ) are a few threads that run through his reading resume.</p>\n\n<p>Brian has been disappointed with his book social network site experience. If his friends weren&#8217;t writing lots of reviews, he wasn&#8217;t discovering new books to read. He&#8217;s strongly committed to helping readers find books they&#8217;ll love whether their friends are reading them or not!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0012/6122/126122v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,153],"assets/images/resized/0012/6122/126122v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,153],"assets/images/resized/0012/6122/126122v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Discovereads","permalink":"discovereads","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0012/6119/126119v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0012/6119/126119v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[265,57],"assets/images/resized/0012/6119/126119v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
