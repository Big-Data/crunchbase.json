Private investments included Real Networks, Inktomi, Alteon WebSystems, Centillium and Silicon Image.</p>\n\n<p>In the early &#8216;80&#8217;s, Andy spent 5 years at AT&amp;T Bell Labs as a chip designer, programmer, and spender of millions in regulated last minute, use it or lose it budget funds.

Every morning for 13 years, while heading out for the school bus, Andy looked to his left, up the hill, and checked out the flag flying at Middlebook Encampment, where George Washington and his troops spent winters watching the British troops in New Brunswick. On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress approved the Betsy Ross 13 star flag as the official flag, and it flew for the first time at the Middlebrook Encampment.
