After contributing to several external projects, he began pursuing his own endeavors.  Outscribes was a platform to connect content creators with providers, and Youlogy allowed users to create locked messages to their loved ones and enemies to be delivered posthumously.  We sold our user base for Outscribes and received an education about legal SNAFUs working on Youlogy.</p>\n\n<p>As early as 2007, the idea of solving the problem of effective language learning became a passion.  Loogla was born.  The past few years have been dedicated to becoming adept in multiple technologies, entrepreneurship, and computational linguistics.  By remaining focused and steadfast, Loogla is nearly ready to hatch.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 Tyler joined the prestigious Startup Chile incubator program.  He organized and ran their pitch training workshops, and organized several hugely successful events such as BizCamp Santiago &#8216;12 and the new high bar for remote broadcasts on This Week in Startups.</p>\n\n<p>This path has lead to what promises to be the next great innovation in online language learning with the launch of Loogla in fall 2012 and a return to the Bay Area.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/9707/199707v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/9707/199707v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/9707/199707v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Tyler Ulrich / <a href=\"http://loogla.com\" title=\"Loogla\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loogla</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Computer Information Systems","institution":"University of Nevada Reno","graduated_year":1999,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Application developer for Sierra Design Group","stoned_year":2004,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Tyler","last_name":"Ulrich","permalink":"tyler-ulrich"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
