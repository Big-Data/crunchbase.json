In 1982 having spent ten years in sales and marketing at East Coast-based IBM, Peter followed his entrepreneurial instincts and headed to the West Coast and the budding Silicon Valley. He decided it would be &#8220;much more fun to start a venture capital firm than join an existing one.&#8221; He founded Sierra Ventures, which has grown from a single California-based partner and a fledging fund of $16 million to over a dozen investing professionals, nine funds, and $1.5 billion in committed capital.</p>\n\n<p>Peter co-teaches Stanford University&#8217;s Graduate School of Business, &#8220;Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital&#8221; with Google CEO, Eric Schmidt. Peter has held this faculty appointment at Stanford since 1991 and has now taught &#8220;Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital&#8221; to more than 1,000 Stanford MBAs because &#8220;it&#8217;s a great way to stay connected to and help nurture the next wave of innovative companies.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>He has also been instrumental in applying his 25 years of U.S. VC experience to Sierra Ventures&#8217; entry into the new frontiers of India and China.</p>\n\n<p>Peter holds a BA from Princeton University and an MBA from Harvard. In addition to his venture capital activities at Sierra Ventures, Peter serves on the board of directors of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), as one of the three officers of Princeton University&#8217;s 40-member board of trustees, and recently completed an extended term as a member of the board of the Princeton University Investment Company (PRINCO), including six years as chairman during which time PRINCO&#8217;s professional managers grew the University&#8217;s endowment from $8 billion to over $16 billion. In recognition of his work at Stanford and Princeton, Peter was awarded the National Venture Capital Association&#8217;s American Spirit Award in front of 500 fellow venture capitalists &#8220;for applying his business skills in a manner that has created outstanding contributions to our broader society.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/4796/144796v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,182],"assets/images/resized/0014/4796/144796v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,182],"assets/images/resized/0014/4796/144796v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"","institution":"Princeton University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Harvard University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Sierra Ventures","permalink":"sierra-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/2271/72271v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/2271/72271v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[325,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/2271/72271v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","firm":{"name":"Merck & Co.","permalink":"merck-co-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/7814/47814v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[123,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/7814/47814v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[123,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/7814/47814v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Sierra Ventures","permalink":"sierra-ventures","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board of Directors","firm":{"name":"Princeton University Investment Company","permalink":"princeton-university-investment-company","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
