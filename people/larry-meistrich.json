In his triple role as Founder, Chairman of the Board, and Executive Officer of TSG, Meistrich was hands-on producer and an integral part of the production of roughly 100 films, commercials and music videos including the Academy Award-winning &#8220;Sling Blade&#8221; and the Academy Award nominated &#8220;You Can Count on Me&#8221;. Meistrich made industry history when Thornton&#8217;s &#8220;Sling Blade&#8221; was purchased by Miramax for a price that broke all previous sale records in independent film.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Source : <a href=\"http://www.nehst.com/index.php?page=bios\" title=\"Nehst\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nehst</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7179/17179v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/7179/17179v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/7179/17179v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman and Founder","firm":{"name":"NEHST Studios","permalink":"nehst-studios","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0011/6644/116644v1-max-150x150.png"],[[204,48],"assets/images/resized/0011/6644/116644v1-max-250x250.png"],[[204,48],"assets/images/resized/0011/6644/116644v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
