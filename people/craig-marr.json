He never imagined just how quickly and how far reaching the Web would change, not just the dynamics of direct marketing but business in general and communications as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Once hooked, Craig went on to help build two successful Web consulting and development firms, Poppe Tyson and US Interactive.  As the head of business development at both and later corporate development at US Interactive, Craig played an integral role in introducing this new medium into the boardrooms of several of the worldâ€™s leading companies like; IBM, Dean Witter, Chase Bank, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mellon Bank, ING Barings, Priceline, Lending Tree and several others.</p>\n\n<p>Craig also was a contributing author to the book; Mastering Web Design, which was a compendium of thought leaders in the early days of the Web covering everything from design, marketing and business strategy.  Craigâ€™s chapter touched upon the many ways that â€œBranding Applications,â€ as he termed them, would impact the way companies would attract and interact with prospects and customers alike.</p>\n\n<p>Says Craig; â€œThe Mobile space reminds me of the early days of the Web when new rules were being written and there was a sense of adventure as if we were discovering a new world.  The difference of course is now we realize that rather than a new world, this is just the world as it is and as it will be moving forward.â€</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Innovate M","permalink":"innovate-m","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/1129/121129v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/1129/121129v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/1129/121129v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
