Previously he worked at the blogging company <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/six-apart\" title=\"Six Apart\">Six Apart</a> for two years, both as the Open Platforms Tech Lead and more recently as a Director within their Corporate Development team.</p>\n\n<p>Recordon has played a pivotal role in the development and popularization of key social media technologies such as <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/openid-foundation\" title=\"OpenID\">OpenID</a>. In 2005, Recordon collaborated with <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-fitzpatrick\" title=\"Brad Fitzpatrick\">Brad Fitzpatrick</a> in the original development of OpenID, which has since become the most popular decentralized single-sign-on protocol on the web.</p>\n\n<p>During a year and a half at <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/verisign\" title=\"VeriSign\">VeriSign</a>, Recordon played an active role in refining and evangelizing OpenID, bringing it from an experimental technology to one that&#8217;s been endorsed by major companies ranging from <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/microsoft\" title=\"Microsoft\">Microsoft</a> to <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo\" title=\"Yahoo!\">Yahoo!</a>, and implemented for over one-billion identities on the web. </p>\n\n<p>Recordon&#8217;s history with open source software and open standards stretches back to the beginning of his career, when as a sophomore in high school he volunteered his time to lead an open source message board project with over forty members worldwide. This interest led to his co-founding of a message board hosting provider that still services tens of thousands of users around the world, and that he has since sold. </p>\n\n<p>Recordon was recognized by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/oreilly-media\" title=\"O&#8217;Reilly\">O&#8217;Reilly</a> as the recipient of a 2007 Open Source Award for his efforts with OpenID and is the youngest recipient in the history of the award.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, Recordon has helped to create OpenID and OAuth, now volunteers on the boards of the OpenID Foundation and Open Web Foundation, and is involved in the Activity Streams, Portable Contacts, PubSubHubbub and WebFinger communities. Recordon is also an advisor to the startup Superfeedr which is creating infrastructure technology for the realtime web.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6265/16265v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6265/16265v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6265/16265v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Community Board Member","firm":{"name":"OpenID Foundation","permalink":"openid-foundation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0001/6257/16257v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/6257/16257v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/6257/16257v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Open Programs Manager","firm":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and Director","firm":{"name":"Open Web Foundation","permalink":"open-web-foundation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/2680/22680v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/2680/22680v2-max-250x250.png"],[[401,131],"assets/images/resized/0002/2680/22680v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Superfeedr","permalink":"superfeedr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/9319/59319v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/9319/59319v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/9319/59319v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Innovator","firm":{"name":"VeriSign Authentication Services","permalink":"verisign","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0002/3928/23928v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,28],"assets/images/resized/0002/3928/23928v2-max-250x250.png"],[[344,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/3928/23928v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director, Corporate Development","firm":{"name":"Six Apart","permalink":"six-apart","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4339/4339v1-max-150x150.png"],[[96,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4339/4339v1-max-250x250.png"],[[96,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4339/4339v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubicgarden%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F903877%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Flj%2Dtoys%2Ecom%2F%3Fjournalid%3D1356357%26moduleid%3D18%26auth%5Ftoken%3Dsessionless%3A1210878000%3Aembedcontent%3A1356357%2618%3A3b2594390f2d22b96a8b2f08c1bd7af444fedad5source%3D3&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&brandname=blip%2Etv&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf\" width=\"400\" height=\"255\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" id=\"showplayer\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubicgarden%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F903877%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Flj%2Dtoys%2Ecom%2F%3Fjournalid%3D1356357%26moduleid%3D18%26auth%5Ftoken%3Dsessionless%3A1210878000%3Aembedcontent%3A1356357%2618%3A3b2594390f2d22b96a8b2f08c1bd7af444fedad5source%3D3&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&brandname=blip%2Etv&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"best\" /><embed src=\"http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubicgarden%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F903877%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Flj%2Dtoys%2Ecom%2F%3Fjournalid%3D1356357%26moduleid%3D18%26auth%5Ftoken%3Dsessionless%3A1210878000%3Aembedcontent%3A1356357%2618%3A3b2594390f2d22b96a8b2f08c1bd7af444fedad5source%3D3&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&brandname=blip%2Etv&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf\" quality=\"best\" width=\"400\" height=\"255\" name=\"showplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Ian Forrester interviews David Recordon at XTech</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
