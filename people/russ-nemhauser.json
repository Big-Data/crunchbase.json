He moved to the real estate industry in 1997, designing and programming systems for the management and leasing of commercial real estate and its investors. </p>\n\n<p>Moving to the online commerce industry in the late 1990&#8217;s provided a large foundation from which Mr. Nemhauser would make several notable accomplishments, including the online stores for Spencer Gifts, Captain Morgan Rum, the Universal Studios Store, the Crown Royal Gift Shop, and several others. </p>\n\n<p>Achieving success using technologies in both the open source and Microsoft camps, Russ then served as a Program Manager for Microsoft where he managed several vendors and interfaced with many different teams to bring Microsoft tools and technologies to students from all over the world. He oversaw the development of the Imagine Cup competition in 2005 as well as a large student social networking site. </p>\n\n<p>Returning to familiar territory in 2006, Mr. Nemhauser re-entered the entertainment industry and architected a home video production system for a major movie studio from the ground up. It was during this time that he developed a strong affinity for usability. </p>\n\n<p>Russ returned to Microsoft as a Senior Software Development Engineer the following year and became passionate and focused on code quality and testability. This served him well at MySpace, where he built an automated testing and quality reporting system to measure project, team, and developer quality over time.</p>\n\n<p>At lynda.com Russ works closely with Software Engineers and Architects to produce performant, scalable, secure code against a service-oriented architecture. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0005/1427/51427v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0005/1427/51427v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0005/1427/51427v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Engineering","firm":{"name":"lynda.com","permalink":"lynda-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/6414/36414v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/6414/36414v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0003/6414/36414v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Lead Software Engineer","firm":{"name":"CBS","permalink":"cbs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0001/8441/18441v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/8441/18441v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,95],"assets/images/resized/0001/8441/18441v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Program Manager","firm":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Web Platform Architect","firm":{"name":"MySpace","permalink":"myspace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Software Engineer","firm":{"name":"Universal Studios","permalink":"universal-studios","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,64],"assets/images/resized/0006/5970/65970v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[119,64],"assets/images/resized/0006/5970/65970v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[119,64],"assets/images/resized/0006/5970/65970v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
