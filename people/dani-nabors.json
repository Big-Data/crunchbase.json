Serving as the in-house analytics guru (and “keeper of all metrics”), she helps clients fully optimize, and understand the performance of, their ad campaigns - while also helping the company innovate effective, new ad platform products.</p>\n\n<p>Dani’s been in the keyword targeted/DR space since before Google existed - yes, there was such a time! Across her professional career she’s served on the agency, client and network sides, managing and optimizing diverse campaigns as an SEO, SEM, analytics and tracking expert. Prior to joining Future Ads, she served as Director of Web Publishing, Display and SEM at WebYES!; Sr. SEM Manager at Reunion.com; and Account Manager at Yahoo! Search Marketing.</p>\n\n<p>It’s no surprise this “analytical mind” hails from Germany, where she did her university work at Staatliche FH, Nuernberg, earning the equivalent of a degree in Business, Law and Administration. In her free time she likes to watch documentaries with her husband, while sipping healthy, vegetable juice drinks.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President, Campaign Analytics & Account Management","firm":{"name":"Future Ads","permalink":"future-ads","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0205/110205v8-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0011/0205/110205v8-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0011/0205/110205v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
