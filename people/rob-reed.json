Iâ€™ve been involved with raising more than $60 million of investment capital and generating more than $200 million in direct value.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently, I served as Vice President of Marketing and Government Relations for Zumbox, a web-based platform for the delivery of postal mail. Among other things, I developed key partnerships with the mayors of San Francisco, New York City, Minneapolis, and others. My experience with Zumbox as a location-based platform coupled with the revolution in smartphone technology inspired me to start MomentFeed.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m also the founder of Max Gladwell, a leading independent blog covering social media, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. Iâ€™ve been syndicated on more than 85 blogs including The Huffington Post, Mashable, and Treehugger. Iâ€™ve also been listed twice among the Top 100 Social Media and Internet Marketing Bloggers (#32).</p>\n\n<p>Between web-based ventures, I spent a couple years traveling the world and chasing winter to write The Way of the Snowboarder, a book on the history and people of the sport. I spent another three years in the biofuels industry. I was on the founding team of Earth Biofuels and Conserv Fuel, where I built Willie Nelsonâ€™s â€œBioWillieâ€ brand of biodiesel and worked with Julia Roberts on a clean school bus campaign that triggered a successful legislative initiative with California Senate Majority Leader Dean Florez.</p>\n\n<p>MomentFeed represents the culmination of my experience as an entrepreneur and marketer. We bridge the divide between marketers and the location-based services (LBS) industry through a mix of strategy, technology, and creative vision.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/4663/144663v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[214,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/4663/144663v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[257,300],"assets/images/resized/0014/4663/144663v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"MomentFeed","permalink":"momentfeed","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0014/1596/141596v3-max-150x150.png"],[[221,68],"assets/images/resized/0014/1596/141596v3-max-250x250.png"],[[221,68],"assets/images/resized/0014/1596/141596v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
