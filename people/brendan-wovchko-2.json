Acting as a strategic consultant for Sweden-based software start-up phpFox, Wovchko created the &#8220;Konsort&#8221; brand to appeal to the fast-growing â€œniche social networkâ€ space. After establishing phpFox&#8217;s U.S.-based operations Wovchko joined Sparta Social Networks, then the producer of the only licensable, enterprise-ready social network platform. </p>\n\n<p>In 2006 Wovchko returned to his roots as a technologist, purposing to develop meaningful technology solutions to serve the social media needs of music organizations and independent artists.  Wovchko co-founded ArtistData in 2005 and in 2006 co-founded Bandbox. After successfully launching both both products in Spring 2008, Wovchko turned his full focus to developing Bandbox. He continues to serve ArtistData as a member of their Board of Advisors.</p>\n\n<p>Wovchko resides in Nashville, TN with his wife and son and enjoys history, public speaking, and helping shape the debate on how technology and social media are shaping the future of music business. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0003/6492/36492v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0003/6492/36492v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0003/6492/36492v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"ArtistData","permalink":"artistdata","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/9792/19792v9-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/9792/19792v9-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/9792/19792v9-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Bandbox","permalink":"bandbox","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0005/8544/58544v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0005/8544/58544v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,100],"assets/images/resized/0005/8544/58544v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
