Prior to joining Zinio, Keith revamped the ecommerce department at Restoration Hardware and helped that company take its ecommerce revenue from $10M in FY02 to $150M+ in FY06, while reducing operational expenditures to less than 1% of gross revenue. He also pioneered the development of Restoration Hardware&#8217;s Direct-to-Consumer order management system that utilizes a rich media UI that integrates into its ecommerce platform. The in-store Flex-based OMS was handling over $250M in in-store personalized furniture orders. He&#8217;s also an accomplished writer and editor and wrote a regular column called &#8220;Web Scoop&#8221; for ZDNet&#8217;s Developer Channel from 1996 to 1999 where he wrote about emerging Internet trends, such as the evolution of ecommerce-enabled TV. Keith&#8217;s in-depth experience in both ecommerce and e-publishing is helping evolve Zinio&#8217;s technology platform. Keith is a graduate of Cal Poly, SLO.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7966/147966v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[209,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/7966/147966v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,358],"assets/images/resized/0014/7966/147966v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP, Technology R&D","firm":{"name":"Zinio","permalink":"zinio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/9313/19313v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/9313/19313v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/9313/19313v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
