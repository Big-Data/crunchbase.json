She still marvels at how unbelievably easy it was to dive into vibrant community involvement of all typesâ€”from joining her neighborhood association&#8217;s editorial force and the artonalberta.org board, to riding her bike while sporting an electric blue wig, leopard print coat and flowing purple boa, an act attracting exactly ZERO attention. After exhausting the limits of oh-so-practical degrees in French literature, philosophy and linguistics, teaching undergrads and grads, and launching an art gallery, Eve now spends billable hours writing and editing for a variety of clients. She fancies herself a reasonably successful worm rancher, singer and flower arranger, and is obsessed with discovering apostrophe and quotation markâ€™s â€œusage violationsâ€.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Contributor","firm":{"name":"Neighborhood Notes","permalink":"neighborhood-notes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.neighborhoodnotes.com/author/Eve%20Connell/","title":"Neighborhood Notes Blog"}]}
