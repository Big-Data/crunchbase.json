Born in 1957 in Innisfail, Queensland, Australia and the youngest of three children, Frank was always a fan of traveling and meeting new people. </p>\n\n<p>Because of Franks love of travel, he eventually developed hotelbackpacker.com and australiaisland.com While he was satisfied with these website&#8217;s, he felt he had more to offer. After doing tons of research and hard work, Frank registered Exploroo.com in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Using his previous business relationships, Frank assembled a team of motivated individuals to develop this new, travel themed social network.</p>\n\n<p>After months of hard work, Exploroo has developed into the website it is today! Frank still enjoys working on new projects, as well as spending time with his family and traveling.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[86,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/7534/47534v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[86,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/7534/47534v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[86,86],"assets/images/resized/0004/7534/47534v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Exploroo Pty Ltd","permalink":"exploroo-pty-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/7180/47180v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/7180/47180v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/7180/47180v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Xan Siam (Thailand) Ltd","permalink":"xan-siam-thailand-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
