He started the flagship site, theCHIVE in November 2008 with his brother Leo whom he shares the same love for ridiculously funny and bizarre photos. The premise behind theCHIVE was to curate the world&#8217;s best viral photos into specific galleries for easy viewing and sharing. theCHIVE now receives over 18M visitors and over 100M pageviews per month.</p>\n\n<p>John landed the role of Deputy Kevin Ellis on the hit HBO vampire drama, True Blood, in 2008. </p>\n\n<p>John and his brother Leo Resig recently gained quite a bit of attention for creating the story of â€œJenny DryEraseâ€ â€“ â€a girlâ€ who left her job by sending co-workers a series of photos where she uses a whiteboard to insult her boss and expose his fondness for Farmville.\nThe story aired on theCHIVE.com, a viral photo site run by the brothers, who own a series of photo/humor sites. Before that, the Resig brothers ran a site called Derober, which featured snarky photoshopped pics of celebrities.</p>\n\n<p>Deroberâ€™s moment in the spotlight came back in December 2007, when it made up a story about Donald Trump leaving a $10,000 tip on a $82.27 bill. The story was convincing enough to fool Fox News and the New York Post.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7146/97146v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/7146/97146v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/7146/97146v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & President","firm":{"name":"Resignation Media","permalink":"resignation-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/8278/168278v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0016/8278/168278v2-max-250x250.png"],[[432,288],"assets/images/resized/0016/8278/168278v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Owner & President","firm":{"name":"theCHIVE","permalink":"thechive","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7102/97102v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/7102/97102v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0009/7102/97102v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://thechive.com/","title":"theCHIVE"}]}
