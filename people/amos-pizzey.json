At the age of 14, Amos joined Georgeâ€™s band, Culture Club, and two years later signed his first international contract with Richard Branson at Virgin Records. </p>\n\n<p>Over the next two decades, Amos signed with multiple record labels, and was also producing and remixing artists like Madonna, George Michael and The Red Hot Chili Peppers during the dance music explosion.  It was during this time that he\nforged a close relationship with world top 10 DJ and producer, Jeremy Healy.  Merging their talents, the two had a series of hit records and created the multi-platform entertainment concept known as â€œBleachinâ€™â€, which tells the story of inner city club culture through film, fashion, art, music and photography.</p>\n\n<p>Amos and Jeremy went on to sign the project with BMG Records, and were photographed by Annie Leibovitz for American Vogue with John Galliano at his request.  In 2000, Amos was also a founding partner of Londonâ€™s Met Bar, which is became a global center for the worldâ€™s hottest artists. </p>\n\n<p>Amos was approached by the CEO of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi UK to serve as the founder and creative director of GUM connecting the youth market with global brands. During his two year tenure there, Amos worked with corporations like Procter &amp; Gamble and Atlantic Records, and was responsible for developing multi-platform brand campaigns as well as brokering entertainment and advertising deals. Shortly thereafter, Amos realized that the online community and the social networking sites that had exploded over the past few years lacked a purely creative destination where artists could create, collaborate, and liberate their talents together. The idea and concept behind Talenthouse was born. Amos left GUM to found the worldâ€™s first â€œAll Creative Online Communityâ€ and now serves as Founder and Creative Director of Talenthouse.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4037/64037v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/4037/64037v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/4037/64037v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://pages.talenthouse.de\" title=\"Talenthouse Media Kit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talenthouse Media Kit</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Talenthouse","permalink":"talenthouse","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/8701/48701v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/8701/48701v5-max-250x250.png"],[[300,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/8701/48701v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
