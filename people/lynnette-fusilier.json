Equipped with sharp communication skills and a keen eye for the cool, she quickly morphed into Pearlgirl, the go-to source for the skinny on neighborhood news, events and more. Always one to take the bull by the horns, Lynnette responded to the needs of her neighbors by founding Neighborhood Notes. (Read the complete uncensored NN story here!) Lynnette spends her free time (HA! Yeah, right.) biking around the city on her new birthday wheels, kicking booty in kickboxing, following Mack Brown Texas Football  [Hook &#8216;em, Horns!] and sipping bourbon at a variety of neighborhood establishments.
