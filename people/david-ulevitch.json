Ulevitch is the founder and CEO of OpenDNS and EveryDNS.</p>\n\n<p>David started OpenDNS in 2005 after identifying a need for a better performing, more secure DNS service than what was previously available to network administrators.</p>\n\n<p>David attended Washington University in St. Louis, where he earned a degree in anthropology. While at Washington University, David created one of the first DNS management companies, EveryDNS, to fill his need for web-based DNS management software. EveryDNS grew from a personal project to a service with nearly 100,000 users world-wide within a few years. David was also in part responsible for the creation and operations of the California Community Colocation Project, which provided free colocation services to over 130 non-profits and after merging with the Online Policy Group successfully sued Diebold Election Systems in Federal Court (see OPG v. Diebold).  David has an extensive background in networking and operations.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2393/22393v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/2393/22393v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/2393/22393v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>ZDNet</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Anthropology","institution":"Washington University in St. Louis","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / CEO","firm":{"name":"OpenDNS","permalink":"opendns","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"EveryDNS","permalink":"everydns","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[68,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/4398/54398v2-max-150x150.png"],[[68,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/4398/54398v2-max-250x250.png"],[[68,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/4398/54398v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Mentor","firm":{"name":"i/o Ventures","permalink":"ventures","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0007/2403/72403v2-max-150x150.png"],[[156,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/2403/72403v2-max-250x250.png"],[[156,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/2403/72403v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"OpenDNS","permalink":"opendns","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/prism-skylabs-refocuses-security-cams-into-productive-video-assets/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Prism Skylabs","permalink":"prism-skylabs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0014/3645/143645v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0014/3645/143645v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,347],"assets/images/resized/0014/3645/143645v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/blackjet/","source_description":"Uber Co-Founder Garrett Camp Launches BlackJet, The “Uber For Private Jets”","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":26,"company":{"name":"BlackJet","permalink":"blackjet","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0021/7474/217474v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0021/7474/217474v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,128],"assets/images/resized/0021/7474/217474v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://david.ulevitch.com/","title":"Personal Website"},{"external_url":"http://random.david.ulevitch.com/","title":"Blog"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/davidu","title":"Twitter"}]}
