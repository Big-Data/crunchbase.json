His career has taken him through many industries, writing simulation systems for defence, implementing and optimising models in finance to writing mobile applications and commercial web systems. An integration specialist, he has the ability to take many disparate systems and have them work together harmoniously, whether it be Facebook and mobile integrated with an online back end, any number of the Google APIâ€™s plugged together to build rich and compelling experiences, or maintaining several million lines-of-code systems in a production environment.</p>\n\n<p>Never one to shy from a complex technical problem, James relishes the opportunity to test his mettle using the latest and most appropriate technologies available in the trade. He believes in the mantra of maintainable code, being a keen proponent of test driven development, continuous integration and other techniques to keep productivity and quality to the highest standards.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,125],"assets/images/resized/0014/5618/145618v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[90,125],"assets/images/resized/0014/5618/145618v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[90,125],"assets/images/resized/0014/5618/145618v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor, Distiction","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor, Honours","subject":"Computer Systems Engineering","institution":"Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Tictrac","permalink":"tictrac","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/2936/142936v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0014/2936/142936v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0014/2936/142936v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
