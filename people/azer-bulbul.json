Earlier in his life he lived like a vagabond, and he quite liked it that way because he&#8217;s intrigued by underground lifestyles. While he&#8217;s someone who has always had a good sense of intuition, he credits these early experiences with strengthening his. Today he believes that it&#8217;s this quality that helps him make the various products for BeFunky so instinctual for its users.\nAzer&#8217;s curiosity about the many machines he was surrounded by in high school led to his first engagements with computers. He quickly got sucked into the programming field; he wrote codes with Commodore 64 and IBM, then later sold a significant amount of software. He believes that being a programmer that comes from an old-school, algorithmic background is part of what helps him to transfer ideas into the digital platform so well. Today Azer is very experienced in artificial intelligence type algorithms and focuses on flexibility while developing software.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0000/9631/9631v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,164],"assets/images/resized/0000/9631/9631v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,164],"assets/images/resized/0000/9631/9631v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Engineer","firm":{"name":"BeFunky","permalink":"befunky","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0000/0217/217v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,92],"assets/images/resized/0000/0217/217v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,92],"assets/images/resized/0000/0217/217v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
