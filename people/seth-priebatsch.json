At the age of 12, he founded his first web start-up. It failed gloriously, achieving profits several times those of Twitter. After completing his freshman year at Princeton (the official requirement to achieve the term dropout), Seth took a &#8220;leave-of-absence&#8221; to pursue SCVNGR, a geo-gaming technology platform which has 20 employees and powers interactive mobile experiences for hundreds of institutions in 46 states and 3 countries. As Chief Ninja of SCVNGR, Seth is solely responsible for corporate acquisition of all Nerf-based technologies.
