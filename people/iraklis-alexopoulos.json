I started my career as a software developer on rating/billing engines for network providers. I quickly moved to the enchanting world of the Internet and more specifically e-commerce, to become a web developer and later on manage complex projects and design software solutions. My goal is to be able to always participate in exciting and challenging projects - implementing or planning - working to provide the best quality of services. I always enjoy being surrounded by people who share the same attitude and vision. I try to create and be part of an environment where everyone can bring new ideas to the table and inspire innovative and out-of-the box thinking. I strongly believe that no sacrifice on the quality of the produced result should be made for the sake of speed. It is common knowledge that the amount of time you think you save to build something fast, you will end up spending it twice as much to fix what should have been built in the first place.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0021/7889/217889v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0021/7889/217889v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0021/7889/217889v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor (BSc)","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Athens University of Economic and Business Studies (AUEB)","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.cobone.com","title":"Cobone.com"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/IraklisAlex","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/iraklis.alexop","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/iraklisalexopoulos","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
