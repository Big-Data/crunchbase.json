His last involvement as Chief of Business Strategy was with Nivio a cloud computing startup which is targeting $12million in revenues this year, and which won Tech pioneer 2009 at the World Economic Forum (Davos).</p>\n\n<p>He likes to split his career into two segments, the first decade spent in building products, networks and systems, and the second half doing what he refers to as &#8216;excel sheets&#8217; meaning sales, marketing, pr, and bus dev. He has held roles ranging from systems admin to Chief Business Strategist, from CTO to CEO, but in all roles he claims he did the same job, either build a product or obtain customers.</p>\n\n<p>His claim to fame, as he puts it, is that every company that he has been involved in building, starting, funding, or simply being a &#8216;tea-boy&#8217;  is still in existence today, and making money.</p>\n\n<p>Currently he splits his time between advising startups in London (his 20% time), and for his sins he made it to the TC Europas shortlist, and the rest of his time is spent on http://www.Addpiks.com but that&#8217;s another story</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/6374/116374v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/6374/116374v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/6374/116374v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Iqbal Gandham</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MSc","subject":"Spacecraft Engineering and Satellite Communications","institution":"UCL","graduated_year":1994,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Addpiks","permalink":"addpiks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0019/7324/197324v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[155,54],"assets/images/resized/0019/7324/197324v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[155,54],"assets/images/resized/0019/7324/197324v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder & CTO","firm":{"name":"Net4india","permalink":"net4india","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief of Business Strategy","firm":{"name":"nivio","permalink":"nivio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,60],"assets/images/resized/0014/3497/143497v5-max-150x150.png"],[[134,60],"assets/images/resized/0014/3497/143497v5-max-250x250.png"],[[134,60],"assets/images/resized/0014/3497/143497v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Development Head","firm":{"name":"Onet","permalink":"onet","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.podtech.net/home/1348/","title":"Podcast Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.slideshare.net/iqbalgandham","title":"Slideshare"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/iqbalgandham","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/iqbalgandham","title":"Linkedin"}]}
