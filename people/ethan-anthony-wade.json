I seek to create a richer source of knowledge from past, present and future information on the world-wide web. In short, I&#8217;m that guy who wants to organize and add a consistent structure to all the information on the Internet. I envision a true web 3.0, and I aim to make it a reality.</p>\n\n<p>The Professional:\nInformation to knowledge is the next logical step and it is for this reason that I oversee the development of systems at XResults that aim to connect like information, regardless of location or source. With a diverse professional background that converges the field(s) of economics and software development, I&#8217;m adroit in the innovation of systems that take the world one step closer to a truly semantic web. Not always having a wealth of resources behind us, I&#8217;ve masterfully used outsourced as well as insourced professionals to achieve key development initiatives. With more than nine years in the emerging markets, I&#8217;ve been able to pretty much level the playing field.</p>\n\n<p>The Man:\nLead by example&#8230;. Inspiring people is what I do. My greatest pleasure in life comes from getting the most out of those around me. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Competitors come and go. Hot companies rise and fall. Money can flow out as quickly as it flows in. But what must not change are: vision, integrity, awareness, passion and pursuit.&#8221; </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>EA Wade on a recent conference call</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/7881/177881v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/7881/177881v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,350],"assets/images/resized/0017/7881/177881v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Ethan-Anthony Wade / <a href=\"http://www.xresults.com\" title=\"XResults Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow\">XResults Inc.</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Economics","institution":"George Washington University","graduated_year":1995,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"XResults Inc.","permalink":"xresults-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ulore.com","title":"uLore"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://ulore.com/hiq7cj","title":"LinkedIn Profile"}]}
