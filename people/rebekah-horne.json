With an entrepreneurial and aggressive spirit, Rebekah was a driving force, actioning the content and portals strategy which involved partnerships with Disney, eBay, EPL, NineMSN and MTV, and delivered an increase in content revenues of 400%, messaging revenues of 120% and data revenues of 340%.</p>\n\n<p>Tapping into an early understanding of the value of digital content and entertainment, Rebekah launched the first in-market TV on Mobile product at Optus with premium content partners such as ABC, ESPN, MTV and NBC.</p>\n\n<p>Having joined the Fox Interactive Media team Australia &amp; New Zealand in 2006, this role combined Rebekahâ€™s passion for digital technology and content, with the challenge of building a business from the ground-up within a very new sector. Reporting to the MD International she was responsible for the launch and growth strategy of Fox Interactive Media Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p>Success followed, Rebekah grew revenues by 345% YOY FYâ€™08, maintained 20-30% margin FYâ€™07 &amp; FYâ€™08, launched and built the company to 60 FTEâ€™s by January â€˜08 and maintained #1 Website in market MySpace and IGN FYâ€™07 and FYâ€™08.</p>\n\n<p>Capping off an impressive stint in the Australian &amp; New Zealand markets, Rebekah is now heading to Europe to add to her role in the Australian and New Zealand markets as Managing Director, Europe for Fox Interactive Media. In this role she will lead a team of Country Managers and will be responsible for developing and implementing the strategic direction for Europe as well as being accountable for carrying out the vision for the European team.</p>\n\n<p>When discussing the opportunities at Fox Interactive Media, Rebekah explains â€œAs the global leader in advertiser integration, one challenge and opportunity I see is to grow the overall share of online advertising budgets compared to traditional media. It still amazes me that whilst overall online budgets grow year on year, traditional media with fragmented audiences that offer flat non-integrated solutions and push messages at consumers with little to no way of measuring any user interaction, still receive the majority of global advertising budgets. I look forward to the broader industry having the â€œah haâ€ moment that some advertisers have had. In the meantime, MySpace will continue to evolve its advertising and consumer proposition and deliver relevant products for users and clientsâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Rebekah is currently completing her MBA from the University of New South Wales, Australia and has achieved a Bachelor of Business, from the University of Technology, majoring in Economics and Marketing.</p>\n\n<p>Social responsibility is important to Rebekah, who currently sits on the board of The Oaktree Foundation, an organisation with a mission to empower and sustainably develop communities through education. Rebekah is also proactive in supporting organisations that improves peoples and animals lives.</p>\n\n<p>Recent examples of Rebekahâ€™s social advocacy include the Australian Federal Policeâ€™s â€˜Missing Persons Programâ€™ and Girlfriend magazineâ€™s â€˜Anti-bullyingâ€™ campaign, as well joining with MP Clover Moore to launch â€˜Lead The Wayâ€™, a public campaign in support of the Animals (Regulation of Sales) Bill, which aimed to regulate the sales of cats and dogs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,97],"assets/images/resized/0005/3095/53095v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[103,97],"assets/images/resized/0005/3095/53095v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[103,97],"assets/images/resized/0005/3095/53095v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"TopFloor","permalink":"topfloor","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0021/5558/215558v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0021/5558/215558v1-max-250x250.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0021/5558/215558v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP International","firm":{"name":"MySpace","permalink":"myspace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rebekah-horne/2/b8a/747","title":"Linkedin"}]}
