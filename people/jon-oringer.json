He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Math and Computer Science from Stony Brook University, and completed his Master&#8217;s degree in Computer Science at Columbia University.\nOringer pioneered the subscription based microstock photography business model when he created Shutterstock in 2003. Jon Oringer originally founded the company to sell his own images, but soon recognized that his work alone would not satisfy his customers&#8217; demand. In response, Jon Oringer decided to become an agent as well, so he could offer other people&#8217;s work as a complement to his own. By combining a personal interest in photography with a first hand knowledge of the demand for diverse and compelling imagery in today&#8217;s marketplace, Jon Oringer set out to provide high quality photographs in a way that he thought would make sense to his customers.\nThe company has enjoyed robust growth since its inception; it grew from 30,000 royalty-free stock images in 2003 to over 11 million in February 2010, and over 18 million in April, 2012. In 2009, Oringer was selected 41st on the Silicon Alley 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential entrepreneurs, investors, executives, and technologists in Manhattan.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/8726/158726v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/8726/158726v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/8726/158726v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master of Science","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Columbia University","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science ","subject":"Computer Science and Mathematics","institution":"State University of New York at Stony Brook","graduated_year":1997,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder | CEO","firm":{"name":"Shutterstock","permalink":"shutterstock","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0003/6397/36397v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/6397/36397v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,90],"assets/images/resized/0003/6397/36397v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Bigstock","permalink":"bigstockphoto","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/0606/60606v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0006/0606/60606v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0006/0606/60606v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"This company doesn't exist ","firm":{"name":"Longitude Trading LLC","permalink":"longitude-trading-llc","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Bigstock","permalink":"bigstockphoto","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0006/0606/60606v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0006/0606/60606v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0006/0606/60606v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.smartmoney.com/Spending/Technology/Small-Business-How-to-Beat-a-Goliath/","title":"Small Business: How to Beat a Goliath/Smart Money Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/11/24/focus2.html?page=2","title":"Whether You're Financing a Cause or a Career, Case Can Be Found on the Internet/Phoenix Business Journal"},{"external_url":"http://www.microstockdiaries.com/jon-oringer.html","title":"Microstock Celebrity - Jon Oringer/Microstock Diaries"},{"external_url":"http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/content_display/features/featured-in-print/e3i0731a974271226255ad9e476eea06f6c","title":"Micro Machines - Photo District News"},{"external_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/sa100/2008/jon-oringer","title":"Silicon Alley Insider/Silicon Alley 100 "},{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204883304577221273401669372.html#slide/1","title":"WSJ Article about Jon Oringer"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.shutterstock.com/","title":"Shutterstock"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/shutterstock","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/shutterstock","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shutterstock/8333641277","title":"Facebook"}]}
