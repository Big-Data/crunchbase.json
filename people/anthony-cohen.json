Its a permanently evolving and fascinating project. Relevancy is the real holy grail of the web, and no one else can do it like us.</p>\n\n<p>We havent even launched to a targeted community yet. Were still Alpha-testing the platform, and yet weve somehow accrued over a thousand users in 60 countries. Architects are using it to exchange ideas on sustainable design, musicians are sharing their latest tracks, companies are setting up groups to engage with their clients, and what&#8217;s really exciting to me is that the communities are starting to emerge and work together</p>\n\n<p>Prior to this I started Primall Media in October 2004 from an idea that the best place to advertise is closest to the purchase decision. This new company was focused on acquiring the advertising rights in the major shopping centers of South Africa.\nThe company started with an initial investment of R150 000. In October 2004 I structured a deal that offloaded the initial investor and acquired as partner the largest player in alternative media space in South Africa, Primedia Ltd. On departing I started to gather a think-tank for the MyGeni concept in 2009. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0009/2137/92137v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0009/2137/92137v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0009/2137/92137v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
