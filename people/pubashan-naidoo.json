My website will crack a specific market I choice within two weeks when it generally takes 3-5 weeks for google to index you website. What can I say when you good you good:-). You must be wondering how I do that. Well you know the saying a magician does not give await his secrets. In this case me tooJ. Ok I will share with you just one. It is by understanding how google really works. Google works in three ways. First google uses Googlebot(aka Google&#8217;s Web Crawler) which finds and retrieves pages on the web and hands them off to the google indexer. Secondly Googlebot gives the indexer the full text of the pages it finds, which is then stored alphabetically in Google&#8217;s index database. Last but not least Google uses Google&#8217;s Query processor, this has several part including the search box/search interface that evaluates queries and matches them to the relevant documents and the results formatter. In addition PageRank is Google&#8217;s system for ranking web pages. A page with a higher Pagerank is deemed more important and is more likely to be listed above the page with a lower PageRank. Well that all the secrets Iâ€™m going to give away today kids. That was just a brief understanding of how Google operates.</p>\n\n<p>I have +- 2years in Search Engine Optimization(SEO) experiences.
