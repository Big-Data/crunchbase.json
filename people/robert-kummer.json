As part of his role, Mr. Kummer managed the development of the companyâ€™s information systems infrastructure â€“ the platform making this innovative business model possible.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Kummer helped found eBondUSA.com, an online municipal bond dealer focused on the interdealer market. He served as the companyâ€™s financial principal and took the company from its formation through registration with the NASD as a broker-dealer. Mr. Kummer held NASD registrations as Series 7 (representative), Series 24 (securities principal), Series 27 (financial &amp; operations principal), and Series 53 (municipal securities principal). He also served as project manager and principal architect for the companyâ€™s clearing and settlement system.</p>\n\n<p>From 1994 to 1998, Mr. Kummer served as the Chief Financial Officer of Agincourt, Ltd. At Agincourt, he supported the firmâ€™s investment banking activities for both taxable and tax-exempt issuers, project finance, business financial management, and strategic planning. Working with a specialty insurer in Bermuda, he helped develop a program designed to effectively segregate and securitize credit risk from the tax-exempt interest feature of municipal securities within IRS guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>From 1991 to 1993, he was recruited into the CFO role for Discovery Corporation, a financially troubled consumer products manufacturing firm located in Vancouver, Washington. By rationalizing its product line and very carefully managing vendor relationships, he was able to turn the business around without the need for outside capital.
