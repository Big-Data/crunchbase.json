His mother, a PK (thatâ€™s pastorâ€™s kid to you) was a piano playing school teacher and father, a self-made man with his own casket distribution company who encouraged his son, not to follow in his footsteps.  Growing up during the video boom, the birth of MTV exposed Zeke to the art of filmmaking at an early age.  Fresh and exhilarating, it was like nothing heâ€™d seen before.  Fearing the worst, Zekeâ€™s parents thought MTV was evil so they canceled the cable subscription leaving him high and dry without a muse.  But it was too late.</p>\n\n<p>Barely out of high school, Zeke joined Detroitâ€™s Public Television to direct/produce for their original programs.  Two degrees later and a trip around the globe, he transitioned to the high-paced world of advertising, producing for a successful Midwest ad agency.  2003, Zeke burned his suit â€˜n tie and relocated to L.A.  His work has won top honors at the Houston Worldfest, New York Festival, Flagstaff Intâ€™l Festival and 7 National Telly Awards. In â€˜10, his screenplay, â€œhappiness no. 3â€ took 2nd round (beating more than 4000+ scripts) in the Austin Film Festival Screenplay Competition.</p>\n\n<p>Each year, armed only with a still camera and notebook, Zeke drives cross-country with his three cats, finding new stories to share, meeting new characters and arriving one step closer at knowing himself.  Making discoveries on the way, great or small that never cease to surprise and always amaze at the power of integrity and the human spirit inside us all.  Excelling in storytelling, Zeke is sure to find those moments (sometimes, off-beat) that make up who we are and relate to in a personal way.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/3991/23991v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[183,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/3991/23991v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[330,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/3991/23991v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Zeke Anders / (http://www.zekeanders.com)</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BFA","subject":"Fine Arts","institution":"Center for Creative Studies","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MFA","subject":"Film Production","institution":"York","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director/Partner","firm":{"name":"Non-Member Films","permalink":"non-member-films","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/3850/23850v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/3850/23850v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[404,188],"assets/images/resized/0002/3850/23850v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","firm":{"name":"Arsenal","permalink":"arsenal","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
