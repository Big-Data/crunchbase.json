Having spent half of her career in London and the other half in the U.S., Cheryl is well-versed in both the European and American business landscapes.  </p>\n\n<p>Cheryl started March to provide both clients and agency teams with a service and environment that is open, innovative and inspiring.  Marchâ€™s approach to social media is driven by Cherylâ€™s firm belief that all media is social and a good campaign isnâ€™t about separating traditional media from social media, itâ€™s about integrating them.  </p>\n\n<p>Cheryl began her career at The Weber Group (now Weber Shandwick), where she helped set up the firmâ€™s London offices.  She later moved to Band &amp; Brown in the UK to set up their technology division, putting the firm on the map for creative high-tech public relations campaigns.  Cheryl has been the team lead for several large accounts, including Cisco, LogicaCMG, and BT, leading their EMEA and U.S. PR efforts, and in some cases coordinating the work of more than 20 agencies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2568/82568v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2568/82568v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,448],"assets/images/resized/0008/2568/82568v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"March Communications","permalink":"march-communications","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/5415/75415v16-max-150x150.png"],[[247,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/5415/75415v16-max-250x250.png"],[[247,70],"assets/images/resized/0007/5415/75415v16-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.prweekus.com/an-agency-search-mirrors-a-job-interview/article/176552/","title":"An agency search mirrors a job interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.prweekus.com/strong-agencyclient-relationships-provide-value/article/176728/","title":"Strong agency/client relationships provide value"}],"web_presences":[]}
