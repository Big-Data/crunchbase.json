She&#8217;s amalgamation of creation, analysis and technology. She has bridged the divide between mobile, technology and music to create and define the space of iPad music production and performance as The iPad DJ. She has performed over 100 shows in front of nearly 80,000 people in the past year for innovative companies such as Apple, Disney, Wired, Google and Kia Motors. </p>\n\n<p>She began her love affair with music at age 6, beginning with piano, building with viola, and crystallizing with guitar and audio engineering. A student of jazz guitar and audio production, Rana June has worked with some of the top minds in the music industry, helping to shape their mobile and digital strategies while continuing to grow and define her own musical style. </p>\n\n<p>As co-founder of Medialets, the largest in-application analytics and advertising platform for the iPhone, Rana June has been deeply involved in the successful design, implementation, and execution of comprehensive iPhone application marketing campaigns for products across the industry since the very beginning of the space, and was among the first to promote app marketing as a discrete practice.  She has coached mobile application developers at every level: solo developers; indie development shops; creative and media buying agencies; and large, venture-backed application firms.
