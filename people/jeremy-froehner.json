GetUnbored is a picture-based city and event guide, which uses categorized images instead of text to search.  GetUnbored has partnered with Citysearch and Ticketmaster to connect users to over 15 million business listings and hundreds of local daily events.  GetUnbored users can search for businesses, &#8220;events &amp; activitiesâ€ and even restaurants using these images. </p>\n\n<p>GetUnboredâ€™s goal is to simplify the search for businesses, local activities and events for the millions of people, who are not computer savvy, are new to English and those who are overwhelmed with too much data. Their plan is to acquire this visually oriented market and provide them the tools to think of new things to do and places to go. GetUnbored accomplishes this through its visual-based search engine that provides a faster and easier alternative to the traditional text-based search.  The company strongly believes that images are a faster way of communication, can break language barriers and are recognizable by a wider audience. Additionally, GetUnbored users can save, promote and share favorite places and events with a shareable calendar and integrated Facebook networking.  </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
