In 1995 he developed FreeVue, a low-bitrate video conferencing system for Internet-connected PC&#8217;s, resulting in the acquisition of his company in early 1996 by RealNetworks. For 3 1/2 years, Rosedale served at RealNetworks as Vice President and CTO, where he was responsible for the development and launch of RealVideo, RealSystem 5.0, and RealSystem G2. In 1999 Rosedale returned to San Francisco, joined Accel Partners as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence, and began the basic research that would become the technology behind Linden Lab. Rosedale holds a BS degree in Physics from the University of California at San Diego.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/3165/23165v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/3165/23165v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,320],"assets/images/resized/0002/3165/23165v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>TechCrunch</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Physics","institution":"University of California, San Diego","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Love Machine","permalink":"love-machine","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0006/6446/66446v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,105],"assets/images/resized/0006/6446/66446v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,159],"assets/images/resized/0006/6446/66446v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","firm":{"name":"Linden Lab","permalink":"secondlife","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0001/0932/10932v5-max-150x150.png"],[[200,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/0932/10932v5-max-250x250.png"],[[200,35],"assets/images/resized/0001/0932/10932v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Coffee & Power","permalink":"coffee-power-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Real Networks","permalink":"realnetworks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[83,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/1291/21291v2-max-150x150.png"],[[83,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/1291/21291v2-max-250x250.png"],[[83,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/1291/21291v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Soundtracker","permalink":"soundtracker","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0006/8519/68519v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/8519/68519v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,96],"assets/images/resized/0006/8519/68519v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/26/milk-completes-1-5-million-angel-round-packed-with-valley-names/","source_description":"Milk Completes $1.5 Million Angel Round, Packed with Valley Names","raised_amount":1500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":4,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Milk","permalink":"milk","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/2095/132095v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0013/2095/132095v1-max-250x250.png"],[[361,203],"assets/images/resized/0013/2095/132095v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://yourstory.in/2012/03/sunglass-io-raises-usd-1-7-million-from-general-catalyst-partnersmitch-kapor-and-others/","source_description":"Sunglass.io Raises USD 1.7 Million from General Catalyst Partners, Mitch Kapor And Others","raised_amount":1800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":16,"company":{"name":"Sunglass","permalink":"sunglass","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/0694/190694v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/0694/190694v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/0694/190694v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
