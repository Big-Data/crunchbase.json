Understanding the influence that SEO has on your business is critical, SEO can help you win-over new customers and persuade existing customers. If your companyâ€™s website is not fully optimized then your website is absolutely having a negative impact on your bottom line. Think of SEO this way; when a visitor comes to your website they will take one of two actions. That visitor to your website will either buy a product or fill out a form (i.e. take action), or they will leave (i.e. bounce). They may view some of the pages in your site, but if your site is not search engine optimized then the amount of visitors â€˜bouncingâ€™ off your website will greatly outnumber those who are â€˜taking actionâ€™.</p>\n\n<p>Google Adwords - Pay Per Click\nGoogle Adwords, commonly known as pay per click or PPC advertising is the fastest method for driving instant traffic to your website or blog. Although a fast and effective Internet marketing tool that will increase your website or blogs traffic, Google Adwords pay per click advertising is not a task you should give to an inexperienced employee.
