Mainly it is venture capital &amp; private equity, but I also work with other investment programs (capital lines, PIPE deals, microfinance etc.). Briefly, I work in 3 directions: (1) investor relationship management (raising capital, creating &amp; negotiating investment programs, reporting to investors, issues &amp; conflicts settlement); (2) business analysis (identifing prospective investment areas &amp; projects, consulting project authors and shaping up business model, financial planning &amp; budgeting) and (3) project management (advisory, monitoring &amp; control). At the BA&amp;PM side, I work with Ukrainian companies &amp; entrepreneurs. At the IR side, I work with foreign investors (individual, corporate, institutional) who interested in putting their money to work in Ukraine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/3304/53304v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/3304/53304v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/3304/53304v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master","subject":"Applied Mathematics and Information Science","institution":"Pre-Azov State Technical University","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal","firm":{"name":"Fronteza","permalink":"fronteza","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Project Manager","firm":{"name":"Luxoft","permalink":"luxoft","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0008/8335/88335v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/8335/88335v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,80],"assets/images/resized/0008/8335/88335v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Business Analyst","firm":{"name":"PJSC Azovstal","permalink":"pjsc-azovstal","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/usoltsev","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/oleg.usoltsev","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.naymz.com/search/oleg/usoltsev/1573286","title":"Naymz"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/Usoltsev","title":"Twitter"}]}
