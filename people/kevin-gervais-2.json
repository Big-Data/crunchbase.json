Kevin founded Spry Agency Inc. at age 22 in September 2009 and with the help of two partners has grown revenue 300% by its second year in business while building a profitable business model. Spry currently is debt-free with positive cash flow while avoiding the use of credit.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin has a particular interest in how the Internet can be used to solve everyday problems, like where to go to class and what to do this weekend with friends. He spends his time drinking Red Bull, researching emerging trends and keeping track of the over 30,000 emerging apps that can be leveraged to do amazing things in real life. He believes that any great product needs to begin with a market that is looking for a solution, and you&#8217;ll often find him asking fellow residents or business owners every day what type of solution they are looking for. </p>\n\n<p>Kevin&#8217;s specialty is on building an ecosystem, seeing where startups can interact with other web properties as well as how the new apps of the future will connect with the things people do every day. The best apps, he feels, are the ones that work behind the scenes - ones that you can trust are looking out for you.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0014/4827/144827v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,208],"assets/images/resized/0014/4827/144827v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,374],"assets/images/resized/0014/4827/144827v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Spry Agency","permalink":"spry-agency","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,104],"assets/images/resized/0014/4815/144815v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0014/4815/144815v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,312],"assets/images/resized/0014/4815/144815v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"DateInMind","permalink":"dateinmind","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0015/2163/152163v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2163/152163v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,270],"assets/images/resized/0015/2163/152163v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.windsorstar.com/business/Accelerator+gears/4841166/story.html","title":"Launching a Business Accelerator in Windsor, Ontario"},{"external_url":"http://fuelawards.ca/entry/4529071-Spry-Agency-Inc.","title":"FuEL Awards Young Entrepreneur - Kevin Gervais"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/kevinbrucegervais","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=30781714","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
