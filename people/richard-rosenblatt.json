A serial entrepreneur, Richard&#8217;s latest venture is <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/demandmedia\" title=\"Demand Media\">Demand Media</a>, a company he co-founded in May 2006 and serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Demand Media has developed a unique platform that leverages cutting edge, user-driven publishing, community, and monetization tools as it seeks to define the next generation of new media companies.</p>\n\n<p>Richard has built, operated, and sold over $1.3 billion of Internet media companies. Most recently, he served as Chief Executive Officer of Intermix Media, Inc. (Amex: MIX) and Chairman of Myspace.com. Joining Intermix in March 2004, Richard led a successful turn-around of its existing business, helped the management team grow Myspace.com from an unknown web site to one of the most popular properties on the Internet, developed a number of new Internet media properties, and significantly increased shareholder value. During his eighteen months as CEO of Intermix, its public market capitalization grew from $70 million to over $650 million, when it was acquired by News Corporation (NYSE: NWS) in October, 2005.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, Richard sold iMALL (NASDAQ: iMAL), a company he founded in 1994 and served as Chairman and CEO, to Excite@Home (NASDAQ: ATHM) for $565 million. iMALL&#8217;s success was due to an early recognition of the power of user generated content (UGC). iMALL offered users a suite of tools which enabled them to build their own eCommerce stores and transact commerce over the Internet. In addition to these two public Internet companies, Richard has been actively involved in a number of private internet companies. He also serves as non-executive chairman of iCrossing, a leading digital and natural search firm.</p>\n\n<p>Richard is a Southern California native, with a B.A. from UCLA and J.D. from USC Law school (class of 1994). He is married with three children and active in the community.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/1699/21699v1-max-150x150.png"],[[223,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/1699/21699v1-max-250x250.png"],[[245,274],"assets/images/resized/0002/1699/21699v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://frankschilling.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/04/april_dnj_cover.html\" title=\"Frank Schilling\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frank Schilling</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"","institution":"UCLA","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"J.D.","subject":"","institution":"USC Law School","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO","firm":{"name":"Demand Media","permalink":"demandmedia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0000/0247/247v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/0247/247v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0000/0247/247v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Livestrong","permalink":"livestrong","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0001/6721/16721v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,23],"assets/images/resized/0001/6721/16721v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,23],"assets/images/resized/0001/6721/16721v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman","firm":{"name":"MySpace","permalink":"myspace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Intermix Media","permalink":"intermixmedia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/1778/21778v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[104,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/1778/21778v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[104,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/1778/21778v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/03/factual-1-million-seed/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"Factual","permalink":"factual","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0006/2569/62569v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0006/2569/62569v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,118],"assets/images/resized/0006/2569/62569v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.richard.tv/","title":"Richard's Channel"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/demandrichard","title":"Twitter"}]}
