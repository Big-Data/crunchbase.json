The company has been profitable every single month since its inception and is actively involved in publishing &amp; marketplaces for Web Professionals.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, Matt has spun off 99designs out of SitePoint as its own seperate business. 99designs has become the market leader in crowdsourced graphic design and currently sees a new graphic uploaded to the site every 5 seconds and pays out over $1,500,000 to designers every month. </p>\n\n<p>99designs has run crowdsourced design projects for tens of thousands of small business owners, as well as big brands like Adidas, TiVo, Dish Networks, Wikipedia, and bestselling authors like Tim Ferriss and Rick Warren (author of &#8220;The Purpose Driven Life&#8221;). </p>\n\n<p>99designs raised $35 million from Accel Venture Partners, Michael Dearing / Harrison Metal, Dave Goldberg (SurveyMonkey), Anthony Casalena, and Stewart Butterfield (Flickr).</p>\n\n<p>In June of 2009, Matt and his business partner Mark Harbottle launched Flippa.com, a marketplace for buying and selling small websites via auction.
