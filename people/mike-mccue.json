Together they set out to build a global service that would let people make all of their news, photos, and videos from across social networks accessible from a single place.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2010, they launched Flipboard for iPad: a social magazine that brings people the most informative, entertaining and amazing stories from around the world and from their daily life. With each flip, people can learn about stories and events that take place thousands of miles away or right at home; see life’s great moments in one place; and be inspired by what others share. Today, Flipboard works across iPad, iPhone and Android.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, Mike founded <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/tellme\" title=\"Tellme Networks\">Tellme Networks</a>, one of the world&#8217;s largest Internet networks for voice communication. He successfully led the integration of the companyâ€™s technology into Microsoftâ€™s infrastructure following its acquisition. Microsoft bought Tellme in 2007 for $800 million.</p>\n\n<p>Before founding Tellme, Mike worked at <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/netscape\" title=\"Netscape\">Netscape</a>  as Vice President of Technology. He joined Netscape after their successful acquisition of the first company he founded, Paper Software, a leader in 3-D browser technology. Mike was honored with a Kilby International Award as a Young Innovator for his work bringing 3-D technology to the world through Netscape&#8217;s Web browser.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/7024/47024v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[223,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/7024/47024v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[223,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/7024/47024v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Flipboard.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Flipboard","permalink":"flipboard","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-150x150.png"],[[198,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-250x250.png"],[[300,377],"assets/images/resized/0008/6174/86174v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO, Founder","firm":{"name":"Tellme","permalink":"tellme","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/4834/44834v3-max-150x150.png"],[[142,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/4834/44834v3-max-250x250.png"],[[142,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/4834/44834v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Technology","firm":{"name":"Netscape","permalink":"netscape","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7667/27667v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7667/27667v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7667/27667v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"General Manager, Tellme Networks","firm":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board","firm":{"name":"Twitter","permalink":"twitter","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0000/2755/2755v33-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"c","source_url":"","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Crowd Technologies","permalink":"crowd-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0002/2760/22760v2-max-150x150.png"],[[219,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/2760/22760v2-max-250x250.png"],[[219,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/2760/22760v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://news.yahoo.com/social-yearbook-company-treering-raises-3-6-million-130956585.html","source_description":"Social Yearbook Company, TreeRing, Raises $3.6 Million in Series A Funding","raised_amount":3600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":25,"company":{"name":"TreeRing","permalink":"treering","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0008/1819/81819v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0008/1819/81819v3-max-250x250.png"],[[262,92],"assets/images/resized/0008/1819/81819v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[{"description":"Joined Board of Directors of Twitter","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":15,"source_url":"http://blog.twitter.com/2010/12/stocking-stuffer.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Twitter Blog: Meaningful Growth","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"McCue","permalink":"mike-mccue"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
