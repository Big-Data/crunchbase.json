He has more than 12 years of experience in the IT industry and has managed dozens of software development projects. He also founded Logic Software in 1999, and Easy Projects .NET in 2003 as a way for non-professional project managers to create, manage and update projects quickly and easily. The software also helps distributed project teams to work together more effectively. These tools have helped Logic Software grow into an international software company with offices in Canada and Europe. </p>\n\n<p>Katcherovski studied computer science in Belarus and then became a network administrator and Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer. But he realized that he preferred interacting with people over machines. â€œSo I decided to start my own software company, got in contact with some of my friends in the USA who were looking for applications to be developed, and I never looked back again,â€ he said.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8802/128802v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0012/8802/128802v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0012/8802/128802v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>LinkedIn Profile</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Computer Science","subject":"","institution":"Belarussian State University of Information & Radioelectronics","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/vadim-katcherovski/0/654/bbb","title":""}]}
