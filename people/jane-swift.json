Formerly the Governor of Massachusetts from 2001 to 2003, after having served as Lieutenant Governor as well as a Massachusetts State Senator, Jane has shown a continued commitment to excellence in public education as both an elected official and in the private sector. As a three-term state senator, Jane assisted in crafting the landmark Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993, which introduced accountability, high standards, and innovation into Massachusettsâ€™s public schools. As governor, she implemented many of these reforms, which proved so successful that the U.S. Department of Education declared it a national model for other states to follow in 2003.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0015/2140/152140v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,130],"assets/images/resized/0015/2140/152140v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,130],"assets/images/resized/0015/2140/152140v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"American Studies","institution":"Trinity College","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","firm":{"name":"Middlebury Interactive Languages","permalink":"middlebury-interactive-languages","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0015/2138/152138v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[224,123],"assets/images/resized/0015/2138/152138v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[224,123],"assets/images/resized/0015/2138/152138v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
