He graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1967 and its Law School in January 1971. He temporarily left law school in 1968 to serve six months in the Army reserves during the Vietnam War.</p>\n\n<p>While at the University of Connecticut he was elected President of his class for three years and President of the Student body. At the end of his freshman year he was the selected by the President of the University, Dr. Homer Babbidge, for a summer scholarship as a special assistant to United States Congressman Emilio Daddario (D-CT). After his first summer working for the Congressman, Daddario invited him to join his permanent staff. During college, he worked in the Congressmanâ€™s district office and summersâ€™ in his Washington office. After law school he worked in the Congressmanâ€™s Washington office. During that service in Washington he took a central role in two successful congressional campaigns for Daddario. </p>\n\n<p>In 1972 he became Chief of Staff to US Congressman Peter Peyser (R-NY). He served in that job for four years during which time he worked on a number of special projects for then U.S. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.</p>\n\n<p>His work in Washington as a congressional staff member, afforded him the opportunity to meet many interesting people, and be present during the end of the Vietnam War and through the Watergate period. He worked for a Democratic Congressman during the Vietnam War and a Republican Congressman during Watergate. </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Greif left Washington in 1976 to be President of a family retail business in Kansas City. While in Kansas City in addition to a very active involvement in civic activities (see addendum) he got involved in Real Estate investment and Development. Mr. Greif subsequently developed 500 apartment units, 1 million square feet of industrial property, and bought operated, renovated and profitably sold three commercial hotels. </p>\n\n<p>In 1998 Mr. Greif organized a collection company, Cannon Financial Company to purchase credit card and other previously charged off debt by financial institutions. That company merged with a public company, Advanced Financial Company to become itâ€™s main operating division. After consulting with the company for two years, Mr. Greif then organized a commercial leasing company, Heritage Financial, that provided about $30 million annually in financing for asset based commercial equipment clients. </p>\n\n<p>In 2002, Greif joined with other investors to help put together a public company structure that after a trip to China was subsequently sold to a group of Chinese investors who were in the coal mining business in China.
