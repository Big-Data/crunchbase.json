I&#8217;m currently the Founder and CEO of Crashworks, a location-based attraction discovery app being incubated out of Idealab.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Crash, I held executive level positions at ThisNext, Razorgator, and Ticketmaster where I led the Design, HTML, Content, Marketing, and Product Management teams at TN and RG, and Design, HTML, and Content at TM. In addition to my role at Ticketmaster corporate, I founded and ran the company&#8217;s creative agency, Cottonblend, whose clients included AMEX, TicketWeb, Herbie Hancock, Sony Centre, Shows in Branson, and The Troubadour.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, I took Cottonblend independent and built an entirely new design and development studio from the ground up. As a creative agency, the award-winning Cottonblend worked with clients like The Hollywood Reporter, Business.com, DexKnows, and Crowdrise. The fledgling design studio also founded Cuteness Pet Community (http://www.cuteness.com), Crash Los Angeles (http://www.crashla.com), and The Pixel Awards (http://www.pixelawards.com).</p>\n\n<p>I currently live in Venice, California with my wife, Lisa, and our identical twin daughters, Ella Moon and Hadley Star.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6303/16303v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/6303/16303v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/6303/16303v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Crashworks, Inc","permalink":"crash-los-angeles","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9585/169585v4-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/9585/169585v4-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/9585/169585v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder | CEO","firm":{"name":"Cuteness Pet Community","permalink":"cuteness-pet-community","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/8388/38388v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0003/8388/38388v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,166],"assets/images/resized/0003/8388/38388v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"The Pixel Awards","permalink":"the-pixel-awards","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3638/103638v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[168,168],"assets/images/resized/0010/3638/103638v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[168,168],"assets/images/resized/0010/3638/103638v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"Driftr","permalink":"driftr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/7283/17283v1-max-150x150.png"],[[226,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/7283/17283v1-max-250x250.png"],[[226,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/7283/17283v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Product & Creative","firm":{"name":"RazorGator","permalink":"razorgator","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/3172/3172v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,101],"assets/images/resized/0000/3172/3172v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,122],"assets/images/resized/0000/3172/3172v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Product & Creative","firm":{"name":"ThisNext","permalink":"thisnext","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0000/0412/412v1-max-150x150.png"],[[152,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0412/412v1-max-250x250.png"],[[152,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0412/412v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.cottonblend.com/","title":"Cottonblend"},{"external_url":"http://www.cuteness.com","title":"Cuteness Pet Community"},{"external_url":"http://www.pixelawards.com/","title":"The Pixel Awards"}]}
