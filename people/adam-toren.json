Kidpreneurs was born â€“ a book that stokes a childâ€™s desire to get involved in business early by fueling their curiosity in simple, engaging, creative, and safe ways.</p>\n\n<p>The philosophy behind the book is simple. The future of our children begins with us! Most people say, â€œItâ€™s never too late.â€ The Torens say, â€œItâ€™s never too early.â€ The benefits for an early introduction to the basic principles and infinite rewards of entrepreneurship are massive. The Torens have managed to break down otherwise difficult concepts in to fun to read bites that any bright minded child can easily enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>All children share the inalienable right to become financially independent, whether rich or poor, city or suburb. Sharpening a childâ€™s entrepreneurial skills will equip them with the skills necessary to tackle a limitless future. There is no reason it cannot start at an earlier age. Kidpreneurs puts the power in the hands of the future.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/5122/85122v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/5122/85122v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/5122/85122v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"iSell.com","permalink":"isell-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0021/1221/211221v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0021/1221/211221v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,123],"assets/images/resized/0021/1221/211221v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"YoungEntrepreneur.com","permalink":"youngentrepreneur-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0008/5032/85032v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0008/5032/85032v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,141],"assets/images/resized/0008/5032/85032v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Author","firm":{"name":"Kidpreneurs","permalink":"kidpreneurs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/5033/85033v2-max-150x150.png"],[[176,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/5033/85033v2-max-250x250.png"],[[208,295],"assets/images/resized/0008/5033/85033v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"BackupElf.com","permalink":"backupelf-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/4134/104134v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0010/4134/104134v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,219],"assets/images/resized/0010/4134/104134v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bizguy","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/adamtoren","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://bx.businessweek.com/profile/adam-toren/atoren469/","title":"Business Week"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/thebizguy","title":"thebizguy"}]}
