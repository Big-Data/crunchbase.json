He sets his sights on our overall success and on our bottom line. His stewardship successfully led Fluid from dot com dominance through the economic collapse of 2001 to a second generation of online design and development success. We followed him into the fire and came out with a strong new focus. Innovating online retail. Our sweet spot. Our strength.\nAs one of our four founders, Tamir led the merger between Entasis Design + Development and Fluid Technologies to form Fluid, Inc. In addition to his former role as CEO, Tamir led interactive media services, finance and operations at Fluid. Tamir has played essential roles on projects for clients such as GTE, Pacific Bell, Sun Microsystems and Wells Fargo. Before Entasis and Fluid, Tamir was integral to product development at Macromedia. He began his operational career managing the desktop computing facility at UC Berkeley&#8217;s Haas School of Business.\nWhen not behind a keyboard, Tamir is most happy hauling camera gear through the wilderness chasing the Alpenglow. Knowing his leadership style, he&#8217;s likely to catch it. Tamir holds a BA in Architecture from the University of California at Berkeley.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Architecture","institution":"University of California at Berkeley","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","firm":{"name":"Fluid","permalink":"fluid","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0004/1376/41376v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[219,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/1376/41376v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[219,37],"assets/images/resized/0004/1376/41376v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
