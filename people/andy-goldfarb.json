Today at Globespan, he enjoys &#8220;helping to make the imagined, possible.&#8221; He does so by building productive relationships with the firm&#8217;s entrepreneurs, &#8220;by being a good listener, providing space and not interfering.&#8221; Andy also knows that working as a team, going slower to go faster, is critical to reach the important, value-building milestones for a company. </p>\n\n<p>Andy earned an AB degree in East Asian Studies and Economics, magna cum laude, from Harvard College and an MBA, with distinction, from Harvard Business School.
