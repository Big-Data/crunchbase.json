Prior to joining Skybox Imaging, he worked for 4 years pushing the state-of-the-art in rocket propulsion technology at three trailblazing &#8220;New Space&#8221; companies - SpaceX, Blue Origin and Space Propulsion Group.   </p>\n\n<p>Jonny has both a Master of Science and Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University where his wide-ranging interests led him to study a diverse set of subjects including thermodynamics and energy, embedded electronics and software, fluid dynamics, solid state and quantum physics, and mechanics of materials among other things.  He has authored or co-authored 8 papers on rocket propulsion, thermodynamics, and the NASA Ames Peregrine Project.  As a graduate student, Jonny was a teaching assistant in Stanford&#8217;s world-renowned Product Realization Laboratory where he taught hands-on fundamentals of product manufacturing and design.  He is as comfortable behind the controls of a mill or lathe as he is solving partial differential equations in Matlab.  </p>\n\n<p>Jonny also competed as a pitcher for 3 years with the Stanford University Varsity baseball team, during which time he had the privilege of pitching in the 2003 national championship game against Rice Owls.  He continues to play baseball in his free time and loves other outdoor activities such as backpacking, biking and skiing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/4476/184476v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0018/4476/184476v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0018/4476/184476v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jonny Dyer</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Mechanical Engineering","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Science","subject":"Mechanical Engineering","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Engineer","firm":{"name":"Skybox Imaging","permalink":"skybox-imaging","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0012/2677/122677v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,222],"assets/images/resized/0012/2677/122677v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,400],"assets/images/resized/0012/2677/122677v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
