(And the food is unbelievably delicious.)</p>\n\n<p>David launched his first brand &#8211; a technology news site &#8211; in high school, circa 1999, and generated hundreds of dollars in ad revenue, which was a lot for a teenager.</p>\n\n<p>The second company David launched, the web publishing outfit Jossip Initiatives, was born in his Syracuse University dorm room and was profitable from Day One, which is easy when there&#8217;s just one employee and almost no overhead. But Jossip would grow into four premiere blog brands with a full staff based in Manhattan and LA, covering everything from media (Jossip), celebrity (Mollygood), black interest (Stereohyped), and gay and lesbian news and entertainment (Queerty), and would go on to generate seven-figure revenues and reach more than 5 million unique visitors each month. (It also got him on CNN, E!, MSNBC, Fox News, and profiled by New York magazine and Playboy, which his father enjoyed.)</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, David sold the last of his blogs, Queerty, and facilitated the sale of his partner&#8217;s insanely addictive celebrity and pop culture site Pink Is The New Blog.</p>\n\n<p>David lives in Los Angeles. He wants a puppy.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0019/4522/194522v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0019/4522/194522v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,210],"assets/images/resized/0019/4522/194522v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Magazine, African-American Studies","institution":"Syracuse University","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CCO, Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Pop-Up Pantry","permalink":"pop-up-pantry","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0019/3314/193314v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,161],"assets/images/resized/0019/3314/193314v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[334,216],"assets/images/resized/0019/3314/193314v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidhauslaib","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
