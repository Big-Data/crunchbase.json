To this task he brought a varied background in business, law and banking. At Chrysalis, David has worked with some of the most exciting growth companies in the Midwest and South, including Six Flags (formerly Premier Parks of Oklahoma City), Tritel (merged with Telecorp and sold to AT&amp;T Wireless), Regent Communications (sold to Jacor Communications which was sold to Clear Channel Communications), ActaMed (merged with Healtheon and then with WebMD), and High Speed Access Corp (IPO and later sold to Charter Communications). He currently focuses primarily on healthcare investing and chairs the management company and funds&#8217; investment committees.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2005, David was appointed non-executive Chairman of Humana, Inc. (NYSE: HUM). He has served on Humana&#8217;s Board of Directors since 1993, and was non-executive Vice Chairman from 1996 to April 2005. Prior to Chrysalis, David&#8217;s law practice included both domestic and international work, the latter with the U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser&#8217;s (general counsel&#8217;s) office in Washington (1988-1992). Before law school, he worked as a commercial banker for Bank of Boston in Hong Kong, New York, and Boston. David left the bank to manage the import division of a regional hardware wholesaler.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6485/46485v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,229],"assets/images/resized/0004/6485/46485v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[175,229],"assets/images/resized/0004/6485/46485v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"","institution":"Yale University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman and Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Chrysalis Ventures","permalink":"chrysalis-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/3397/23397v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[176,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/3397/23397v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[176,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/3397/23397v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
