Perk Mobile&#8217;s first product was building a location based game engine that ultimately lead to the development of <a href=\"http://www.mobiledead.com\" title=\"Mobile Dead\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mobile Dead</a>. In early 2010 Peter and his co-founder joined foursquare full time to manage BlackBerry and Android development.</p>\n\n<p>Perk Mobile has since moved to offering mobile consulting and development services specific for established web 2.0 and traditional media organizations.</p>\n\n<p>Peter also developed <a href=\"http://www.mogoso.com\" title=\"Mogoso\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mogoso</a>, a mobile web application that aggregates local business and product reviews into a single mobile-friendly search. The idea for Mogoso came from a personal need to compare product information in-store and look up restaurants nearby. Mogoso has been mentioned on CNET, WapReview.com and other mobile news sites.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Perk Mobile, Peter wrote bond modeling software for financial institutions on Wall Street.</p>\n\n<p>Peter has a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Engineering from Syracuse University. His first experience with mobile development was developing SwitchMe with fellow engineers for his capstone project while completing his undergraduate degree at Syracuse. SwitchMe was a Symbian OS application that changed a phone&#8217;s ring tone setting (e.g. from ring to vibrate) based on a user&#8217;s location. SwitchMe was working prototype that resulted in recognition from the local chapter of IEEE in Syracuse and the Louis N. DeMartini Award for Innovative Undergraduate Research from Syracuse University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[69,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/0400/20400v2-max-150x150.png"],[[69,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/0400/20400v2-max-250x250.png"],[[69,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/0400/20400v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://mobiledead.com/\" title=\"Mobile Dead\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mobile Dead</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Mobile Dead","permalink":"mobile-dead","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/0396/20396v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0002/0396/20396v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,99],"assets/images/resized/0002/0396/20396v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Perk Mobile","permalink":"perk-mobile","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"foursquare","permalink":"foursquare","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-250x250.png"],[[442,122],"assets/images/resized/0003/8526/38526v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
