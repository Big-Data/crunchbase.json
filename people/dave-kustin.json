During the dotcom run, Dave held the position of product manager for an online provider of education distributed via major universities. These products were engaging both visually and in content, winning industry awards. After spending nearly 10 years in media, including launching a successful post-production studio, Dave learned that the product or service with the best story wins. That philosophy drove Dave in his pursuit to deliver the most effective marketing solutions for his clients while running a well-known South Florida marketing agency. His ideas won awards, but more importantly they won customers for his clients. In addition to being a culinary school graduate, Dave holds a bachelors degree in Communications from Florida International University and an MBA from the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business at Nova Southeastern University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[53,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8820/18820v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[53,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8820/18820v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[53,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8820/18820v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.wrapmail.com/\" title=\"wrapmail\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrapmail</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","firm":{"name":"WrapMail","permalink":"wrapmail","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/8736/18736v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/8736/18736v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,102],"assets/images/resized/0001/8736/18736v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
