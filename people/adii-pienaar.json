Along with being a serial entrepreneur, he is also a designer &amp; developer (CSS, PHP &amp; WordPress), which has spawned his other company â€“ a boutique design &amp; development agency â€“ Radiiate.</p>\n\n<p>At the young age of 25, Adii has revolutionized both his business and personal life. Back in 2007 somewhere, he decided to call himself a â€œrockstarâ€; so the rockstar-tag is very much a result of some subjective marketing on his sideâ€¦ Generally though heâ€™s just Adii to all those who know him and itâ€™s only online where the Adii Rockstar brand seems larger than life itself.**</p>\n\n<p>Adii designs because he loves the creative freedom it affords him, whilst development appeals to his more logical side. But itâ€™s for business that heâ€™s got a real passion for and itâ€™s within that space, where he is trying to â€œdesignâ€ &amp; craft his own future.</p>\n\n<p>Due to Adiiâ€™s largely unique approach to both life &amp; business, he is also currently authoring a book titled â€œRockstar Businessâ€ which will be available in the second part of 2009. The book will be focussing on how to do business and how to revolutionize oneâ€™s personal life, as a Rockstar. Whilst the â€œrockstarâ€-tag is purely branding, the book will attempt to explain &amp; democratize the concept as a more general one.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0007/3291/73291v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0007/3291/73291v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0007/3291/73291v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"WooThemes","permalink":"woothemes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0005/3629/53629v1-max-150x150.png"],[[190,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/3629/53629v1-max-250x250.png"],[[190,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/3629/53629v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-17-awesome-investors-in-our-400000-seed-round-and-how-we-met-them","source_description":"Buffer Raises $400K To Help Schedule Your Twitter Blasts","raised_amount":400000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":20,"company":{"name":"Buffer","permalink":"buffer","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0012/3972/123972v2-max-150x150.png"],[[228,45],"assets/images/resized/0012/3972/123972v2-max-250x250.png"],[[228,45],"assets/images/resized/0012/3972/123972v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
