I co-founded i-ask with the purpose to change the way people and companies give and get feedback on a daily basis. When I&#8217;m not working on i-ask, I&#8217;ve been working with my co-founder developing mobile apps, and working on a new crowdfunding platform for gamers. I enjoy working in the mobile space and plan to develop additional platforms and games in the future. </p>\n\n<p>In my last role, I spent several years managing a multi-million dollar medical device distribution in New England. I worked with orthopedic and sports medicine surgeons, throughout New England, and took a territory in VT to consecutive growth year over year. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to medical devices I managed several physical therapy practices located in Burlington VT. All of these experiences have prepared me for the current task ahead, developing a startup and disrupting the survey world while taking feedback to the mobile platform.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A","subject":"Sports Medicine","institution":"Lyndon State Collegr","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.i-ask.co","title":"i-ask"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/stevenmfoley","title":"twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/steven-foley/57/320/924","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
