Also, he has argued against the use of formatting objects on the web.</p>\n\n<p>Wium Lie has also promoted the concept of printing from the web. His book on CSS, co-authored with Bert Bos, was produced from HTML and CSS files. These files were then converted to PDF by the Prince XML formatter.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5616/105616v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/5616/105616v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/5616/105616v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Opera Software","permalink":"opera-software","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/3433/13433v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0001/3433/13433v4-max-250x250.png"],[[300,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/3433/13433v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
