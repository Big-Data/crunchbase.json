Or standing on a footpatch touching the glass to interact with a projected menu or display. The impact of a holographic model or dancers entertaining in a store after hours will become the talk of the town. Meeting rooms that do not need to be darkened due to highly efficient reflective screens will keep every one alert and attentive. During October 2007 Kevin introduced the world&#8217;s first 22&#8221; 3D sterescopic monitor for the gaming market in partnership with IP owners iZ3D LLC of San Diego into the NZ market.</p>\n\n<p>He recently developed an immersive F1 styled open cockpit race car that is also a full featured simulator and a petroled powered race car - the premise being that no longer do you need to prented yopu are in a race car when in a virtual world. The vehicle replicates all the vibration from the road and engine delivering real time sensations to the driver. Typically when the driver gets out of the car after a few laps of racing they are a complete buzz with the visual sensation and life like experience on 2m and larger screens.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin is now considering opportunities abroad where the high speed virtual world can be installed.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/5854/35854v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/5854/35854v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/5854/35854v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"ICE AV Technology","permalink":"ice-av-technology-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0012/2193/122193v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[221,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/2193/122193v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[221,125],"assets/images/resized/0012/2193/122193v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/home-theatre/news/article.cfm?c_id=226&objectid=10350691","title":"A new era in home movies"},{"external_url":"http://www.bodyartawards.co.nz/Media/ICE-Digital-Daytime-to-enhance-the-NZ-Bodyart-Award-Events.html","title":"NZ Body Art Awards"},{"external_url":"http://www.robot-hosting.com/html/singapore.html","title":"Intelligent Robot Screens"},{"external_url":"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pc-games/news/article.cfm?c_id=160&objectid=10467613","title":"3D Sterescopic screens"},{"external_url":"http://www.businesstobusiness.co.nz/cms/news/2008/03/art10003104.php","title":"Formula One Simulation"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.kevinandreasend.com","title":"Professional Profile"},{"external_url":"http://www.iceav.co.nz","title":"Audio Visual Technologies"},{"external_url":"http://www.simdeck.com","title":"Formula One Simulators"},{"external_url":"http://www.businesstobusiness.co.nz/cms/news/2008/03/art10003104.php","title":"Building F1 Simulators"}]}
