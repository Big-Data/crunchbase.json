Three of us undertook our MBA project in conjunction with the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship, called &#8216;Making Strategy for Entrepreneurs: How high growth technology companies access and configure resources&#8217; (catchy, I know!)</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental approach of Making Strategy employs a powerful visual mapping process to build up a picture of strategic issues and their resultant goals and links them to a distinct configuration of competencies, assets and resources.</p>\n\n<p>Technology companies proved particularly receptive to this approach as it was visually powerful and logically structured. To date, we have assisted over 20 companies in developing new strategies on this model.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting Fact: the name &#8220;Eriskay Associates&#8221; was taken from our MBA group - each year, the part time intake is named after a Scottish island whose initial letter progresses by one letter per year (ie our predecessor was Coll (no Scottish Islands begin with D) and our successor was Foula (Part of the Shetland Islands).</p>\n\n<p>Eriskay Associates has now been running for five years, during which time we have broadened our activities to include operational and people development and has completed nearly 50 projects of varying scale.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of technology projects, I have recently completed a research exercise for an innovative new form of floating home, and have also secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership for a telephone based market research company in Glasgow.</p>\n\n<p>I contribute to a number of forums, including on Linked in and always interested in talking about strategy, technology and business growth.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Management and Strategy","institution":"University of Strathclyde","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MSc","subject":"Entrepreneurship","institution":"University of Stirling","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Postgraduate Diploma","subject":"Management, Economics and Politics","institution":"University of St Andrew's","graduated_year":1990,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Founded Eriskay Associates","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"Founded Eriskay Associates","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Taylor","permalink":"mark-taylor-7"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/EriskayMark","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Eriskay-Associates-Limited/296838440380595","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/marktaylorglasgow","title":"Linked In"}]}
