While finishing a bachelor program in computer science, a master program in Information Management and a master program in Strategic Management, he started his first and his second business. In the years in which he studied, his interest for being an entrepreneur started growing more and more.</p>\n\n<p>Together with Bas van Steen, Emile is now focusing on his third business: Malvee. With Malvee, Bas and Emile are trying to get so called secondary processes out of businesses: processes that are not the main core of the business. One of these, and also the first they&#8217;re focusing on right now, is measuring employee satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>Besides running these businesses, which indeeds takes some time, Emile likes sporting and traveling. Trips are composed on a regular base out of a mix of city trips (recently Budapest, Oslo, Dubai and Barcelona) and some more extensive trips (recently Thailand and Russia). Sporting can be translated in general to running (quite recently some 10 km, 10 mile and 15 km runs and at the moment in training for a marathon).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/1893/181893v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/1893/181893v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/1893/181893v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Emile Bons</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master of Science","subject":"Information Management","institution":"Tilburg University","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Science","subject":"Strategic Management","institution":"Tilburg University","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Fontys University of Applied Sciences","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-owner","firm":{"name":"Malvee","permalink":"malvee","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.malvee.com","title":"Malvee"}],"web_presences":[]}
