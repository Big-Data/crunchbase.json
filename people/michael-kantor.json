I remember leaving my cushy job and having my co-workers ask, as if it was pure insanity, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to sell advertising on computers?&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>Since making that leap I&#8217;ve worked for, and helped found, a number of companies including: early search pioneer The McKinley Group, dotcom 1.0 star InfoSpace, eLinkNow, dotcom 2.0 almost star Orgoo, and a few others in between. I&#8217;ve learned a number of lessons from the successes and perhaps even more from the failures, and I&#8217;m looking forward to more of both in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Between startups I managed to take more than a year off to travel the world. This experience was invaluable for a number of reasons, but one of the lessons that surprised me was how much I missed the pleasure and satisfaction of a good days work. BTW, if anybody wants to discuss world travel shoot me an email. It&#8217;s a topic I can ramble on about for days.
