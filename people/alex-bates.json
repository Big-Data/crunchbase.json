In June of 2000 he jumped into the private sector, working on big data analytics at a company called Teradata, which developed shared-nothing parallel data warehouses (a precursor of today&#8217;s MapReduce).  In 2006 Alex co-founded Mtelligence to tackle a big data problem for manufacturing, where companies were trying to make sense of an explosion of real-time sensor data.  The Mtelligence predictive equipment health monitoring platform has been deployed at Fortune 100 energy, pharma, and mining companies.  He is lead inventor on several pending patents in the area of machine learning and sensor networks.  Alex received a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oregon&#8217;s Clark Honors College, with a concentration in neuroscience.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/6280/206280v4-max-150x150.png"],[[214,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/6280/206280v4-max-250x250.png"],[[300,350],"assets/images/resized/0020/6280/206280v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Alex Bates</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"Mathematics","institution":"University of Oregon Clark Honors College","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Computer & Information Science","institution":"University of Oregon Clark Honors College","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Mtelligence","permalink":"mtelligence","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0020/6599/206599v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0020/6599/206599v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,316],"assets/images/resized/0020/6599/206599v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.Mtelligence.net","title":""}]}
