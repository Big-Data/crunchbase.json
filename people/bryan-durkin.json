SIF Technology had a great product that needed some development and work before commercializing and Bryan immediately saw the potential.  He started working with furniture designers and manufactures to use this process.  Since the economy was in the &#8220;tank&#8221; he looked for other products that could use smaller amounts of leather and see how he could proceed.</p>\n\n<p>After months of research and market development, Bryan decided that the &#8220;Power Button&#8221; market was the area to focus on.  He presented a Business Plan and was awarded an exclusive to develop and market to this market.  Since Spring of 2010 he has been working full-time on this endeavor since and has made great strides on bringing the product to market.</p>\n\n<p>As the full time evangelist and everything including the kitchen sink, Bryan has assembled a  team of highly respected people from the design world, manufacturing, sales, and experts in the Mobility and Computer Manufacturing channels.</p>\n\n<p>2011 is the year!</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"Economics","institution":"Rutgers University","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Keru Leather","permalink":"keru-leather","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/bryandurkin","title":"Twitter personal"},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/bryandurkin","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
