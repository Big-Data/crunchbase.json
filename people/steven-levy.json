Previously, he was chief technology writer and a senior editor for Newsweek. Levy has had articles published in Harper&#8217;s, Macworld, The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Premiere, and Rolling Stone. He is regarded (along with Walter Mossberg) as a prominent and respected critic of Apple Inc.. In July 2004, Levy wrote a cover story (which also featured an interview with Apple CEO Steve Jobs) which unveiled the 4th generation of the iPod to the world before Apple had officially done so, an unusual event since Apple is well known for its tight-lipped press policy.\nLevy has won several awards, including the &#8220;Computer Press Association Award&#8221; for a report he co-wrote in 1998 on the Year 2000 problem.\nIn 1978, Steven Levy rediscovered Albert Einstein&#8217;s brain in the office of the pathologist who removed and preserved it. \nIn 1984, he wrote a book called Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, in which he described a â€œhacker ethicâ€, which became a guideline to understanding how computers have advanced into the machines that we know and use today. He identified this Hacker Ethic to consist of key points such as that all information is free, and that this information should be used to â€œchange life for the betterâ€.\nLevy received his bachelor&#8217;s degree from Temple University and earned a Master&#8217;s degree in literature from Pennsylvania State University. He lives in New York City with his wife, Pulitzer Prize winner Teresa Carpenter, and son.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/9534/129534v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[199,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/9534/129534v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,301],"assets/images/resized/0012/9534/129534v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Writer","firm":{"name":"Wired Magazine","permalink":"wired-magazine","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/2955/22955v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/2955/22955v1-max-250x250.png"],[[388,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/2955/22955v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
