At 14, his family was the only one in the neighborhood with a compost pile, a 3-acre &#8220;garden&#8221; and a refurbished pre-war Cushman electric car. Later at the University of Michigan, he was captain of the national champion UofM solar car team (the car is now on permanent display at the Chicago Museum of Science &amp; Industry). After graduation, he was a key part of the team that designed and built REVA, the largest selling plug-in passenger electric vehicle in the world. Furqan is an entrepreneur who founded numerous successful technology businesses, including Pivot, Inc. a revolutionary instant messaging collaboration platform for Wall Street traders. He is a graduate of Harvard Business School, founder of ObamaCycle and our resident rocket scientist (or as close as we get â€“ he has a degree in aerospace engineering).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/7861/87861v2-max-150x150.png"],[[206,206],"assets/images/resized/0008/7861/87861v2-max-250x250.png"],[[206,206],"assets/images/resized/0008/7861/87861v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Wikicommons</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSE","subject":"Aerospace Engineering","institution":"University of Michigan","graduated_year":1994,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Business","institution":"Harvard University","graduated_year":1999,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","firm":{"name":"Viridus","permalink":"viridus","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/8865/18865v1-max-150x150.png"],[[128,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/8865/18865v1-max-250x250.png"],[[128,100],"assets/images/resized/0001/8865/18865v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"extensionEngine","permalink":"extension-engine","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8017/68017v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0006/8017/68017v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/8017/68017v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder / President / CEO","firm":{"name":"Pivot","permalink":"pivot","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/0098/20098v2-max-150x150.png"],[[80,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/0098/20098v2-max-250x250.png"],[[80,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/0098/20098v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
