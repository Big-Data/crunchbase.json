Well known throughout the wireless industryâ€™s inner circle, when Beezagâ€™s Chief Operating Officer isnâ€™t accepting speaker requests for trade events, he can be found serving on the advisory boards for several early-stage mobile, Internet and e-commerce companies. He is also a member of the leadership board of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) Wireless Internet Caucus; for him, attending CTIA shows are annual pilgrimages.</p>\n\n<p>Just about the Web-savviest bridge-and-tunnel man around, you may see him on the PATH train toggling on his BlackBerry. Or his iTouch. Or his HTC Touch. He is a Machead and has a fondness for his first-generation Kindle. His wife is a rocket scientist (no joke), and his New Jersey home sports 15 different IP addresses. Steven is such a natural fit for the Beezag team that when his three kids get grounded, they are allowed to do anything but Beezag. This diehard Rangers fan even Beezags from his seat â€” Section 308, Row 3 â€” at Madison Square Garden (fact check: only during intermissions).</p>\n\n<p>Prior to making sure Beezag users get paid when they want to, Steven was the Chief Executive Officer of Upoc Networks, a leading wireless messaging company. He was also a board member of Dada Entertainment, a joint venture of Dada USA and Sony BMG. When Dada acquired Upoc in August 2006, he successfully integrated the business, operations and technology sides of Upoc into Dada S.P.A.</p>\n\n<p>Steven spent his pre-CEO days at Upoc as its Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President. This capacity included directing QA and customer service, solidifying his commitment to the end-user experience.</p>\n\n<p>As Executive Vice President for Wireless Systems at Pinnacor, Steven grew the firm from a start-up to a significant supplier of content and wireless application services to goliaths Verizon, Vodafone, Virgin Mobile, AT&amp;T and others. He also served as Pinnacor&#8217;s CTO.</p>\n\n<p>Stevenâ€™s early career spans 20 years with Bell Laboratories and Lucent Technologies. Products he managed have produced more than $1 billion in revenue. He earned a BSEE from Union College, an MSEE from Cornell University and an MBA from New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business. He has authored four patents.</p>\n\n<p>An engaging writer, his Mobileman blog is read by thousands of industry insiders on a weekly basis.</p>\n\n<p>It only takes eight words to really sum him up: Industry Guru. Blogger. Bleeds Ranger Blue. Captain Beezag.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Masters of Engineering","subject":"","institution":"Cornell","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BSEE","subject":"","institution":"Union College","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"New York University - Stern School of Business","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"COO","firm":{"name":"Beezag","permalink":"beezag","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/4624/74624v1-max-150x150.png"],[[229,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/4624/74624v1-max-250x250.png"],[[229,91],"assets/images/resized/0007/4624/74624v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.stevenspencer.net","title":""},{"external_url":"http://ceospeaks.worpress.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/njspence","title":""}]}
