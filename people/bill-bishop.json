I am bilingual and have experience working in both the US and China. I co-founded CBS MarketWatch in 1997 and stayed until the sale in 2004 to Dow Jones. I was never a journalist, and instead worked in several business roles over the years, the last as head of the MarketWatch consumer Internet business.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently an investor in/advisor to several startups (including Stocktwits) and provide China consulting services while figuring out the next big gig.</p>\n\n<p>I have 6 academic years of formal Chinese language studies, an MA in China Studies from Johns Hopkins SAIS and a BA from Middlebury College. I have lived and worked in China on and off for over 8 years since 1989, and continuously in Beijing since mid-2005. I am often quoted in major media such as Bloomberg, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, New York Times etc.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently I was CEO of Red Mushroom Studios, a Beijing-based developer and operator of online games. It was not successful. I did learn a lot from failure but I prefer to learn from success.</p>\n\n<p>My spouse runs CCSweets, Beijingâ€™s best cake shop, and we have 5.5 year old twin girls.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to writing Digicha, I occasionally write about more general China topics at Sinocism.com and am an active user of Twitter @niubi and Sina Weibo @billbishop.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"East Asian Studies","institution":"Middlebury College","graduated_year":1990,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MA","subject":"International Affairs/China Studies","institution":"Johns Hopkins SAIS","graduated_year":1995,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Red Mushroom","permalink":"red-mushroom","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder, EVP","firm":{"name":"CBS MarketWatch","permalink":"cbs-marketwatch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0011/0146/110146v1-max-150x150.png"],[[240,70],"assets/images/resized/0011/0146/110146v1-max-250x250.png"],[[240,70],"assets/images/resized/0011/0146/110146v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/12/stocktwits-raises-800k","source_description":"StockTwits Raises $800K For Twitter-Fueled Stock Community","raised_amount":800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"StockTwits","permalink":"stocktwits","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/1903/31903v1-max-150x150.png"],[[238,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1903/31903v1-max-250x250.png"],[[238,88],"assets/images/resized/0003/1903/31903v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.danwei.org/people/bill_bishop_talks_marketwatch_investment_and_twitter.php","title":"MarketWatch founder Bill Bishop talks career, money and Twitter "},{"external_url":"http://www.jlmpacificepoch.com/pecontent?id=109711_0_3_0_M","title":"RedMushroom Studios CEO Bill Bishop on BaoBao BengBeng"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/bbishop","title":"Google Reader Share"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/billbishop","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
