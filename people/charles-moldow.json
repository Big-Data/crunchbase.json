Before coming to Foundation Capital, he was part of two teams that successfully built companies from early start-up through greater than $100 million in sales and exits near or above a billion dollars. Charles has made thirteen investments since joining Foundation, of which four have been acquired: PowerSet to Microsoft; Xoopit to Yahoo!; Adwhirl to Google; and, Weblistic to Spot Runner. Charles works closely with his current portfolio, which includes: Everyday Health, National Payment Network, Pixazza, SunRun, Big Deal, HomeRun and LendingClub.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Foundation, Charles spent five years with Tellme Networks and was a member of the founding executive team. While there, he led Tellme in raising one of the largest private financing rounds in the country post-Internet bubble, adding $125 million in cash to the company balance sheet during tough market conditions in August, 2000. Tellme was acquired by Microsoft in 2007 for $760 million.  </p>\n\n<p>Prior to Tellme, Charles was a member of the founding team of Internet access provider @Home Network. In 1996, he established the @Media division; and over the ensuing three years helped establish @Media as the leading broadband media provider. In 1997 the company went public. A year later, Charles assisted in the $7 billion acquisition of Excite Network. After the merger, he became General Manager of Matchlogic, the $80 million division focused on interactive advertising.</p>\n\n<p>Charles&#8217; entrepreneurial penchant dates back to 1989 when he co-founded OnTime Guideâ€”which replaced the OAG Pocket Flight Guide as the must-have resource for frequent business travelersâ€”and PrimeTime Partners, which attempted to establish a new category of self liquidating promotions on behalf of advertisers and direct marketers. Prior to that, Charles spent three years in the Mergers and Acquisitions practice at Merrill Lynch.</p>\n\n<p>Charles holds a BS degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and received his MBA from Harvard University. He lives in the Bay Area with his wife and four children.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/7852/47852v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,220],"assets/images/resized/0004/7852/47852v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,220],"assets/images/resized/0004/7852/47852v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Harvard University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BS Econ","subject":"Wharton ","institution":"University of Pennsylvania","graduated_year":1987,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Observer","firm":{"name":"Sunrun","permalink":"sunrun","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0004/6412/46412v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,111],"assets/images/resized/0004/6412/46412v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,201],"assets/images/resized/0004/6412/46412v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"HomeRun","permalink":"homerun","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/6997/86997v1-max-150x150.png"],[[248,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/6997/86997v1-max-250x250.png"],[[248,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/6997/86997v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Observer","firm":{"name":"Lending Club","permalink":"lendingclub","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0000/4531/4531v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/4531/4531v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[307,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/4531/4531v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"BigDeal","permalink":"bigdeal","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6866/66866v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0006/6866/66866v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[277,79],"assets/images/resized/0006/6866/66866v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"National Payment Network","permalink":"national-payment-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0007/6999/76999v2-max-150x150.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0007/6999/76999v2-max-250x250.png"],[[215,88],"assets/images/resized/0007/6999/76999v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"CloudOn","permalink":"apptou","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/7811/107811v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/7811/107811v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/7811/107811v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/11/swipely/","source_description":"","raised_amount":7500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Swipely","permalink":"swipely","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0006/6445/66445v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0006/6445/66445v1-max-250x250.png"],[[291,83],"assets/images/resized/0006/6445/66445v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"NOWBOX","permalink":"nowmov","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0008/6412/86412v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0008/6412/86412v3-max-250x250.png"],[[327,78],"assets/images/resized/0008/6412/86412v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2010/10/27/apptou-gets-1-8m-for-mobile-application-startup/","source_description":"AppToU gets $1.8M for mobile application startup","raised_amount":1800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":10,"funded_day":27,"company":{"name":"CloudOn","permalink":"apptou","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/7811/107811v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/7811/107811v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/7811/107811v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
