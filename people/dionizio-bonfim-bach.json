A little later he started professionally playing in parties and other events around the city. Since then, there are 15 years of history and sound.</p>\n\n<p>Music changed, and Djio got along. Meanwhile he played several genres: Techno, Trance, Progressive House&#8230; Time passed and, as usual, good things last. The good and old House wins new clothing (Electro, Filtered, Disco, Funky, &#8230;) and is still his main work genre. Always searching for a fusion between the classics and news tendencies, researches ethnic rhythms, preferring brazilian, afro and latin sounds.
