He came from the position as Managing Director of Laerdal Medical, the fast growing global leader in emergency medical equipment. Before Laerdal Medical, Arve headed significant business development projects at Nestlï¿½ SA in Poland and Scandinavia, following five years tenure as management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Co. He holds a M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and a MBA from Columbia University (1988).</p>\n\n<p>A native of Norway, and a former junior national team skier, Arve likes to stay close to the sea and not far away from the snow. Outside of business hours you will not be surprised to find him pursuing activities related to these elements. He also spends significant time with his wife and 2 daughters. However his long standing passion with vintage models from a well known sportscar maker in Stuttgart, Germany, make it almost equally likely that you&#8217;ll find him in the garage, with an oily socket wrench in his hand, and a big smile on his face.</p>\n\n<p>Arve serves as Director of Enigma, Interse and Speakanet, and is also a Director of the listed company Luxo ASA.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9647/29647v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/9647/29647v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[219,329],"assets/images/resized/0002/9647/29647v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
