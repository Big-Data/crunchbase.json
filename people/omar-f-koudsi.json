In 2003, Jeeran started showing a lot of promise; Omar decided to work on it full time believing in the potential even though it had yet to start making revenue at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Several years and two VC rounds later, latest investment being from Intel Capital, Jeeran in its latest iteration is the largest reviews site in the MENA region.  Jeeran is a review centric site that connects people with places in their city.  Jeeran is currently a team of 60+ people spread among three eight cities.</p>\n\n<p>Omar currently spends most of his time leading the growth of Jeeran by filling in many shoes; typical of many entrepreneurs working on their startup.  He is an Endeavor entrepreneur and a Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year nominee.</p>\n\n<p>He also enjoys participating in programs such as Injaz Leadership which teaches university students about leadership and taking initiative. In weekends (some  of them!), he is booked for his wife and two kids.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0016/3116/163116v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0016/3116/163116v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,346],"assets/images/resized/0016/3116/163116v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Creative Commons</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Jeeran","permalink":"jeeran","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0011/6951/116951v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,160],"assets/images/resized/0011/6951/116951v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,160],"assets/images/resized/0011/6951/116951v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/omarfk","title":"Twitter"}]}
