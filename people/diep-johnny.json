It needn&#8217;t be hard and fast, but the options are too vast to approach without a figure or a price range in mind.</li>\n<li>What kind of experience do you want? Domestic or foreign? A city or the countryside? The mountains or the beach?</li>\n<li>What is the focus of the trip? Is it a family trip, where diversions for the children are needed? Is your goal to relax or do you want lots of activity? Do you want to stay put or move around? Would you like to pursue any hobbies?</li>\n<li>When do you want to travel? Plan dates-but with some flexibility. Prices change as a destination moves from its high season to a &#8220;shoulder&#8221; season and then low season.</li>\n<li>What type of tour do you want? Are you interested in the comfort of a fully escorted motor-coach tour or cruise? Would you prefer an all-inclusive package with air, or do you lean toward the greater independence of a modular approach?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Check Further at: http://www.frontiervoyage.com (or) www.ecovietnamtour.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[76,91],"assets/images/resized/0010/2133/102133v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[76,91],"assets/images/resized/0010/2133/102133v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[76,91],"assets/images/resized/0010/2133/102133v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"bachelor","subject":"Tourism","institution":"Hanoi University Of Culture","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Eco-Vietnam Tour","permalink":"eco-vietnam-tour","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager","firm":{"name":"Indochina Frontier Voyage","permalink":"indochina-frontier-voyage","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ecovietnamtour.com","title":"Eco-Vietnam Tour & Travel, Eco-Friendly Travel, Ecotour Vietnam, Green Travel, Responsible Travel Indochina"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.frontiervoyage.com","title":"Indochina Frontier Voyage - Travel Indochina On Any Budget"}]}
