I approach every endeavor as an entrepreneur and each interaction as an opportunity.  From launching my own startups in Manila, to working among LA&#8217;s Hollywood entertainment A-listers and now Silicon Valley tech, I am passionate about the tech/media business and know what it takes to create a story, an experience and a great brand. </p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked internationally in Europe and Asia and most recently was responsible for TechCrunch launch in China producing DISRUPT Beijing in October 2011.  I actively seek opportunities to help early stage tech start-ups grow and thrive around the globe and can&#8217;t wait to see where we head next!  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/8564/98564v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8564/98564v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/8564/98564v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA in Economics & International Relations","subject":"","institution":"Boston University","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Entertainment Studies","institution":"UCLA","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Events Director","firm":{"name":"TechCrunch","permalink":"techcrunch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/0576/10576v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal","firm":{"name":"Vintana Media Group","permalink":"vintana-media-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Digital Media & Management Consultant","firm":{"name":"Organica Music Group","permalink":"organica-music-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/tanyaporquez","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=205096&authType=name&authToken=q-Tj&locale=en_US&pvs=pp&trk=ppro_viewmore","title":"Linkedin"}]}
