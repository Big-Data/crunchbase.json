His deep knowledge of paid and organic search, creative thinking and enthusiasm for everything he does makes him well respected by his peers. He also leads the team of project managers and enterprise search optimisers, and is a regular speaker at search engine marketing events. </p>\n\n<p>With over 12 years experience of new media and emerging technologies, Teddie first got involved with the internet in 1996 while working for MSN during the launch of Internet Explorer 3 â€“ the browser that led to the growth of the internet as a consumer medium. He then moved on to work for BNP-Paribas â€“ one of the biggest investment banks in Europe â€“ and, up until setting up his own business in September 1999, specialised in internet-based technology, the research of growth internet businesses and business models. He had a front row seat for the dotcom boom and then bust, seeing exactly what was working and what was not â€“ and fed these invaluable lessons back into his approach to search engine marketing. His long-standing expertise in this area has helped Guava win major clients like Confused.com and NestlÃ©.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"SEO Director","firm":{"name":"Guava UK","permalink":"guava-uk","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/3682/43682v2-max-150x150.png"],[[235,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/3682/43682v2-max-250x250.png"],[[423,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/3682/43682v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.guava.co.uk/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-optimisation/","title":"Search Engine Optimisation"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.jobsinsearch.com/page/index.asp?pageCatID=21&pageID=132","title":"Jobs in Search Profile"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/ecowell","title":"Teddie on Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/guavauk","title":"GuavaUK Twitter"}]}
