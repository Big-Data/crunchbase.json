He was brought up in a tightly stitched household of an ever present father, a loving mother and a role model brother.  His father taught him the meaning of dedication, his mother the meaning of unconditional love and his brother the meaning of determination. This Trifecta coupled with private and public school molded a street smart, personable, slap-stick humored young man that embodies the voice of reason in every facet of his life.</p>\n\n<p>Educated at Howard University in Washington DC, Rustin ventured out to foreign land after graduating. His location, to this day is unknown but his blogs surface across the internet with current social commentary, gut-busting videos and inspirational motivating run-on blogs.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Rustin is the Operations Manager for the media conglomerate, AlumniRoundup which includes the following entities:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* AlumniRoundup.com - HBCU online magazine\n* RoundupTV - Webisode index of interviews, documentaries and adventures worldwide as it pertains to AlumniRoundup\n* Roundup Radio - Streaming internet radio hosted by AlumniRoundup\n* 18 Social Networks dedicated to serving Alumni of 18 HBCUs\n</code></pre>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/2001/42001v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[165,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/2001/42001v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/2001/42001v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA - Business Management","subject":"","institution":"Howard University","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"AlumniRoundup","permalink":"alumniroundup","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.AlumniRoundup.com","title":"Online HBCU Magazine"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.Twitter.com/RoundupRussy","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.Youtube.com/RoundupRussy","title":"Youtube"},{"external_url":"http://www.RoundupRussy.com","title":"Blog"}]}
