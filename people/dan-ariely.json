His interests include daily behaviors such as buying (or not), saving (or not), ordering food in restaurants, procrastination, dishonesty, and decision making under different emotional states. His experiments are consistently interesting, amusing, and informative, demonstrating the ways we are all predictably irrational.</p>\n\n<p>His book, Predictably Irrational, was selected as one of the notable books for 2008 by the New-York-Times and as the best business book for 2008 by Amazon, Hudson, and BusinessWeek. He was also named as one of the 10 new gurus for 2008 by Fortune Magazine. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/5101/35101v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/5101/35101v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,373],"assets/images/resized/0003/5101/35101v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.dld-conference.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"StylePath","permalink":"stylepath","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0000/1858/1858v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0000/1858/1858v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0000/1858/1858v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"James B Duke Professor of Behavioral Economics","firm":{"name":"Duke University","permalink":"duke-university","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[147,71],"assets/images/resized/0011/2605/112605v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[147,71],"assets/images/resized/0011/2605/112605v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[147,71],"assets/images/resized/0011/2605/112605v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
