Having started and financing three ventures with my own money, I found myself to be a global consumer internet product leader. I have successfully brought to market an advertising network, a social network, an e-commerce store, a telco platform, and microprocessors&#8211;earning several patents now owned or referenced as prior art by over 30 companies: Sony Ericsson, Microsoft, Oracle, Intel, IBM&#8230;I am passionate about leading brilliant teams to unleash commercial value by deploying new algorithms and transformative business models. I am natively strategic, obsessive about achieving: end-user delight, milestones on time/budget, defensible competitive advantage. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[94,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4506/34506v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[157,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/4506/34506v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[283,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/4506/34506v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Pablo Bertorello</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Electrical Engineering","institution":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Interim CEO","firm":{"name":"LIV ","permalink":"liv","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founding CEO","firm":{"name":"CUPR","permalink":"descubrimos","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/3640/23640v1-max-150x150.png"],[[114,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/3640/23640v1-max-250x250.png"],[[114,101],"assets/images/resized/0002/3640/23640v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founding CEO","firm":{"name":"Verosee","permalink":"verosee","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director/GM","firm":{"name":"Telephony@Work, acquired by Oracle","permalink":"telephony-work-acquired-by-oracle","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Program Manager","firm":{"name":"Intel","permalink":"intel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.pablobertorello.com","title":"Pablo Bertorello's Blog"}]}
