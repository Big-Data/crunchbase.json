A famous child actor, Alyssa has continued to work throughout her adulthood in both television and film.</p>\n\n<p>Alyssa has a history of starring in long running successful television series. She most recently starred on the hit WB series â€œCharmedâ€ for nine years. The seriesâ€™ debut was the highest-rated premiere in the networkâ€™s history, and continued to be a great success for Spelling and The WB. The showâ€™s international appeal has brought it to more than 100 territories around the world, spanning Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. She also starred on the Fox cornerstone series â€œMelrose Place.â€ She began her career on ABCâ€™s â€œWhoâ€™s the Bossâ€ which aired for eight years. Milano was most recently seen in a recurring role on the hit NBC comedy, â€œMy Name is Earl.â€</p>\n\n<p>Alyssaâ€™s film credits include â€œHugo Poolâ€ co-starring Sean Penn and Robert Downey Jr., the Imagine/Universal film, â€œFear,â€ and â€œDickie Roberts: Former Child Star.â€ She also provided a lead voice for Disneyâ€™s recent sequel to the animated favorite â€œLady and the Tramp.â€ She was recently seen as the title character in the Lifetime Original movie, â€œWisegal,â€ (which she also produced).</p>\n\n<p>However, her latest role is outside the world of Hollywood, as a philanthropist. Because of all her charitable work on behalf of children, Alyssa was invited by UNICEF in 2003 to become a National Ambassador. Her first trip with the world-renowned organization was to Angola, Africa (May 2004) to see first hand the issues plaguing the newly liberated country. Milano followed that trip with a visit to India in June 2005. She is currently working with UNICEF to educate American youth to the issues crucial to that countryâ€™s evolution. She launched UNICEFâ€™s pivotal â€œTrick or Treatâ€ campaign last fall as an official spokesperson, and has plans to work with UNICEF on numerous projects in the future, with any and all proceeds returning to the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Milano also has her own clothing and jewelry line, TOUCH by Alyssa Milano. Launched in the Spring of 2007, TOUCH was born out of necessity. When Milano, an avid baseball fan, went to games, she wanted to wear fan gear to support her team, but found that the product mix offered in the marketplace did not address her everyday fashion needs. She felt women should be able to look stylish while cheering on their favorite team. So, she partnered with G-III Apparel Group and Major League Baseball to design and distribute a line of juniorsâ€™ ladies MLB apparel. The line is not just for baseball fans anymore. Recently she has joined forces with the NFL, NBA and NHL to make TOUCH available to fans of football, basketball and hockey as well.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/8199/68199v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/8199/68199v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/8199/68199v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Twitter</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Square","permalink":"square","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-150x150.png"],[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-250x250.png"],[[136,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/8147/68147v18-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
