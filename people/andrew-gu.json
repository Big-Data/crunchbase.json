A Phi Beta Kappa class of 2011 Yale graduate with a degree in Computer Science, Andrew was raised in the hills of Seattle, Washington. He has extensive experience at computer keyboards, and has worked both in the corporate world and with a number of start-ups. His love of coding began when he created his first two programs at age 14 with Java. He started with an application to manage his to-do list, then followed up with a functional clone of Tetris (which he was able to play the extra time he freed up thanks to his newly organized schedule). In his spare time, he&#8217;s a fire spinner and juggler. This is his first foray as Chief Technology Officer, and he&#8217;s excited to help build the future of education.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Desmos","permalink":"desmos","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/8490/128490v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0012/8490/128490v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,153],"assets/images/resized/0012/8490/128490v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
