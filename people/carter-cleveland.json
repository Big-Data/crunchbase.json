Art.sy helps you discover art you&#8217;ll love, from works for sale by leading galleries to those on display in museums and private collections. Art.sy created The Art Genome Project, an ongoing study of the characteristics that distinguish and connect works of original art. Developed in collaboration with art world professionals (including curators, artists, academics, and art dealers) and Joe Kennedy (CEO of Pandora and the Music Genome Project), The Art Genome Project and Art.syâ€™s proprietary search technology allow Art.sy to make intelligent artwork recommendations based on your personal preferences. Prior to founding Art.sy, Carter co-created the Faster Filter, a DRTV product that was licensed to Telebrands Co. in 2009. Carter was the 2nd employee for Give Real, a venture-backed startup; a software developer for Citigroup; and researcher at NASA and City College of New York. Carter graduated from Princeton University in 2009 with a BSE in computer science. While at Princeton he played on the Varsity squash team for four years, and performed with the diSiac Dance Company.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/1989/81989v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[205,205],"assets/images/resized/0008/1989/81989v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[205,205],"assets/images/resized/0008/1989/81989v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Ellen Hukkelhoven</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSE","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Princeton University","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Art.sy","permalink":"art-sy","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2612/82612v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2612/82612v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/2612/82612v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/carter.cleveland","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/cartercleveland","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/carterac","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/cacleveland","title":"YouTube"}]}
