Dr. Duffy was previously at Surface Logix, where he was the Director of Pharmacomer Technology. There he oversaw the development of a novel chemical technology for optimizing the PK/PD of small molecules that resulted in two drug candidates currently in Phase II clinical trials. Prior to that, Dr. Duffy was at Gamera Biosciences where he was a co-inventor of a centrifugal microfluidic device called the LabCD that was acquired and commercialized by Tecan. Dr. Duffy is an inventor on 12 U.S. patents and has more than 20 publications in the fields of surface chemistry, microfluidics, and bioanalysis. Dr. Duffy was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University. He was the first Sir Alan Wilson Research Fellow of Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge. Dr. Duffy obtained his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, and his B.A. and M.A. degrees in Natural Sciences from Selwyn College, University of Cambridge.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/0901/220901v1-max-150x150.png"],[[150,174],"assets/images/resized/0022/0901/220901v1-max-250x250.png"],[[150,174],"assets/images/resized/0022/0901/220901v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A. and M.A. ","subject":"Natural Sciences","institution":"Selwyn College","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Research","firm":{"name":"Quanterix","permalink":"quanterix","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0003/2397/32397v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0003/2397/32397v1-max-250x250.png"],[[260,69],"assets/images/resized/0003/2397/32397v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
