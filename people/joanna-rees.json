Within four years, they built a $200 million fund.</p>\n\n<p>Joanna&#8217;s business was based simply on identifying smart entrepreneurs with great ideas and making them happen. Investing in and advising early-stage best-of-breed innovative ideas, VSP helped build more than 60 Bay Area companies, moving innovative concepts from the drawing board, through the research, planning, and financing stages, and establishing dozens of solid, sustainable companies with long-term value. Over fourteen years, VSP weathered the dot.com collapse and helped start firms in a diverse range of industries including technology, retailing, consumer products, wireless networking, cognitive learning software, and financial services for the unbanked. VSP companies have created thousands of jobs across the Bay Area.</p>\n\n<p>via: <a href=\"http://www.joinjoanna.com\" title=\"JoinJoanna.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">JoinJoanna.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Joanna Rees is Chief Fonera of FON USA and president of the US Advisory Board.
