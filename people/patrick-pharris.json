His experience spans sponsorships and media sales, sponsorship activation and management, public relations, sales promotion, and advertising.  </p>\n\n<p>Since 2002 Mr. Pharris has sold sponsorship programs worth more than $100-million. The media relations campaigns he has created and implemented have made more than two billion media impressions for a wide range of clients.</p>\n\n<p>While Mr. Pharris has provided strategic and creative services to more than 500 companies throughout his career, he recognizes â€˜first everâ€™, â€˜technology breakthroughâ€™ and â€˜world record breakingâ€™ campaigns and projects for General Motors, Monster Energy Drink (Hansen Natural Corporation), Sprint/Nextel, Princess Cruises, Harrahâ€™s Entertainment, and Sunrgi Solar Energy, among the most significant.</p>\n\n<p>IN THE BEGINNING\nIn 1983 Pharris joined the ranks of the advertising industry in the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, at the time one of the largest advertising agencies in the world.  His work on the Levi Strauss &amp; Company, Pacific Bell, Dole Pineapple and Alaska Division of Tourism accounts led him to a position as the Vice Chairman of the San Francisco Fishermanâ€™s Wharf Marketing Task Force and general manager of Pier 39â€™s San Francisco Experience. Three years later Pharris answered a call from the Palm Springs Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and accepted an offer to become the director of publicity and promotions for the tourism marketing entity.</p>\n\n<p>THE SPRING BOARD TO NATIONAL MEDIA CONNECTIONS\nShortly after Pharris took the job with the convention and visitors bureau he met celebrity mayor Sonny Bono at a social gathering.  Taking a liking to Pharris, Mayor Bono offered his celebrity to the desert resorts community and positioned Pharris to be a key player in his destination marketing programs.  Through his relationships with Bono and the media Pharris was actively involved in the formation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Palm Springs Celebrity Road Rally, securing the Miss California Pageant and its broadcast rights for the City of Palm Springs, and for dozens of destination marketing initiatives that led to a rapid rebirth of Palm Springs.  It was here that Pharris was tapped to lead protocol for visiting dignitary Gennady Gerasimov, the foreign ministry spokesman of the former Soviet Union, during his â€œPerestroikaâ€ tour to Southern California.  Shortly thereafter, Pharris was asked to join legendary Hollywood public relations firm, Mahoney Wasserman, to help lead the growth of the firmsâ€™ corporate public relations division.  Upon hearing the news of the Mahoney Wasserman recruitment Bono contacted former Sonny and Cher PR man Jim Mahoney and negotiated a bigger salary for Pharris and of course, commission for bringing the Palm Springs public relations account to the agency.</p>\n\n<p>THE ENTREPRENEUR\nA year after leading several accounts for Mahoney Wasserman, including Hilton Hotels Corporation, Pharris brought an idea to Mahoney and his long-time friend and client, Barron Hilton; produce newsworthy footage about the opening of the Hotel Conrad Hong Kong (a Hilton property) and distribute that video footage to television stations throughout the United States and around the world thereby promoting the Hilton brand. Pharrisâ€™ hook:  an on-camera sound bite from Hilton stating â€œâ€¦we want Hilton Hotels to be the conduit to capitalism in the new communist governing of Hong Kong.â€ The monumental success of this campaign spawned Pharrisâ€™ first company, Perri Pharris Productions, which became one of the most successful broadcast public relations agencies in the United States.  During the next five years Pharrisâ€™ company provided services to hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies.  His vision led to an evolution of the company that combined broadcast public relations with web development and Internet PR. The company was renamed Electronic Media Communications and grew exponentially during the following five years.  It was here that Pharris and his team created and launched nearly a thousand campaigns for such well know companies as General Motors, Princess Cruises, the Recording Industry Association of America, The Walt Disney Company, Suzuki, MGM Grand, Harrahâ€™s Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, and many others.  While the Internet was in its relative infancy, Pharris combined multiple technologies to create Internet Press Kit, a unique application of Internet technologies for the e-mail distribution and user-monitoring of multi-media content to the media and special interest groups, which was instantly provided to the agencyâ€™s extensive client base.</p>\n\n<p>GROWING LAS VEGAS\nPharris and his team were recruited to produce dozens of broadcast events for the rapid expansion of Las Vegas in the 1990s, including:  the Grand Opening of the MGM Grand; the Grand Opening of the Stratosphere Hotel, Casino and Tower; the Grand Re-Opening of Harrahâ€™s Las Vegas; Siegfried &amp; Royâ€™s Secret Garden at The Mirage; the Ground Breaking and Grand Opening of Star Trek The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton; the Grand Opening of The Resort at Summerlin; the Consumer Electronics Show; COMDEX; the SEMA trade show, and countless others. </p>\n\n<p>On the heels of this success Pharris was chosen to co-author an investment grade advertising revenue study for the soon-to-be-built Las Vegas Monorail. Upon completion, Pharris was asked by project leaders to present the revenue plan to bond raters, insurers and buyers and serve as  part of the road-show team which ultimately raised $650-million to the develop and operate the monorail.  Pharrisâ€™ plan was put into action where he led all out-of-home advertising and sponsorship sales for the Las Vegas Monorail Company securing contracts worth more than $70-million from General Motors, Sprint/Nextel, Hansenâ€™s Natural (Monster Energy Drink), Sony, Paramount, Bank of Nevada, and others.</p>\n\n<p>PHARRIS MEDIA\nIn 2007 Mr. Pharris founded Pharris Media to provide public relations, marketing communications, and media sales services to a select list of clients.
