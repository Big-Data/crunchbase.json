The company has been profitable every single month since its inception and is actively involved in publishing &amp; marketplaces for Web Professionals.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, Mark spun off 99designs out of SitePoint as its own separate business. 99designs has become the market leader in crowdsourced graphic design and currently sees a new graphic uploaded to the site every 7 seconds and pays out over $1,000,000 to designers every month. In April 2011 99designs received $35m in a Round A led by Accel Partners.</p>\n\n<p>99designs has run crowdsourced design projects for tens of thousands of small business owners, as well as big brands like Adidas, TiVo, Dish Networks, and bestselling authors like Tim Ferriss and Rick Warren (author of â€œThe Purpose Driven Lifeâ€).</p>\n\n<p>In June of 2009, Mark and Matt launched Flippa.com, a marketplace for buying and selling small websites via auction. Flippa currently sells over $2 million worth of website assets per month, with its biggest sale ever being ReTweet.com which sold for $250,000.</p>\n\n<p>In January of 2011, Learnable.com was launched, again as a spin off from SitePoint.  Learnable is a peer to peer education platform where anyone can create an online course and sell access to it online.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0013/4212/134212v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,220],"assets/images/resized/0013/4212/134212v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[352,311],"assets/images/resized/0013/4212/134212v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Flippa","permalink":"flippa","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0006/6727/66727v8-max-150x150.png"],[[197,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/6727/66727v8-max-250x250.png"],[[197,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/6727/66727v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"99designs","permalink":"99designs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/4438/14438v11-max-150x150.png"],[[193,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/4438/14438v11-max-250x250.png"],[[193,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/4438/14438v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"SitePoint","permalink":"sitepoint","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/7885/27885v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/7885/27885v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/7885/27885v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A79e5LMxVAU","title":"Interview with 99designs Co-founder Mark Harbottle"}],"web_presences":[]}
