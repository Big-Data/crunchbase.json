International outsourcing – outsourcing work – is the driving force behind this. </p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I are steadily building a worldwide network of profitable (IT-) companies. We scout the world for precious talent like real explorers. </p>\n\n<p>Many people wonder if hiring IT programmers or designers offshore is a good idea and whether it is suitable for their company. Questions arise: </p>\n\n<p>✔Do the advantages outweigh the costs? \n✔How do I develop my processes? \n✔How do I develop a clear strategy? \n✔Is Eastern Europe a better choice than India or not? \n✔Can we outsource as a smaller company? \n✔How do I manage people from a distance? </p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that international IT outsourcing offers many organizations a comfortable and profitable prospect. Not just financially but also personally. </p>\n\n<p>I first knew that I wanted to start a company that would contribute to reducing poverty around the world when I was in India a few years ago. I am very proud that I succeeded. Because of outsourcing the employment rate in developing countries increases.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/Bridgebroadcasting","title":"Youtube"}]}
