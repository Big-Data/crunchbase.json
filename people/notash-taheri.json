In an inspiring, volatile and risky time topics such as sustainability, new economic thinking, economic risks, (de)regulation, and post-democracy have built a framework for my thinking, inspiring me to search for new explanatory modells outside my law school education. Looking for answers I got in touch with terms such as resilience, emergence, systems theory, catastrophe theory, complexity theory and network theory. Finding myself in an ocean of knowledge and on the peaks of new developments I am curious about applications, that deal with the problems of our time, that can change (stuff and people), and I&#8217;ve become curious about people, innovators, entrepeneurs and investors, who provide that kind of paradigm shift, people who are fascinated by this little light of epistemological thinking that changes ones way of thinking, ones state of mind, thus ones actions, tinkering and brings innovation and changes the world, we are all living in, to a better, less risky, less hostile world. I think especially innovators and entrepeneurs, together with those that help them realize their ideas and dreams can make that change happen, as it is already.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0014/1852/141852v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,195],"assets/images/resized/0014/1852/141852v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,195],"assets/images/resized/0014/1852/141852v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/notash_ariani","title":"my Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://tweetedtimes.com/notash_ariani","title":"my newspaper"},{"external_url":"http://techmashup.collected.info","title":"my tech news feed mashup"},{"external_url":"http://economicmashup.collected.info","title":"my econ news feed mashup"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Notash-Ariani/157544244315839?sk=app_45439413586","title":"my Facebook page"},{"external_url":"http://notash-post.blogspot.com","title":"my blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB4Q9gkwAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.google.com%2F116325967564452824862&rct=j&q=notash%20taheri&ei=8okcToP5CdHKsgbY3uzrBg&usg=AFQjCNEXe2WAkq26mv-MRjsyO4Vyn0K5Fw&sig2=AfWqXBe08qbivaTNVQgjkg&cad=rja","title":"Google+"}]}
