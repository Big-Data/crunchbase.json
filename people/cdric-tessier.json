Passionate about financial technology, vertical networks, crowdsourcing, and anything remotely close to innovation in financial services, he is co-founder and CEO of NexKap, the first web-based platform dedicated to working capital financing in France, and co-founder and CEO of Boaties Production, the innovative shoe company. </p>\n\n<p>Priori to founding NexKap and Boaties Production, Cédric co-founded Palico, the first online private equity fund marketplace bringing limited partners, general partners, placement agents and gatekeepers together – in one place – to meet and engage with qualified counterparts. With offices in Paris, London and New York City, Palico now assembles an unparalleled community of private equity participants coming from 50+ countries. </p>\n\n<p>Before realising that his life should really be about creating products and services, Cédric held General Counsel positions within the private equity industry, and practiced as a private equity attorney in Debevoise &amp; Plimpton&#8217;s New York and Paris offices, for more than 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>Cédric earned a Master in International Business Law summa cum laude and a Master in Business Law, Tax and Accountancy summa cum laude from the University of Aix-Marseille III. He also holds an LL.M in entrepreneurship from Cornell Law School in Ithaca, NY. </p>\n\n<p>Cédric is a member of the New York Bar and the Paris Bar, and is recommanded by Legal 500 as a leading lawyer for private equity in France. He is also a founding member of Finance Participative France, the French crowdfunding association.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[103,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/8684/218684v2-max-150x150.png"],[[165,240],"assets/images/resized/0021/8684/218684v2-max-250x250.png"],[[165,240],"assets/images/resized/0021/8684/218684v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"J.D.","subject":"Business Law","institution":"Université Paul Cézanne (Aix-Marseille III)","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Laws (LL.M.)","subject":"Business Law, Tax and Accountancy","institution":"Université Paul Cézanne (Aix-Marseille III)","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Laws (LL.M.)","subject":"International Business Law","institution":"Université Paul Cézanne (Aix-Marseille III)","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Laws (LL.M.), Securities and Entrepreneurship","subject":"Securities and Entrepreneurship","institution":"Cornell Law School","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Admission","subject":"","institution":"New York Bar","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Admission","subject":"","institution":"Paris Bar","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"J.D.","subject":"Business Law","institution":"Université Paul Cézanne (Aix-Marseille III)","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"NexKap","permalink":"nexkap","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Boaties Production","permalink":"boaties-production","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & General Counsel","firm":{"name":"Palico","permalink":"palico","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0019/4843/194843v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0019/4843/194843v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0019/4843/194843v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Attorney","firm":{"name":"Goldman Sloan Nash & Haber","permalink":"goldman-sloan-nash-haber","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Attorney - Head of French Investment Management","firm":{"name":"Debevoise & Plimpton LLP","permalink":"debevoise-plimpton-llp","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"General Counsel","firm":{"name":"Mantra Softech Pvt Ltd","permalink":"mantra-softech-pvt-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0009/1232/91232v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/1232/91232v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[201,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/1232/91232v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Attorney","firm":{"name":"SJ Berwin","permalink":"sj-berwin","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"General Counsel","firm":{"name":"Triago","permalink":"triago","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"General Counsel","firm":{"name":"Mantra","permalink":"mantra","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.nexkap.com","title":"NexKap"},{"external_url":"http://www.boaties-production.com","title":"Boaties"},{"external_url":"http://about.me/cedricteissier","title":"About.me"},{"external_url":"https://www.vizify.com/cedric-teissier","title":"Vizify"},{"external_url":"http://www.tikimee.com/cedricteissier","title":"Tiki'mee"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/echotraffic","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/cedric-teissier/3a/292/230","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/echotraffic","title":"Facebook"}]}
