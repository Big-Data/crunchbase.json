Before blueKiwi I spent 4.5 years at Microsoft where I worked as the SharePoint Product Manager, responsible for the strategy around Enterprise Content Management, Enterprise Search and Collaboration solutions in the UK subsidiary.  I&#8217;ve also held a number of business oriented roles focusing on Organisational Strategy/Balanced Scorecard, as well as some technical roles in the areas of Business Intelligence and Database Management. Prior to Microsoft, in the good old days of the dotcom boom, I worked as a Solutions Architect on some of the UK&#8217;s largest eCommerce sites. Before the year 2000, which is when I moved to the UK from South Africa, I held various consulting roles as a data and information management specialist.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[117,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2779/22779v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[195,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/2779/22779v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[311,398],"assets/images/resized/0002/2779/22779v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rob Gray / <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/uk/company/about-us/leadership-team\" title=\"Blue Kiwi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blue Kiwi</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
