Enzo was designing the control system of a particle detector at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland, while getting is M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Five years and a Ph.D. later, he met up with an italian entrepreneur who wanted to build a revolutionary open-architecture MRI scanner, and wanted to bring the product to market; following a dream of exporting basic research to business, Enzo went ahead and did it. At the same time, Enzo lead the effort to manufacture hardware for the first italian hadrontherapy machine (the next revolution in cancer treatment after chemiotherapy).</p>\n\n<p>Right now, he is busy with another dream: operating the world&#8217;s most powerful X-Ray Laser; as Deputy Director of Instrumentation and Controls Division at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (Stanford University), Enzo provides diagnostics, safety systems, network and dashboard for a machine so revolutionary to be compared to the invention of the optical microscope.
