Prior to joining NPR in December 1998, Klose served successively as director of U.S. international broadcasting, overseeing the United States Government&#8217;s global radio and television news services (1997-98); and president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), broadcasting to Central Europe and the former Soviet Union (1994-97).

He also helped devise and implement a strategy to coordinate all U.S.-funded international broadcasting (Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Radio/TV Marti, Worldnet Television) to save money, refocus the mission, and modernize operations in the post-Cold War.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to RFE/RL, Klose was an editor and reporter at The Washington Post for 25 years. His various positions at the newspaper included city editor (1974-76); Moscow bureau chief (1977-1981); Midwest correspondent (1983-1987); and deputy national editor (1987-1990).</p>\n\n<p>Klose received a Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, at Harvard.
