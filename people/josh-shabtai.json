As CEO of Vertigore Games, he&#8217;s building game experiences and platforms that promise new breakthroughs in player immersion. </p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s augmented reality-shooter Star Wars Arcade: Falcon Gunner debuted for iOS in November 2010, quickly becoming one of the year&#8217;s most buzzed about titles and one of the gaming industry&#8217;s most commercially successful AR games to date.  In 2011, Vertigore plans to develop multiple titles for Hasbro&#8217;s my3D peripheral, which brings stereoscopic 3D to the iPhone and iPod Touch for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to co-founding Vertigore, Josh led international marketing, business development and product management efforts for mobile app developer Vringo, and founded the social media marketing group at Ketchum Public Relations.  Among this teamâ€™s notable work was engineering and executing the PR-only launch of Best Buyâ€™s services division, Geek Squad; generating more than $20 million in earned media (for less than an eighth of that) by connecting Dr Pepper to Guns Nâ€™ Rosesâ€™ long-gestating Chinese Democracy album; and developing early social media strategies for brands like Nokia, Kodak, Dyson and Haagen Dazs.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Vertigore","permalink":"vertigore","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0008/2988/82988v4-max-150x150.png"],[[236,199],"assets/images/resized/0008/2988/82988v4-max-250x250.png"],[[236,199],"assets/images/resized/0008/2988/82988v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Marketing","firm":{"name":"Vringo","permalink":"vringo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0000/1840/1840v1-max-150x150.png"],[[169,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/1840/1840v1-max-250x250.png"],[[169,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/1840/1840v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
