In the past few years, I have taken various steps to ensure that this passion is converted to reality.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Master of Science degree in Information Technology. During my graduation program, I was a freelance web developer, giving me the opportunity to work and appreciate various technologies. I also actively participated in many co-curricular activities and have achieved awards from IT giants like Microsoft, Sun and IBM.</p>\n\n<p>After my graduation, I shifted my focus to web development using Microsoft Technologies. In my current company I not only had the opportunity to be a part of a great team, but also leading them for a few projects. During this period, I have also earned the Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist certification in .Net framework web development 2.0.</p>\n\n<p>I am also an active supporter of the open-source revolution and contribute whenever time permits. I am part of the WebLight project, a library of Asp.Net controls which uses the very popular JavaScript framework; jQuery. I have also developed a Silverlight based Zakat Calculator, as a test project allowing to me to learn and showcase the features of Silverlight. Both these projects are available at the Microsoft CodePlex portal.</p>\n\n<p>I also enjoy reading, playing table tennis and listening to music.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5731/105731v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/5731/105731v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/5731/105731v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Engineering","subject":"Computer Science & Technology","institution":"Deccan College of Engineering & Technology","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Science","subject":"Information Technology","institution":"Punjab Technical University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Developer","firm":{"name":"Creative Technosoft Systems","permalink":"creative-technosoft-systems","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0010/5398/105398v2-max-150x150.png"],[[159,27],"assets/images/resized/0010/5398/105398v2-max-250x250.png"],[[159,27],"assets/images/resized/0010/5398/105398v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Associate Project Engineer","firm":{"name":"DenuoSource India Pvt.
