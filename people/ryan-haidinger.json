With this genre in its infancy, Mingleplay plans to take it to the next level by amping up the quality and innovation. By combining true social multiplayer experiences with player-run virtual worlds, Mingleplay is ushering in a new era of social gaming which we like to call Social Gaming 2.0</p>\n\n<p>In the current market, &#8216;social games&#8217; arenâ€™t very social at all. Putting out a singleplayer Flash game where the extent of social interaction is seeing a list of friends isn&#8217;t what we call social. At Mingleplay, we plan to redefine the standard by releasing high quality productions that succeed because of their superior quality, not because of misleading marketing or spam.\n====\nAt Mingleplay we truly believe that quality over quantity is one of the most important aspects of our business model. Would you rather have 30 games that are sub-par .. or 10 games of high grade quality entertainment and social interactivity?\nSpecialties</p>\n\n<p>Professional Expertise: Company Management, Social Media, Marketing and Virtual Goods Monetization, Casual Games, Web Design &amp; Development.</p>\n\n<p>Technical Expertise: Adobe CS4 (Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, InDesign), PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Windows Server 2003 &amp; 2008, O/S: Win 98, 2000, XP, Vista, 7 , and Unix.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Network Engineering","institution":"UAT","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder / COO","firm":{"name":"Mingleplay","permalink":"mingleplay","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0007/3771/73771v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0007/3771/73771v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0007/3771/73771v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
