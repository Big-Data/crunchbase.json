He has worked for Amazon.com&#8217;s marketplace division, Exchange.com, an early competitor of eBay, and Rounder Records â€“ the world&#8217;s largest independent record label. Massachusetts-based Exchange.com was an online marketplace that specialized in niche markets, such as rare books, and eventually purchased Bibliofind.com â€“ one of AbeBooks&#8217; early competitors. Amazon then acquired both Exchange.com and Bibilofind, and John relocated to Amazon&#8217;s Seattle headquarters in 1999. John initially served as chief financial executive for Amazon&#8217;s fledgling marketplace division before being appointed director of finance, planning and analysis. He also spent two years in AbeBooksâ€™ hometown of Victoria, BC, (2003-2005) with Power Measurement - the energy management technology firm - as its chief financial officer.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Financial Officer","firm":{"name":"AbeBooks","permalink":"abebooks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/3200/23200v1-max-150x150.png"],[[185,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3200/23200v1-max-250x250.png"],[[185,41],"assets/images/resized/0002/3200/23200v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
