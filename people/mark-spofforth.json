He&#8217;s been obsessed with computers and tech ever since.</p>\n\n<p>In the Summer of 2010, following a move out of London and into the farmlands of Cheshire and, with a desire to source local produce matched only by the difficulty doing so, Mark sat down to solve a problem with his good friend of 20 years, Geoff Tidey. Lovefre.sh was born shortly afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>He breeds rare chickens, dreams about being a farmer, loves growing stuff, and loses hours in his modest and ageing recording studio, regularly apologising for the noise to his understanding wife, Claud - and their dog, Poppy.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
