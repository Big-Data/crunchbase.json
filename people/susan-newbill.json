Her work in the Office of Research, Grants &amp; Contracts demonstrated the need for a system for data management that  was  both user friendly and affordable.  Understanding the data needs of Program Administrator, Newbill set out to train herself to write the code and scripts necessary to develop the Sponsored Programs Administration &amp; Research Compliance System (mySPARCs). </p>\n\n<p>After having demonstrated the system at two national conferences in Washington, DC, Newbill was encouraged by the UT Research Foundation to form New Found Solutions for the purpose of commercializing the system for use by other universities. Since mySPARCs was created through her work with UT, the UT Research Foundation (UTRF) owns the copyrights to the system and has licensed those rights to New Found Solutions, in which the UTRF owns interest on behalf of the UT System.</p>\n\n<p>In May of 2010, Newbill was referred by the UTRF to the JumpStart Foundry which led to the team that has been assembled to successfully  undertake the commercial deployment of mySPARCs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/3919/123919v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/3919/123919v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/3919/123919v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"New Found Solutions","permalink":"new-found-solutions","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,110],"assets/images/resized/0012/3916/123916v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[223,164],"assets/images/resized/0012/3916/123916v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[223,164],"assets/images/resized/0012/3916/123916v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
