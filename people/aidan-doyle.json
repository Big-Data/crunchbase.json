I like to diversify into different markets and I teach, lecture and give advice to Individuals on how to make their business strategies more effective.</p>\n\n<p>I have an instinctive ability to think outside the box and tailor base solutions for Individuals and companies. </p>\n\n<p>My main project now is working for Koreanfashionista.com. It is fresh, new and exciting and I like the direction they are going in. We want more people to understand the ethos behind Korean Fashion and Korean Culture.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bsc","subject":"Business and Marketing Management","institution":"University of Salford","graduated_year":1999,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"CIM Diploma","subject":"Marketing","institution":"University of Salford","graduated_year":1999,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketer","firm":{"name":"koreanfashionista","permalink":"koreanfashionista","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/7137/217137v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[239,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/7137/217137v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[287,300],"assets/images/resized/0021/7137/217137v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.koreanfashionista.com/korean-bags/","title":"Korean Bags"},{"external_url":"http://www.koreanfashionista.com/korean-clothing/","title":"Korean Clothes"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.koreanfashionista.com","title":"Korean Fashion"}]}
