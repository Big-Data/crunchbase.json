The idea originally was proposed by Spill Your Brain in April of 2009. Recently, people have started utilizing the service for what it is here for, letting off steam.</p>\n\n<p>We expect that users of this site will use necessary restraint and not post secrets that are overly explicit or obscene, doing so will result in a removal of the story.</p>\n\n<p>With the current site, brand new features and cleaner coding, commenting, following, and advising has never been easier. We pride ourselves for offering membership for free and registering takes less than a minute. Thank you for your continued support and we encourage sharing the site with everyone. After all, everyone loves secrets&#8230;.</p>\n\n<p>Beat My Secret is run by young, college student entrepreneurs. Being so, times can sometimes be financially tough. If you would like help support Beat My Secret, please donate on the about page.</p>\n\n<p><em>Beat My Secret write-up on Killerstartups.com</em></p>\n\n<p>&#8216;Everybody loves secrets. Everybody loves when a friend takes him as a confidant and places his full trust on him. Also, the feeling of power that derives from knowing other personâ€™s innermost secrets plays a role that we should not overlook.</p>\n\n<p>That brings me to this site. Named Beat My Secret, it has been devised for people to tell their secrets to the world at large, in an entirely anonymous way. Once a secret has been posted, others can comment on it and also cast a vote and rate it as either a â€œBad secretâ€ or a â€œGood secretâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Secrets are browseable by category, and seven are featured so far: â€œHealthâ€, â€œKidsâ€, â€œMoneyâ€, â€œLoveâ€, â€œSexâ€ and â€œWorkâ€. The seventh (and final) category is the one named â€œMiscellaneaâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Membership to the site comes at no cost, and creating an actual account is accomplished in a mere couple of minutes. Once the process has been dealt with, you can start posting your own secrets, and interacting with other site users to the full.&#8217;</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"newest website","firm":{"name":"Spill Your Brain","permalink":"spill-your-brain","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0009/1170/91170v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,143],"assets/images/resized/0009/1170/91170v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,257],"assets/images/resized/0009/1170/91170v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
