We achieved, during the nineties a global distribution presence for our products with representation in over ten international markets. Post the dot com bust and 9/11 the art market shifted away from land based distribution to cruise ships where I distributed my work on the high seas, doing events and selling my art at auctions worldwide. All of this experience of marketing, international distribution, production, sales and auctions, prepared me for the founding of my latest venture: BidZzar, Inc, which is a collaborative commerce application for Facebook.&#8221;</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
