While an undergraduate, David served on Yale’s Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility, charged with ethical oversight of the university’s multi-billion dollar endowment. Taking this responsibility seriously, he worked to increase the transparency and openness of the committee, to extend its purview from the 20% of the endowment in public stocks to include all assets, particularly private equity and foreign bonds, and to divest from oil companies operating in Sudan and Burma. </p>\n\n<p>David cofounded the Berkeley Student Food Collective, which now operates a retail shop at Telegraph and Bancroft in downtown Berkeley. He took administrative and operational responsibility for the start up of Gather Restaurant in Berkeley, California, whose success as a community financed business has been covered in the New York Times and the Washington Post.  </p>\n\n<p>Since 2010, David has managed technology and communications for SlowMoney, a network of investors, philanthropists, farmers, entrepreneurs and everyday folks concerned about where their food comes from and where their money goes. </p>\n\n<p>David learned to hand code web pages in a course taught by the Library of Congress while he was a US Capitol intern in 1998.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/0235/200235v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/0235/200235v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[340,411],"assets/images/resized/0020/0235/200235v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David Corson-Knowles</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Political Science","institution":"Yale University","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"CloudFunded","permalink":"cloudfunded","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0020/5904/205904v2-max-150x150.png"],[[192,50],"assets/images/resized/0020/5904/205904v2-max-250x250.png"],[[192,50],"assets/images/resized/0020/5904/205904v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/cloudfunded","title":"CloudFunded"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/slowmoney","title":"SlowMoney"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcorsonknowles","title":"LinkedIn: David Corson-Knowles"}]}
