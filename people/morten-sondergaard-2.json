In many ways this also describes the bandwidth in Morten Sondergaardâ€™s life. He lives in Mallorca with his wife and two boys.</p>\n\n<p>As a young man growing up in Denmark, Morten was more attracted towards pure action than dipping his nose in books. He barely finished high school and speeded head on down the entrepreneurial road. Today he is the founder of more than 90 companies, spanning 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>After selling his first business within the chemical industry, he moved into high tech telecommunications in the late 80â€™s, creating various companies in Denmark, Germany, Spain, Morocco, San Marino, United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Brazil. All operating in the wholesale and value added service sector. In the late 90â€™s, ventures from within the telecommunications market lead to the creation of various Internet startups or SMS and Digital TV companies. Basically Morten has surfed and enjoyed these and the latest waves of prosperity - not least on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Challenging the limits of the telco marketplace you simply must be a fighter. If you top that with the ability of surviving, not only the Internet bubble but also the 2009 financial crash with cash in your pocket, one might see the framework of the businessman, Morten Sondergaard. But his core Modus Vivendi has changed. In the last couple of years, Morten stopped always eating the whole cake himself realizing that it is much more exiting to share the success being an active investor instead of owning and controlling everything himself - a shift that creates more value and bigger smiles, being a Smiling disruptive VC.</p>\n\n<p>His friends describe him as generous and ambitious but also lacking the gift of patience, almost unable to relax. Morten is basically curious. Not digging into the riddles behind the newest algorithm but constantly in pursuit of an open-minded view of the whole worldâ€¦</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,146],"assets/images/resized/0008/1147/81147v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,244],"assets/images/resized/0008/1147/81147v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,440],"assets/images/resized/0008/1147/81147v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Birkerod
