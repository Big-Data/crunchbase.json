He was born in China Mainland and now he&#8217;s on a scholarship in Singapore.</p>\n\n<p>When Zhou Tong was young, he started to be interested in computers, and soon he became the first batch of Internet users in China. Experience grows as he learns deeper and deeper, from static webpages, home network to dynamic web applications, network engineering and databases. He is quite good at almost everything about IT, so people around him often call him &#8220;IT Maniac&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>In Singapore, He has more opportunities to get in touch with the Internet, so he founded an Internet team called xWaylab, co-operated with two of my good friends - Xavier Lur and Li Zitong. We generated lots of ideas for the social web and finally we came out with some projects.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the experience, now he has a special sensitivity on the Internet trends, now he is an active co-editor and write in TechXav.com. He is also an experienced Ruby on Rails developer.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[109,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/9810/189810v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,240],"assets/images/resized/0018/9810/189810v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[175,240],"assets/images/resized/0018/9810/189810v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/zhoutong","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/zhoutong","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhoutong","title":"Flickr"}]}
