He got a taste for using the internet to build huge dedicated audiences with family businesses selling gourmet housewares online, helping create a multi-million dollar online store from a traditionally in-store-only product.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years Chris has founded, run, and eventually sold a number of small businesses. Most notably, however, was when he launched Podcast Alley in 2004, the first and most well-known podcast directory. A pioneer in the podcast industry, he worked with iTunes to provide them with their first directory of podcasts to pre-populate their store and to foster the adoption of podcasting by their growing base of iPod users. Soon after, Chris helped launch PodShow (now Mevio) as a founding member, helping grow to over 50 million views per month (a comScore top 20 multimedia company). He now works as VP of Product &amp; Engagement at change:healthcare and is Co-Founder of CarlSays.com, Checkd.In and is a Managing Director at Jumpstart Foundry. Chris received a BA from Purdue University in 2001.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4845/34845v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/4845/34845v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[347,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/4845/34845v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Computer Graphic Technology","institution":"Purdue University","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Product & User Engagement","firm":{"name":"CarlSays","permalink":"carlsays","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0009/0958/90958v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,248],"assets/images/resized/0009/0958/90958v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,448],"assets/images/resized/0009/0958/90958v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Podcast Alley","permalink":"podcast-alley","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0003/7628/37628v2-max-150x150.png"],[[155,67],"assets/images/resized/0003/7628/37628v2-max-250x250.png"],[[155,67],"assets/images/resized/0003/7628/37628v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Shirts By Mail","permalink":"shirts-by-mail","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President - Product Manager","firm":{"name":"Change Healthcare","permalink":"change-healthcare","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/4837/34837v2-max-150x150.png"],[[224,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/4837/34837v2-max-250x250.png"],[[224,76],"assets/images/resized/0003/4837/34837v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founding Member","firm":{"name":"JumpStart Foundry","permalink":"jumpstart-foundry","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0008/7805/87805v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0008/7805/87805v2-max-250x250.png"],[[291,109],"assets/images/resized/0008/7805/87805v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Jumpstart Foundry","permalink":"jumpstart-foundry","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Checkd.In","permalink":"checkd-in-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0015/1093/151093v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/1093/151093v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,145],"assets/images/resized/0015/1093/151093v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Product Manager","firm":{"name":"Mevio","permalink":"mevio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0011/0934/110934v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,108],"assets/images/resized/0011/0934/110934v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[201,108],"assets/images/resized/0011/0934/110934v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://pressroom.mevio.com/2005/09/07/podcast-alley-the-premier-podcaster-community-becomes-the-latest-member-of-the-podshow-podcast-network/","title":"PodShow Welcomes Chris McIntyre, Podcast Alley"},{"external_url":"http://company.changehealthcare.com/blog/chris-mcintyre-joins-changehealthcare/","title":"Change:Healthcare Press Release"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/theferf","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismcintyre","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://flickr.com/photos/ferf","title":"Flickr"}]}
