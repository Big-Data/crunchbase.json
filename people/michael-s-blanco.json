He is responsible for RESOLUTE Partners&#8217; day-to-day operations.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to co-founding RESOLUTE Partners, Mr. Blanco owned and operated a chain of family entertainment centers in New England. Through that business, he became aware of growing public interest in access to the Internet and the impact the Internet would have on recreational computing. In 1996, Michael and a group of entrepreneurs launched RESOLUTE Partners and the company&#8217;s first Internet caf√© soon came to the attention of the U.S. Navy. RESOLUTE agreed to work with Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) to provide recreational computing and Internet access on several US military bases. Since then, RESOLUTE has grown to become the largest operator of Internet cafes in the US military community with installations on military bases around the world. Michael currently serves on the MWR Council of the American Logistics Association.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer","firm":{"name":"RESOLUTE Partners","permalink":"resolute-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0021/6593/216593v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0021/6593/216593v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[343,81],"assets/images/resized/0021/6593/216593v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
