I truly wanted to become a filmmaker after reading an interview in Rolling Stone w/ Martin Scorsese. It’s so clear in my mind because it hit me personally. He was talking about the moviegoer of today. He said, a couple used to come out of a movie theater enthralled, talking about the plot and the questions it brought up. Nowadays, all they talk about is where to go eat afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>I decided, from then on to direct my creative energy once used to conjure up comic book characters, family-casted plays, tape recorder radio shows, surreal photographs, and improvised bedtime stories into one: a filmmaking career. I wanted to challenge that notion that cinema had become emotionally lifeless.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I produce, cut and create motion graphics for TechCrunch TV. In addition I am a Freelance Video Tech &amp; Field FCP Editor. I served as the East Coast Editor for Film Slate Magazine during it&#8217;s initial run.</p>\n\n<p>I live in Montclair, NJ. I&#8217;m an avid collector of vinyl records, thoroughly root for Cleveland sports teams, enjoy a good Pale Ale or Porter from Great Lakes, Brooklyn Brewery, Dog Fish Head, and Stone Brewing Co., and paint or draw in my spare time.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0022/2686/222686v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0022/2686/222686v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0022/2686/222686v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"Film/Video Production","institution":"University of Toledo","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/shootbydaylight","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/stevedlong","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://about.me/stevedlong","title":"About.me"}]}
