He has been involved in &#8216;Internet Stuff&#8217; since Day Zero (remember Gopher?), and has spent the recent past building out Cloud Services and VoIP platforms.  This has led to his current involvement in erlang-based massively concurrent web-scale systems and services largely based around NoSQL/BigData.  He is also actively involved in the future of Cloud Communications - and particularly in the fusion of synchronous (Voice / Video) and asynchronous (Twitter / SMS / IM / Facebook / Email / etc.) modes of interaction.</p>\n\n<p>He has the - dubious - honor of being involved in creating the first web/e-commerce system, the first java based financial services platform, as well as the first erlang-based cloud PBX, three products he may never live down.</p>\n\n<p>He has been a featured speaker at conferences over the years, including amongst others - ClueCon, Erlang Factory, Erlang User Conference, INTEROP, ITEXPO (East and West), Real Time Communications Conference, UniForum, and USENIX.</p>\n\n<p>He was previously the CTO at Vocalocity prior to its merger with Aptela (where he was a founder and CTO).  Before that, he was the V.P. of Development at Neoglyphics where he inaugurated the use of Java based technologies in financial services, and the CTO of Proxicom where he also led the Technology practice.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/4414/184414v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/4414/184414v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[301,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/4414/184414v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Mahesh Paolini-Subramanya</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Masters of Science","subject":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","institution":"University of Notre Dame","graduated_year":1988,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelors of Technology","subject":"Electrical Engineering","institution":"Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur","graduated_year":1986,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"V.P. of VoIP R&D","firm":{"name":"Ubquiti Networks","permalink":"ubquiti-networks","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO/Founder","firm":{"name":"Aptela","permalink":"aptela","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0008/9383/89383v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[234,84],"assets/images/resized/0008/9383/89383v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[234,84],"assets/images/resized/0008/9383/89383v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO / V.P. of Production","firm":{"name":"Proxicom","permalink":"proxicom","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Vocalocity","permalink":"vocalocity","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0003/3309/33309v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0003/3309/33309v1-max-250x250.png"],[[315,70],"assets/images/resized/0003/3309/33309v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Principal","firm":{"name":"IBM","permalink":"ibm","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-150x150.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-250x250.png"],[[170,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/1370/21370v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"V.P. of Development","firm":{"name":"Grey Haven","permalink":"grey-haven","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"V.P. of Development / V.P. of Business Development","firm":{"name":"Neoglyphics","permalink":"neoglyphics","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Analyst","firm":{"name":"University of Notre Dame","permalink":"university-of-notre-dame","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/22069404\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Highly Distributed VoIP at Aptela</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/42842446\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Your Business Depends on Your Customer</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/45668398\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> ","description":"<p>SF Telecom CTO Panel -
