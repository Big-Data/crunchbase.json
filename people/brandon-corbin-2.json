His focus on a project he cares about makes a razor look like silly putty, and sometimes traditional management style falls victim to that passion. As a &#8220;creative,&#8221; I found this more often than not to be refreshing, since it fostered excitement, entrepreneurship, and creative synergy. Brutal honesty, sporadic flippancy, and provocative (in a good way) conflict also arose, which I was also a fan of - it means the guy&#8217;s a human. And I like working with humans. He&#8217;s inhuman, however, when it comes to the hours he spends making his tech catch up with his ideas. His prototypes and finished work almost always left me with a sense of impatience for the world to catch up and take notice. </p>\n\n<p>Most Recent Activies: \nPublished WordPress Top Plugins with Packt Publishing.\nAdded 5 new job boards to the Sutra Network http://sutra.biz</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/8618/108618v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/8618/108618v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[255,255],"assets/images/resized/0010/8618/108618v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Maddy Corbin / <a href=\"http://www.moiart.com\" title=\"MoiArt\" rel=\"nofollow\">MoiArt</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Make I.T.
