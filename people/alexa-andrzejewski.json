Foodspotting was named a “Hot Trend of 2010” by iTunes and one of Time Magazine’s “50 Best Websites of 2010,” and Alexa has been featured in Inc Magazine’s “30 Under 30” and Gourmet Live’s “50 Women Game-Changers” in food.</p>\n\n<p>Before launching Foodspotting in January 2010, Alexa was a User Experience Designer for Adaptive Path, where she helped both startups and enterprises craft great experiences through strategy, research and design. Following in the footsteps of other Adaptive Path colleagues, she set out to build her own “UX-Driven Startup” when she realized there were many restaurant review apps, but there was no easy way to find or rate specific dishes.</p>\n\n<p>Having experienced firsthand the joy of seeing an idea from inception to funded startup, she loves sharing what she learned with others. Recent appearances include An Event Apart, SXSW, WebVisions, Big Omaha, and the Web 2.0 Expo.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/4214/74214v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/4214/74214v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[301,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/4214/74214v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science in Design","subject":"Visual Communication Design","institution":"The Ohio State University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Foodspotting","permalink":"foodspotting","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0007/4271/74271v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0007/4271/74271v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,90],"assets/images/resized/0007/4271/74271v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/ladylexy/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sethandalexa/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/alexa.andrzejewski","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexaandrzejewski","title":""}]}
