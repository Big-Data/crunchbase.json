That company was called Foresite Solutions, and Ray, as President, ran the &#8220;product&#8221; side of the business for five years until they achieved a successful exit via sale to Nelnet, Inc. (NYSE: NNI.)</p>\n\n<p>Ray served as IT Director at Nelnet for four years, during which time he envisioned and founded GoHazel, originally as a subsidiary of Nelnet.  GoHazel was an early (2007) platform-as-a-service or &#8220;cloud&#8221; Web development framework.  Ray opened GoHazel&#8217;s office in New York&#8217;s Union Square, recruited a team and led their efforts for three years.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2009 Ray negotiated a spinout of GoHazel from Nelnet&#8217;s majority control.  He is currently looking into strategic alternatives for GoHazel and developing a new startup called TagGrid.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/5995/125995v2-max-150x150.png"],[[247,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/5995/125995v2-max-250x250.png"],[[444,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/5995/125995v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Ray Prisament</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Economics","institution":"Brown University","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"GoHazel","permalink":"gohazel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0016/3697/163697v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0016/3697/163697v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[276,108],"assets/images/resized/0016/3697/163697v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Foresite Solutions","permalink":"foresite-solutions","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"IT Director","firm":{"name":"Nelnet","permalink":"nelnet","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0007/2922/72922v1-max-150x150.png"],[[162,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/2922/72922v1-max-250x250.png"],[[162,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/2922/72922v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.nelnet.com/overview.aspx?id=1465&path=nel.cor.nap.pr","title":"Sale of Foresite to Nelnet"},{"external_url":"http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/513/40/","title":"Business Plan Win"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.rayprisament.com","title":"Blog"},{"external_url":"https://profiles.google.com/ray.prisament/about","title":"Google Profile"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ray-prisament/5/411/173","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
