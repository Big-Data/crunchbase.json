And the exploration of emerging software technologies, their innovative uses, and the personal satisfaction of consistently producing cutting-edge applications continue to propel him toward ever more interesting pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Itâ€™s been a fun, fast-paced and interesting journey â€” to say the least!&#8221; says Andrew Thompson</p>\n\n<p>After high school, a website he created (â€œMySpaceSupport.comâ€) to support the development of MySpace.com â€” proved its worth by quickly achieving 200,000 unique visits and half a million page views per day, helping to move MySpace into a leading position in the Internetâ€™s social networking sector. He managed all aspects of this support websiteâ€™s operation, including its database and servers, plus key facets such as advertising â€” regularly utilizing the services of companies such as Google, Yahoo, ValueClick and TribalFusion. When he sold the company in 2007 it was already ranked among the top 6,000 most visited websites in the world (as rated by Alexa) and had returned approximately $1.8 million in profits within only about eighteen months of operation.</p>\n\n<p>Following this, a personal investment of $10,000 allowed him and a (designer) partner to open an entrepreneurial venture marketing their own clothing line. And while the clothing industry turned out to have limited appeal to him, the insights gained by the experience, along with a doubling of his cash investment within less than a year, were certainly rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>His natural aptitude and knowledge of all aspects of CSS, (X)HTML, PHP, MySQL, Flash, Photoshop, and AJAX/JavaScript soon led him back into the challenges of web development and the creation of his current business â€” BeModel.com, a professional networking website which provides aspiring models and photographers a whole new marketplace for their skills. This is truly an industry with great potential. The website itself already had 7,000 active users and roughly 30,000 page views per day within three months of its initiation. And its unique, innovative features continue to help rapidly grow its client base, while leaving competitors at an increasing disadvantage.\nA background in professional photography has been especially useful in helping him to tailor BeModel.com to perfectly fit the market niche we are in. As he has personally handled the marketing photography for some of the biggest entertainment nightspots in downtown Denver, and has done several paid celebrity photo shoots in Los Angeles, he is able to bring to the task a broader view of market needs and perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>He has managed heavy-traffic websites, configuring, upgrading and working with various servers, load balancing, managing databases and much else that goes into the development and maintenance of a top commercial website.\nAnd he consistently proves he is able to bring out the innovative best in partners â€” in a medium which rewards, perhaps more than most, creative teamwork.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Thompson is also known as &#8220;Andrew Fashion&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>He is also currently working on his own book called &#8220;Young &amp; Stupid: How I Made And Lost 2.5 Million Dollars&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[117,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/8730/78730v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/8730/78730v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[353,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/8730/78730v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman, Owner, Founder","firm":{"name":"Drivable","permalink":"drivable","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0007/8767/78767v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0007/8767/78767v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0007/8767/78767v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman, Owner, Founder","firm":{"name":"beModel","permalink":"bemodel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/8729/78729v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/8729/78729v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/8729/78729v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner, Photographer","firm":{"name":"Andrew Fashion Photography","permalink":"andrew-fashion-photography","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","firm":{"name":"Vel Renovatio","permalink":"vel-renovatio","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":8000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"beModel","permalink":"bemodel","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/8729/78729v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/8729/78729v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/8729/78729v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":120000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2006,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"Drivable","permalink":"drivable","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0007/8767/78767v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,200],"assets/images/resized/0007/8767/78767v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,360],"assets/images/resized/0007/8767/78767v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/VDfU05imdNo&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/VDfU05imdNo&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Andrew Fashion photoshoots Aubrey O&#8217;Day</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"600\" height=\"290\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://blip.tv/play/g_RIgbXkUwA%2Em4v\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"600\" height=\"290\" src=\"http://blip.tv/play/g_RIgbXkUwA%2Em4v\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Mixergy Interview</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mixergy.com/andrew-fashion/","title":"Mixergy Interview"},{"external_url":"http://juniorbiz.com/interview-andrew-fashion","title":"JuniorBiz Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.youngandstupidbook.com","title":"Young & Stupid: How I Made And Lost 2.5 Million Dollars"},{"external_url":"http://www.undergroundonlineseminar.com/UG6/young_moguls.html","title":"Underground Online Seminar 6 Public Speech"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/andrewfashion","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfashion","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/andrewfashion","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.myspace.com/andrew.fashion","title":""}]}
