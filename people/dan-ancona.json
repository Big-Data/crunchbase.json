He helped create and build interest in numerous products in fifteen years at several startups and in academia (with a research focus on visualization), but since 2006 has been accelerating the shift from top-down, broadcast style politics to a more networked and person-to-person system at California VoterConnect and TargetSmart Communications, and he is the co-founder and CEO of Democracy Dashboard. His other interests include urban design, economics, strategic communications, DJing and sailing.
