Ben began leveraging the internet to drop ship custom made speakers. His adventures lead him all over the world, establishing operations in Southern Asia and California. An original $1,200 investment would turn into a multi-million dollar company by the age of 22. After heavy research in 2008, Ben and partner, Shane Neuerburg, approached a Midwestern bank with an idea to establish a new payment network that would upend the financial services industries. They called it Dwolla. Ben would sell Elemental Designs to focus on the new project. In 2009, the privately funded Dwolla launched in Iowa and California, boasting the nation’s cheapest payment platform of only 25 cents per transaction. In 2010, Dwolla introduced the first technology to empower seamless payments leveraging users’ social networks, officially pioneering social payments. In 2011, Dwolla launched the world’s first geo-location based mobile payments. Ben also has extensive community experience in speaking, mentoring, and leadership programs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/9069/109069v4-max-150x150.png"],[[174,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/9069/109069v4-max-250x250.png"],[[313,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/9069/109069v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Dwolla","permalink":"dwolla","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,114],"assets/images/resized/0006/8709/68709v8-max-150x150.png"],[[114,114],"assets/images/resized/0006/8709/68709v8-max-250x250.png"],[[114,114],"assets/images/resized/0006/8709/68709v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Elemental Designs","permalink":"elemental-designs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0013/2629/132629v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0013/2629/132629v2-max-250x250.png"],[[322,60],"assets/images/resized/0013/2629/132629v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/31258377?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Ben Milne at Thinc Iowa</p>"},{"embed_code":"<script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?height=348&deepLinkEmbedCode=8zN21tNDrnZuucAbyyUD2IsZBtPB_dis&embedCode=8zN21tNDrnZuucAbyyUD2IsZBtPB_dis&video_pcode=BhdmY6l9g002rBhQ6aEBZiheacDu&width=618\"></script>","description":"<p>Recruiting Tech in Iowa</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_FPTma3J2Kc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>CEO of Dwolla, Ben Milne Talks Tech with TechCocktail at SXSW</p>"},{"embed_code":"<script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=pqd2I4NDrwIHShd1AwEWesQJ62QtVIBK&playerBrandingId=8a7a9c84ac2f4e8398ebe50c07eb2f9d&width=640&deepLinkEmbedCode=pqd2I4NDrwIHShd1AwEWesQJ62QtVIBK&height=360&thruParam_bloomberg-ui[popOutButtonVisible]=FALSE\"></script>","description":"<p>Ben Milne of Dwolla Talks Payments on Bloomberg TV</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.pasmag.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=543","title":"Ben Milne of Elemental Designs in Newton, Iowa named the 2008 SBA Young Entrepreneur of the Year"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/bpmilne","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/benmilneia","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
