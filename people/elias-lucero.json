The power of Doppler is in providing consumer personalization and segmentation in the e-mail blasts so the message resonates, to the fullest, with the consumer/customer, thus tracking the results of the e-mail campaign and a measurable ROI (Return on Investment), which of course is the bottom line .</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Elias helps companies simplify business processes through custom software development products offered by Common Sense.
