In 2000 he cofounded wap.at (later: Xidris) and acted as the company&#8217;s managing director until 2004. Xidris soon became one of Europe&#8217;s leading providers of mobile communication services. It was subsequently merged into the 3united AG which was sold to the US company VeriSign Inc. in early 2006. As Vice-President for Product Innovations &amp; Business Development of VeriSign Markus divided his time between Vienna and New York and worked with US media companies such as NBC, CBS, FOX and ClearChannel to launch new interactive and content services. i5invest relies on Markus&#8217;s strategic thinking capabilities to identify promising new ventures and ideas.\nFrom: http://www.i5invest.com/en/team/markus_wagner.html</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/2637/62637v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[213,234],"assets/images/resized/0006/2637/62637v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,234],"assets/images/resized/0006/2637/62637v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Markus Wagner i5invest</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"i5invest","permalink":"i5invest","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & President","firm":{"name":"i5invest","permalink":"i5invest","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/9190/29190v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/9190/29190v4-max-250x250.png"],[[300,91],"assets/images/resized/0002/9190/29190v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"Tripwolf","permalink":"tripwolf","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7964/17964v3-max-150x150.png"],[[217,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7964/17964v3-max-250x250.png"],[[392,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/7964/17964v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"DealHamster","permalink":"dealhamster","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,92],"assets/images/resized/0006/2955/62955v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,154],"assets/images/resized/0006/2955/62955v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[314,194],"assets/images/resized/0006/2955/62955v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"adaffix","permalink":"adaffix","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0005/5817/55817v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0005/5817/55817v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,104],"assets/images/resized/0005/5817/55817v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","firm":{"name":"Xendex Holding","permalink":"xendex-holding","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[92,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/2641/62641v2-max-150x150.png"],[[92,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/2641/62641v2-max-250x250.png"],[[92,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/2641/62641v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"Tupalo","permalink":"tupalo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0010/2515/102515v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/2515/102515v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[412,133],"assets/images/resized/0010/2515/102515v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"123people","permalink":"123people","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0003/1135/31135v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0003/1135/31135v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0003/1135/31135v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"3united AG","permalink":"3united-ag","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Wikitude","permalink":"wikitude","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0652/50652v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/0652/50652v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/0652/50652v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
