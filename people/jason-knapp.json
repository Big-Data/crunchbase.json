Sold SDC to News Corp in 2007 for $150 million, where product managed building and led support of the Fox Audience Networkâ€™s (FANâ€™s) ad serving / yield optimization system, 2009â€™s highest volume ad serving platform and helped plan and build sales and the sales operations organization. The system monetizes all ads on MySpace, which saw its ad performance nearly triple within months of the systemâ€™s launch, as well as additional inventory from 1,000&#8217;s of other sites. FAN was subsequently acquired by The Rubicon Project, where the SDC ad server will now power their ad serving efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Jason previously launched various tech ventures and consulted to or held positions with high-tech companies including Microsoft, Intel, and HP.
