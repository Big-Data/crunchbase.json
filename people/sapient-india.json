Then the Internet arrived and changed the playing field. Obliterated might be a better word. When the dust settled, some folded their tents and called it a day. Some talked a good game, only to find that they simply werenâ€™t built for an Interactive world. We were born for it. Our consulting and technology roots provide us with the unique ability to bridge the gaps between strategy, creativity and execution, creating a seamless digital dialogue between a brand and its customers. Itâ€™s what separates Sapient by an ever-widening margin from it&#8217;s competitors, and allows it to solve its clientsâ€™ business problems. So, you see, our past has quite a lot to do with our present. And our future.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
