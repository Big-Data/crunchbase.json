The pEMR solution will empower all patients to take control of their healthcare and will give them peace of mind in their everyday life. </p>\n\n<p>Beginning his career as a mental health therapist, Tim spent a few years dealing with a very disenfranchised portion of the population. Coordinating the care for individuals who were underserved financially and socially was a difficult endeavor - especially since this population found it difficult to serve themselves. Finding flaws in policies in the industry, he sought to pursue justice for them at the policy level by earning his Master&#8217;s degree in public health from the University of Virginia. Soon after, Tim learned that there were many disenfranchised populations in the United States and around the world and went on to earn his Master&#8217;s in global epidemiology in an effort to solve the global health crisis. </p>\n\n<p>In the past, Tim has founded and been involved in a number of successful startup technology companies. He is the founder of the successful consulting firm DesignMe, LLC, Partner and Chief Technology Officer for StickyStreet Loyalty, CEO and Founder of ResumePlay Social Gaming, The TalentSpotlight, GreenRoom, LLC and pEMR Health. Mr. Barnes is the former Software Architect for ePals, Inc. - a DC-based online social network for the educational market and User Interface Architect for Audax Health Solutions - a social networking and gamification platform for the healthcare space. Now, he has focused his attention on using these experiences towards improving the healthcare industry.</p>\n\n<p>In his personal life, Tim is passionate about education and healthcare reform. He volunteers as the marketing and technical director for DesignMe Foundation and The World We Want Foundation and sits on the board for a variety of prominent non-profit organizations. He recently started the Center for Global Entrepreneurism at Susquehanna University where he aims to give opportunities to young entrepreneurs in higher education while teaching them the importance of the philanthropic global marketplace. An avid runner and rower, he is frequently seen rowing outside of the Georgetown office front or running through the Nation&#8217;s mall.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0010/7573/107573v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,223],"assets/images/resized/0010/7573/107573v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,223],"assets/images/resized/0010/7573/107573v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Tim Barnes - Arlington, VA</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MPH","subject":"Public Health","institution":"University of Virginia","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MS","subject":"Global Health","institution":"George Mason University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"CallMeMeeting","permalink":"callmemeeting","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/1701/131701v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0013/1701/131701v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0013/1701/131701v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"StickyStreet","permalink":"stickystreet","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/9220/39220v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9220/39220v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9220/39220v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"OpenMethods","permalink":"openmethods","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0003/0347/30347v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0003/0347/30347v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,78],"assets/images/resized/0003/0347/30347v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
