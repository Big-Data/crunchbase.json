Her career in consulting took her to MIT to do an MBA where she studied under Sandy Pentland and Nathan Eagle and â€“ like many others at this yearâ€™s Etech conference â€“ became infected by the â€˜reality miningâ€™ bug. Sharon and her co-founders saw the potential in marrying the techniques being developed in the reality mining space with the innovations and flexibility of another great MIT idea, software defined radio on off-the-shelf hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Sharon has an MBA degree from MIT, an MA in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Sharon lives in the UK with her husband and two young children.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/2722/62722v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[75,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/2722/62722v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[75,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/2722/62722v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>O&#8217;Reilly Media</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, COO","firm":{"name":"path intelligence","permalink":"pathintelligence","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0000/2656/2656v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,38],"assets/images/resized/0000/2656/2656v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,38],"assets/images/resized/0000/2656/2656v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?action=vmi&id=714424&pvs=pp&authToken=zLf0&authType=name&trk=ppro_viewmore&lnk=vw_pprofile","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
