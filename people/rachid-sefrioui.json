He earned a degree in management &amp; operations research from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>\n\n<p>Rachid is the charismatic face of Finaventures.  He travels the world as a Public Speaker to spread the word about Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Anchoring at conferences and motivation seminars. </p>\n\n<p>But he is more than a chief evangelist, Rachid is a sought-after advisor as the big picture guy with a detail-oriented mind, turning laser-like focus to solve complex strategic and operational problems. He has the skills, knowledge, and experience to back up the message.</p>\n\n<p>In the little spare time he has, Rachid moderates his blogs about his random thoughts, and hits one-down-the-fairway at golf courses in visiting cities with his local buddies.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/0106/130106v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[197,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/0106/130106v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[355,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/0106/130106v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rachid Sefrioui - Finaventures</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"Management, Operations Research","institution":"Case Western Reserve University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Finaventures","permalink":"finaventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0004/4388/44388v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0004/4388/44388v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[252,64],"assets/images/resized/0004/4388/44388v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/10309607\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/10309607\">Interview Rachid Sefrioui</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user3412036\">Salah Eddine Benzakour</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Rachid Sefrioui Finaventures hosts Ignite Casablanca</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CJbv_YcnxIU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Rachid Sefrioui speaks at TEDx in France: Find your Anchor</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-06/cohan-jordan-vc-firms-forging-mideast-silicon-valley.html","title":"Bloomberg"},{"external_url":"http://www.01net.com/article/393643","title":"01 Informatique - The Leading Tech News Channel"},{"external_url":"http://www.leconomiste.com/article/le-petit-ibm-marocain-est-nebrrachid-sefrioui-president-de-finatech-group","title":"L'Economiste"},{"external_url":"http://www.lepost.fr/portfolio/2011/12/24/2667684_rachid-sefrioui-au-tedx-alsace-l-ancre-de-l-entrepreneur.html","title":"TEDx Talk - LePost"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rachid-sefrioui/13/7b9/24","title":"on LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/Rachid_Sefrioui","title":"on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/people/Rachid-Sefrioui/100002195004370","title":"on Facebook"},{"external_url":"https://profiles.google.com/104408287120110088142","title":"on Google Profiles"},{"external_url":"http://www.rachid-sefrioui-venture-capital.blogspot.com","title":"Venture Capital - Blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.rachid-sefrioui-consulting.blogspot.com","title":"Restructuring - Blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.rachid-sefrioui-public-speaker.blogspot.com","title":"Public Speaker - Blog"},{"external_url":"http://angel.co/rachid_sefrioui","title":"on Angel List"},{"external_url":"http://www.rachid-sefrioui-capital-risque.blogspot.com","title":"Capital-risque Blog (FR)"},{"external_url":"http://www.rachid-sefrioui-conseil.blogspot.com","title":"Redressement Blog (FR)"},{"external_url":"http://www.rachid-sefrioui-conferencier.blogspot.com","title":"Conferencier Blog (FR)"}]}
