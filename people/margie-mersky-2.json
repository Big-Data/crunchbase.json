This is never taken for granted as we walk the path of artistic creations. Talented hands have created things that shock each new viewer, because it is a rare blessing.</p>\n\n<p>We are a minority, us jewelry artisans. A constant stand has been to create and produce pieces that will be admired a hundred years or more from now after two generations have worn themâ€¦ Leaving a legacy for a family to cherish. Quality is the only way to achieve this. Not much feels better than doing what you love to do for a living. Technology has taken us to a very high level, yet I ask you to never take for granted what your hands can craft from raw materials, from start to finish.</p>\n\n<p>Just an artistic journey, a fine path to walk.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0020/7802/207802v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,212],"assets/images/resized/0020/7802/207802v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[290,247],"assets/images/resized/0020/7802/207802v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
