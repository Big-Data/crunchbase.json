Learn it.\nCandor: An open mind requires open communication.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a technologist for nearly seven years (since my early teens). In that time, I&#8217;ve worked with everything from soldering irons to software (in nearly every major language).</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also an accomplished product manager, technical lead, and manager of technical staff. I deeply enjoy the challenges in leadership and management; I find especially interesting helping people identify and hone their strengths while aligning them with the company&#8217;s goals. In short, I like growing and fostering effective people.\nSpecialties:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There&#8217;s greater potential for improvement. Saving half of 90% is a much bigger win than half of 10%.</li>\n<li>Front end changes are simpler than back end. The techniques you&#8217;ll use (minification, consolidation, compression, etc.) take engineer days, not weeks.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a demonstrably effective approach. It&#8217;s not only been proven at Yahoo and elsewhere, you can likely make trivial changes to your own site and see the results immediately.</li>\n</ol>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Executive","firm":{"name":"Oracle Corporation","permalink":"oracle","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-150x150.png"],[[158,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-250x250.png"],[[158,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7825/17825v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Executive","firm":{"name":"Pronto Networks","permalink":"pronto-networks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0012/2993/122993v2-max-150x150.png"],[[160,104],"assets/images/resized/0012/2993/122993v2-max-250x250.png"],[[160,104],"assets/images/resized/0012/2993/122993v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
