There was nothing available which helped the user to easily manage all their files and to share with others.  Despite a proliferation of collaboration platforms, they all seemed to require some primitive kind of upload process and then required the user to remember the physical location in which they were stored.  It became obvious that there was a real need to break the link between the physical and the logical and allow the user to store using subjects relevant to them.</p>\n\n<p>Sebastian has been responsible for defining the TopicLogic product and for managing the developers in implementing it.  He is now in charge of the closed beta testing that is taking place and of incorporating user feedback.</p>\n\n<p>The TopicLogic file management web service will be launched at Disrupt San Francisco this September.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/3277/143277v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[212,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/3277/143277v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[383,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/3277/143277v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSc(Hons)","subject":"Engineering","institution":"Imperial College, London","graduated_year":1982,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
