Known as &#8220;The Image Maker,&#8221; he is considered to be the most\naccomplished portrait artist of the 20th century. Zimmerman is sought after by the worldâ€™s most celebrated entertainers, dignitaries, politicians and influential personalities.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine&#8230; possessing your own unique Masterpiece Portrait created by an artist at the top of his field whose clientele list includes a â€œWhoâ€™s Whoâ€ of world-renowned celebrities and notables&#8230; a portrait created with the highest artistic quality that magically captures your best look, emotion and essential â€œbeingnessâ€ in a fleeting instant of perfection&#8230; your ideal image. Imagination becomes reality if you are fortunate enough to have a Masterpiece Portrait created by Dick Zimmerman. </p>\n\n<p>A native of New York, Zimmerman experienced a career-shaping epiphany very early in life while standing transfixed before Salvador Daliâ€™s â€œCrucifixionâ€ in the Metropolitan Museum. At that moment, he knew he was going to be an artist. Years later, Zimmerman was to meet with Dali at his home in Spain when he was commissioned to create a portrait of Dali and Gala commemorating their golden wedding anniversary. Zimmerman spent a week with Dali in what could only be described as a wonderfully creative- and surreal- experience, an event he describes in detail on his website ( HYPERLINK &#8220;http://www.dickzimmerman.com&#8221; http://www.dickzimmerman.com).</p>\n\n<p>Zimmerman studied at Parsons School of Design, The School of Visual Arts, received his B of A degree at NYU, and studied fine art with contemporary master Isaac Sawyer. He also served as an award winning art director for top magazines in the New York area, and at 27 was the youngest art director McCallâ€™s had ever utilized. His highly successful career as an artist spans three decades living, studying and applying his craft in New York, London, Rome, Vienna and Los Angeles. He currently divides his time between California and Florida. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to his exceptional artistic skills with lighting, perspective, colors, texture and composition, one of the secrets to Zimmermanâ€™s success is his ability to evaluate and communicate with his subject in such a way that draws out the individualâ€™s style, character and intelligence and puts them at ease, thus allowing them to relax and be themselves. Zimmermanâ€™s viewpoint is that if all the variables are controlled and captured, anyone at the right moment can assume a Botticeli-like essence and quality. </p>\n\n<p>â€œWhen Iâ€™m creating a portrait for someone, thereâ€™s definitely a moment where something magical happens,â€ says Zimmerman. â€œThat special moment in time is what I like to capture, enhance and bring to the surface of my canvas.â€ His ability to do so imbues Zimmermanâ€™s portraits with life and a vibrant spirituality, with subtleties, making it seems as though his subjects are actually alive and communicating back to the observer&#8230; a hallmark of a classic Zimmerman portrait. </p>\n\n<p>Dick Zimmerman is now accepting commissions. \n800.781.8227</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,91],"assets/images/resized/0003/4668/34668v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,91],"assets/images/resized/0003/4668/34668v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,91],"assets/images/resized/0003/4668/34668v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B of A","subject":"","institution":"Parsons School of Design","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dick-Zimmerman/17667939659","title":"Dick Zimmerman on Facebook Business"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcompany.com/user/125504","title":""},{"external_url":"http://dickzimmerman.gather.com/","title":""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1367858632","title":"Dick Zimmerman's Facebook Page"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/dickzimmerman","title":"Dick Zimmerman's Linkedin Profile"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/dick_zimmerman","title":"Dick Zimmerman's Twitter Page"},{"external_url":"http://www.myspace.com/dick_zimmerman","title":"Dick Zimmerman's Myspace Page"}]}
