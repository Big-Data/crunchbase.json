Director of Developer Platform at Ribbit, Chuck coded, deployed and evangelized Ribbit&#8217;s telephony platform to a community that grew to over 6,000 developers within its first year. As a direct result of this effort and innovation, Ribbit was acquired by BT for $105 million in July, 2008.</p>\n\n<p>A graduate of Boston University&#8217;s College of Communication, Chuck loves engaging developers and has spoken at several conferences on Ribbit and Flash platform technologies. In the past few years he has appeared at Adobe MAX, FlashForward, MashupCamp, FITC (both in Toronto and Hollywood), Yahoo! Public Hack Day, Where 2.0, Apollo Camp, 360|Flex (Seattle, Atlanta and San Jose), Dreamforce, MIT EmTech and Ribbit&#8217;s own Developer Spawn Event. Chuck was invited back to Boston University in April 2007 and proudly conducted a lecture to students and faculty interested in Flash and Flex.</p>\n\n<p>Chuckâ€™s development approach combines his education in multimedia with expertise in content management, server-side scripting and database and interactive design. In addition to his work on the Ribbit Platform, Chuck has produced some of the most highly visible dynamic Flash content in recent years, leading development for the Yahoo! Maps API and application to 20 million users. He has also launched modules for the homepages of eBay, eBay China and Fidelity. His work reflects precision while remaining ambitious to push the envelope when possible.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2007, Chuck&#8217;s first book Wrox Yahoo! Maps Mashups was released. He was quickly signed on by Wrox again, this time as lead author on their flagship AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime) book. Chuck has also contributed as Technical Editor for Wrox&#8217;s Professional Flex 2, released in May 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Born in Boston, Chuck relocated with his wife Jamie to sunny Silicon Valley, CA. They gave birth to their first child, Chase Edward, in March of 2007. Still a Red Sox season ticket holder, Chuck plans many trips back to Beantown to see his beloved team keep winning more World Series.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6166/26166v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/6166/26166v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/6166/26166v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Chuck Freedman / <a href=\"http://developer.ribbit.com\" title=\"Ribbit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ribbit</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Communications","institution":"Boston University","graduated_year":1999,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Flash Platform Sr. Developer","firm":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Flash Consultant","firm":{"name":"eBay","permalink":"ebay","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Maps Sr. Flash Developer","firm":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Developer Platform","firm":{"name":"Ribbit","permalink":"ribbit","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/2680/2680v1-max-150x150.png"],[[187,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/2680/2680v1-max-250x250.png"],[[187,65],"assets/images/resized/0000/2680/2680v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Joined Ribbit as Director of Developer Platform","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"http://www.chuckstar.com/blog/?p=48","source_text":null,"source_description":"Announcing my next move; Yahoo! to Ribbit","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Chuck","last_name":"Freedman","permalink":"chuck-freedman"}},{"description":"Won Yahoo!
