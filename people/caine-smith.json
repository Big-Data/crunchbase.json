Technology is who I am and I can support Web, Mobile, Tablet, Kiosk, RFID, NFC, facial recognition and many more. However that is not all I am! Simply put I love working with clients to use technology to transform a guest&#8217;s experience.</p>\n\n<p>I have planned, managed and launched contemporary technology to help companies simplify processes, improve usability and enhance the guest experience. The scale and scope of projects I have worked on has varied, from guest led applications to client led systems. The work has covered practical uses such as using a new resort mobile application to allow guests to charge drinks to their rooms or strategic projects, which facilitate guest access to vacation photos - decreasing time and increasing sales.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6019/146019v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,188],"assets/images/resized/0014/6019/146019v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,188],"assets/images/resized/0014/6019/146019v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/cainesmith","title":"LInkdin "},{"external_url":"http://www.cruise-community.com/awards/winners2010.html","title":"Award "}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.cainesmith.com","title":"Personal "},{"external_url":"http://www.myf1.me","title":"My F1"}]}
