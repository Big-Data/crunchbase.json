Some people ask about my name others about my surname, how to pronounce it and so on.</p>\n\n<p>â€œNitaiâ€ is a Indian Name and comes from the traditional Sanskrit language. â€œAventaggiatoâ€ is a Italian name from all the way down in the south (Lecce).</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I am an Italian citizen and no, I am not an Indian (but have traveled trough India quite a lot). But now you still have to figure out how to pronounce â€œAventaggiatoâ€ </p>\n\n<p>Ok, now back to the introduction.\n[/snip]</p>\n\n<p>â€¦and I was born in Zurich, Switzerland, but since then traveled around the world quite a lot. When I was about 6 months into this life, my mother and father decided to â€œgo backâ€ living in Italy. Since I canâ€™t remember much about this part of life, there is not much to write about other then that we moved back to Switzerland when I was 6 years old.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 10 years old I started with skateboarding, which has not let go off me until 21. Skateboarding has been good to me. I used to be sponsored by Alva Boards, Tracker and then Independent Trucks, Spitfire Wheels and Vans Shoes. During that time, I became Swiss and European skateboard Champion and traveled around the world a lot. Until 21 my â€œhomeâ€ was sorta the world and I spent a lot of time in Huntington Beach, California (where you could have seen me skateboarding with Mike Vallely, Ed Templeton and Mark Gonzales).</p>\n\n<p>During that time, I already started working on some Computer related stuff and was fascinated â€œhow to move things around on the screenâ€, not exactly how it looked but more â€œhow I could do thisâ€.</p>\n\n<p>After I stopped skateboarding (due to knee problems), it became evident for me to start into â€œanything related to computersâ€. My really big experience with computers was into building one of the first Online-Stores for selling Hard- and Software in Switzerland. Did I mention that I only sold Apple stuffâ€¦.. Anyhow, after 4 years off selling Appleâ€™s I sold my business and started a development shop developing E-Commerce applications (because my Online-Store was successful a lot of people asked me to do the same for them).</p>\n\n<p>As always with the Web there has been some changes and E-Commerce applications were not â€œhypeâ€ after some time. Luckily, I saw this coming a long time ago and already started developing a Content Management System called â€œRedakto CMSâ€, which is still in use by a lot of customers of mine as of today.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years ago I started developing on a Digital Asset Management System, which is now known as â€œRazunaâ€œ. What has began as an idea to manage all kinds of digital assets in an easy and intuitive way, has now grown into a full blown System.</p>\n\n<p>Today, one of my companies is called Razuna Ltd.. Razuna Ltd. is all about managing your digital data. We offer Razuna as an open source digital asset management for you, free to use. Also, over at our blog (http://blog.razuna.com) we publish a lot of know how articles about CFML, SQL, Oracle and more.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9225/19225v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[145,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/9225/19225v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[145,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/9225/19225v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Razuna","permalink":"sixsigns","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/1965/21965v4-max-150x150.png"],[[200,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/1965/21965v4-max-250x250.png"],[[200,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/1965/21965v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"ComputerOil AG","permalink":"computeroil-ag","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
