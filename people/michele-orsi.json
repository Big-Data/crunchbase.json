During the first year I actively developed the server side of map2app, that consists in a set of API used by all the different apps around the platform (such as PlaceGrabber, the User Interface in the browser and the web-services we published for developers).</p>\n\n<p>My previous experience was at European Space Agency for two years in Germany, where I worked on two projects: Service Oriented Architecture framework and Mission Control System life-cycle management. From the first experience I learnt how to structure different pieces of a system in order to be usable by different clients and with different business needs. During the second year I was in touch with different teams that use the software produced by the IT department: it was interesting and useful to see how a software system is used and managed at enterprise level.</p>\n\n<p>I love to spend my free time playing sports: volleyball and beach-volley during the summer and snowboard with my business partner Pietro in winter. All the activities with the body help my mind in relieving from the daily stressful activity; so that each morning I can restart my job from a clean brain!</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master","subject":"Software Engineer","institution":"University of Bologna","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Computer Engineer","institution":"University of Bologna","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Software Architect & CoFounder","firm":{"name":"map2app","permalink":"map2app","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0014/3398/143398v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0014/3398/143398v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,111],"assets/images/resized/0014/3398/143398v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Data Systems Engineeer","firm":{"name":"European Space Agency","permalink":"european-space-agency","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Developer","firm":{"name":"Econoetica Srl","permalink":"econoetica-srl","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8P3g33Jj8AE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Michele Orsi introduction</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
