At Chomp Keighran defines the product vision, corporate strategy and the customer user experience.  Chomp’s search engine is based on the company’s proprietary algorithm, which learns the functions and topics of apps, so users can search based on what apps do, not just what they’re called.  Since founding the company, Keighran has assembled a world class team, as well as advisors such as Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Rose, and investors such as Ron Conway, BlueRun Ventures and a number of ex-Google angels.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Chomp, Keighran assumed a lead advisory role for mobile products at social search company, Aardvark, which was acquired by Google in early 2010.  In 2006, Keighran relocated from Sydney to San Francisco, where he raised $6.5 million to build Bluepulse, a mobile social messaging application. Bluepulse was one of the most downloaded mobile Java applications ever; reaching nearly 2mm downloads per month and 300mm user messages per month.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, Keighran was named one of America&#8217;s Top Entrepreneurs under the age of 25 by Business Week.  As a teen, he taught himself C++ and by the time he was thirteen, he developed an extremely popular bulletin board system which quickly grew to thousands of users.  It eventually brought in so much traffic that it crashed his parents’ phone line.  Still a teen, Keighran anticipated the influence of apps as drivers of Internet consumption via mobile devices; so he developed Australia’s first geo-based Bluetooth network app and the first app store.   </p>\n\n<p>Ben is a mentor for 500startups.com and Web FWD.  He regularly blogs on Chomp.com.  He has also written guest blogs for TechCrunch.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/2052/12052v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[168,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/2052/12052v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[304,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/2052/12052v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Chomp","permalink":"chomp","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0006/5298/65298v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0006/5298/65298v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0006/5298/65298v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"AppRedeem","permalink":"appredeem","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0010/8807/108807v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0010/8807/108807v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,88],"assets/images/resized/0010/8807/108807v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Mentor","firm":{"name":"500 Startups","permalink":"500-startups","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,163],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[417,272],"assets/images/resized/0009/6288/96288v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Milk","permalink":"milk","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0013/2095/132095v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0013/2095/132095v1-max-250x250.png"],[[361,203],"assets/images/resized/0013/2095/132095v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Mentor, Incubator","firm":{"name":"Teens in Tech Labs","permalink":"teens-in-tech-networks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/3307/53307v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0005/3307/53307v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,172],"assets/images/resized/0005/3307/53307v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Mentor","firm":{"name":"Web FWD by Mozilla","permalink":"web-fwd-by-mozilla","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Banjo","permalink":"banjo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/7510/177510v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/7510/177510v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/7510/177510v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"bluepulse","permalink":"bluepulse","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0001/2172/12172v1-max-150x150.png"],[[219,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/2172/12172v1-max-250x250.png"],[[219,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/2172/12172v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Clixtr","permalink":"clixtr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0005/8370/58370v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0005/8370/58370v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,200],"assets/images/resized/0005/8370/58370v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Lead advisor for mobile products","firm":{"name":"Aardvark","permalink":"aardvark","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/7577/17577v2-max-150x150.png"],[[210,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7577/17577v2-max-250x250.png"],[[210,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/7577/17577v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
