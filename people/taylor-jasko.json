Developer. Server guy. Security buff.</p>\n\n<p>Taylor Jasko has been a computer buff for his entire life. He started learning web programming in 2003 at a very young age and since then, he&#8217;s masted HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby On Rails, Python, Perl, and many other web technologies.</p>\n\n<p>After getting his hands messy with all this web stuff for many years, he decided to learn iOS programming in early 2010. He has found Objective C and Apple&#8217;s iOS SDK to be one of the best SDKs he has ever worked with.</p>\n\n<p>Not only does he like to code, but he also enjoys getting his game on with design. Taylor has designed countless websites to name, like Tech Cores, along with messing around creating wallpapers on his Wacom Intuos 4 with Photoshop/Illustrator CS5.</p>\n\n<p>But he doesn&#8217;t only like to code and design, he also likes to get his geek on with maintaining and setting up Linux servers. And with his experience in Linux, he also has experience with high-end security. Everyone who knows Taylor will say that he always has a concern for the best security possible. And yes, he&#8217;s a full on geek having multiple SSH connections to his servers for 24/7 access.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Taylor is attending high school looking to major in visual communications, computer security, or web design &amp; development; he&#8217;s of course, like most high school students, still debating on what to major in. He can&#8217;t wait to see what the future will hold for him.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/0773/120773v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/0773/120773v2-max-250x250.png"],[[420,420],"assets/images/resized/0012/0773/120773v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Tech Cores","permalink":"tech-cores","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0011/7544/117544v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0011/7544/117544v3-max-250x250.png"],[[300,56],"assets/images/resized/0011/7544/117544v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
