He is the co-founder of what quickly became the biggest internet company in the Netherlands: Planet Internet. His latest investment is www.skylin.es, the real time photo search platform that he co-founded. Skylines launched in May 2011 at Techcrunch Disrupt.</p>\n\n<p>After graduating in communications from the University of Amsterdam in 1993 Michiel started Planet Internet with KPN, de Telegraaf and Quote Media as the primary shareholders. Planet quickly established itself as the biggest ISP in the Netherlands and became the most visited website. In 1997 KPN bought out the other shareholders, including Michiel. He has worked with both small and large companies and with commercial and non-profit organisations since leaving Planet Internet. The common factor is that all projects are innovative in the converging fields of telecommunications, media and technology. He is also a moderator and speaker, usually on the topics of innovation and entrepreneurship. His primary work is still an investor in internet companies. </p>\n\n<p>His recent investments include Dialogue Company (email marketing), Flabber (entertainment) 925 (business news) and Skylines (photo search).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8357/128357v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/8357/128357v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[361,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/8357/128357v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>copyright Michiel Frackers</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Masters of Science","subject":"Communications","institution":"University of Amsterdam","graduated_year":1993,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder, investor","firm":{"name":"925","permalink":"925","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"investor","firm":{"name":"Flabber","permalink":"flabber","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0017/2048/172048v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,69],"assets/images/resized/0017/2048/172048v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[331,92],"assets/images/resized/0017/2048/172048v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"Three Circles Ventures","permalink":"three-circles-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder and chairman","firm":{"name":"Skylines","permalink":"skylines","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0013/5973/135973v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,110],"assets/images/resized/0013/5973/135973v2-max-250x250.png"],[[254,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/5973/135973v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"investor","firm":{"name":"Dialogue Company","permalink":"dialogue-company","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"Boost Digital","permalink":"boost-digital","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/skylines-wants-to-show-you-photos-you%E2%80%99ll-love-and-help-search-for-them-too/","title":"Skylines Wants To Show You Photos Youâ€™ll Love, And Help Search For Them Too - Techcrunch"},{"external_url":"http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_09/b3670019.htm","title":"Unsung Heroes - Business Week"},{"external_url":"http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Netherlands/young.html","title":"Innovator - NRC Handelsblad"},{"external_url":"http://buziaulane.blogspot.com/2005/08/25-years-online-in-netherlands-compact_19.html","title":"25 Years Online in the Netherlands"},{"external_url":"http://www.ventureblog.com/the-economy-finance/page/2/","title":"Entrepreneurship in Europe - VentureBlog"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/frackers","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/michielfrackers","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
