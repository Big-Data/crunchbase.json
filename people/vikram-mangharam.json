He currently manages complex licensing and pricing relationship for Microsoft&#8217;s large enterprise customers - a $200M portfolio of about 150 large and mid-size accounts. During his 18+ years of professional life he has worn several hats and has enriched his skills and experience managing various teams and responsibilities and has been exposed to several industries. The common themes in his career are â€“ </p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Looked at the customer in different geographies\nâ€¢ Looked at the customer through different business models \nâ€¢ Understands the delicate relationship with the Enterprise customer\nâ€¢ Understands the functioning of sales on the field from both finance &amp; business perspective and has been a propagator of controls and compliance in some form or fashion throughout\nâ€¢ His roles have tempered him to be a fast paced, multi-tasker who can deal with a lot of ambiguity. He regularly presents crisp scenarios to very senior management while getting work done through large teams.</p>\n\n<p>While Finance has been his forte, he understands both mature and emerging businesses &amp; markets, understanding customer&#8217;s perception, product strategy and deal structuring. A set of skills make him a well rounded business/finance consultant. I feel there is much value he brings to the table as an orchestrator of successfully brainstorming, planning &amp; execution with client teams.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/7835/117835v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/7835/117835v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/7835/117835v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"International Finance & Strategy","institution":"Thunderbird, The Garvin School of International Management, AZ","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Chartered Accountant (CPA)","subject":"Audit, Finance, Accounting, Company Law, Income Tax Law","institution":"The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India","graduated_year":1995,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Commerce","subject":"Income Tax, Business, ","institution":"Bangalore University","graduated_year":1988,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder/ COO","firm":{"name":"Tech Start Up","permalink":"tech-start-up","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Project Manager","firm":{"name":"Management Consultant","permalink":"management-consultant","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Statutory Auditor","firm":{"name":"Ford Rhodes & Parks","permalink":"ford-rhodes-parks","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://in.linkedin.com/in/viman","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com","title":"@mangharamv"}]}
