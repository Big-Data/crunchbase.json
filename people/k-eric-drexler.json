Eric Drexler is a researcher whose work focuses on advanced nanotechnologies and directions for current research. He has authored numerous journal articles, and his books include Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation. He helped lead development of the 2007 Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems, a project managed by Battelle and hosted by several of the U.S. National Laboratories.</p>\n\n<p>Drexler was awarded a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Molecular Nanotechnology (the first degree of its kind). He consults and speaks on how current research can be directed more effectively toward high-payoff objectives.
