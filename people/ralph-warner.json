Widely recognized as pioneers of the do-it-yourself law movement, Warner and Sherman began publishing the do-it-yourself law books they wrote after numerous publishers rejected them. Today, Warner takes an active day-to-day role at Nolo as well as serving as chairman of the board of directors.\nIn addition to running Nolo for much of the past three decades, Warner has championed legal reforms that would make the U.S. justice system accessible to everyone. He has also been an active editor and author, writing titles such as Get a Life: You Don&#8217;t Need a Million to Retire Well and Save Your Small Business. He has also authored children&#8217;s stories, which are sold on his own TallTalesAudio label.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Law degree","subject":"","institution":"Boalt Hall School","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Chairman and Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Nolo","permalink":"nolo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[147,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/1193/91193v1-max-150x150.png"],[[147,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/1193/91193v1-max-250x250.png"],[[147,67],"assets/images/resized/0009/1193/91193v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
