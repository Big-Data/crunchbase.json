While working at Dell he acquired an Italian restaurant as an investment and was puzzled by the lack of mobile payment and SaaS Point of Sale software on the market, he decided to start build his own cloud POS and mobile payment solution to ease the life of other business owners.  Since Pascal left Dell, SalesVu has helped triple sales for his restaurant business and is now helping small and mobile enterprises around the country.  Pascal has an MBA from the University of Texas at Austin and speaks fluently French and Spanish.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"SalesVu","permalink":"salesvu","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0005/8159/58159v5-max-150x150.png"],[[202,63],"assets/images/resized/0005/8159/58159v5-max-250x250.png"],[[202,63],"assets/images/resized/0005/8159/58159v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
