The Japanese are early adopters, and actually hate to read English; letâ€™s engage them quickly with Japanese menus.  As for earning the interest and time, feedback, and recommendations from first users, we endeavor to promote, engage, and create communities in both the English-speaking world and Japanese society as well.</p>\n\n<p>What inspires us in applications creation:  Reduce suffering, connect people, end racism, or at least reduce cross-cultural communication blocks.  We get fired up about your app when it can be modified into something that will do some good.</p>\n\n<p>http://osakabentures.com</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,131],"assets/images/resized/0019/5172/195172v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,219],"assets/images/resized/0019/5172/195172v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[404,355],"assets/images/resized/0019/5172/195172v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Film","institution":"Pennsylvania State University","graduated_year":1989,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"RiteTag","permalink":"ritetag","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0019/5003/195003v2-max-150x150.png"],[[169,64],"assets/images/resized/0019/5003/195003v2-max-250x250.png"],[[169,64],"assets/images/resized/0019/5003/195003v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"OsakaBentures","permalink":"osakabentures-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://osakabentures.com/english-2/saul-fleischman/","title":"What I do, why I do it"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/#/osakasaul","title":""},{"external_url":"http://jp.linkedin.com/in/osakasaul","title":""},{"external_url":"http://ht.ly/2cgzn","title":"Prezi: Saul Fleischman, Marketing Creative "},{"external_url":"http://www.quora.com/Saul-Fleischman","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Bootstrapping-Social-Startups-2759383/about","title":"Bootstrapping Social Startups (LinkedIn Group)"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/106543258884503418039/posts","title":""},{"external_url":"http://osakabentures.com","title":"My blog - Japanese and English blogs within"}]}
