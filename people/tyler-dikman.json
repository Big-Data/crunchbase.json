Dikman describes CoolTronics as a &#8220;concierge for technology,&#8221; meant to be a one-stop shop for small businesses and home office users. Now a 15-person company, Dikman says it brought in $3.25 million in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: Clients call CoolTronics and describe their technology needsâ€”such things as getting rid of viruses, setting up a network, training workers on new software, or upgrading equipment. Then the team works on-site with customers to resolve the problem, charging an hourly rate for services. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want our customers to ever have to think about having to call another company,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>CoolTronics has over 700 clients in the Tampa Bay area, and a smaller client base in San Francisco, where Dikman now lives. He doesn&#8217;t advertiseâ€”Dikman says most clients come through word-of-mouth referrals.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Tyler is VP Business Operations &amp; Strategy at Venture-backed Redux.  The idea was for Redux, a nine-person software application and social networking company, to be the pioneer in the emerging People Discovery category.  Darian Shirazi &amp; Tyler Dikman dropped out of Berkeley and started the venture along with co-founders Max Crane and David McIntosh in December, 2006, and raised $1.65 million in venture capital in March, 2007 and $3.65 million back in April, 2008. </p>\n\n<p>The company taps into the basic human need to connect, combining a unique software algorithm with a compelling media experience. &#8220;I am not a web engineer, and didnâ€™t have a wealth of experience starting a dotcom, but I did have experience running companies, creating partnerships, dealing with legal concerns, and finding the right people to which I could solicit advice,&#8221; said Dikman.&#8221; Despite the impressive business track record behind me, I was still a bit uncertain (and admittedly, nervous) about what was in store for me in this new undertaking.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0008/5136/85136v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,197],"assets/images/resized/0008/5136/85136v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[345,272],"assets/images/resized/0008/5136/85136v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"CoolTronics","permalink":"cooltronics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3066/23066v1-max-150x150.png"],[[85,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3066/23066v1-max-250x250.png"],[[85,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/3066/23066v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Business Operations & Strategy","firm":{"name":"FlickIM","permalink":"flickim","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/3451/3451v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/3451/3451v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/3451/3451v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Redux","permalink":"redux","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/3141/13141v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0001/3141/13141v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/3141/13141v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sptimes.com/2002/05/24/TampaBay/At_just_17__this_boy_.shtml","title":"At just 17, this boy is tech tycoon  "},{"external_url":"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/11/01/331992/index.htm","title":"Most Likely to Succeed Tyler Dikman runs the kind of profitable small business most entrepreneurs dream of.
