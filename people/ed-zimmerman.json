Zimmerman chairs the Tech Group at law firm Lowenstein Sandler. </p>\n\n<p>Ed represents venture and private equity funds and tech/life sciences-based businesses in venture/private equity deals and M&amp;A and related matters.</p>\n\n<p>Ed is an Adjunct Professor of Finance and Economics at Columbia University Business School where he teaches Venture Capital to MBA candidates. Ed is an active angel investor and he co-founded and co-leads Grape Arbor LLC, an angel vehicle investing in tech and financial services companies. He has angel-backed 12 companies in the last 2 years. In addition to his personal investing, Ed founded and co-chairs AngelVineVC, a network of angels and more than 30 venture funds dedicated to assisting early stage ventures. Ed serves on the National Venture Capital Association’s Working Group on Model Legal Documents, where he is part of a select team of venture lawyers responsible for revising the industry standard venture capital transaction documents.</p>\n\n<p>Ed is also very involved in community and professional organizations and currently chairs several charity and professional boards, including Hoop-A-Paluza, Inc., a charity for children which has raised more than $2.5MM since Ed and his wife founded it in 2002. Ed was a board member of (and has, continuously since 1994 served as pro bono counsel to) the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, the Dance Company founded and run by Bill T. Jones who won a 2007 Tony Award (Spring Awakening), a MacArthur “Genius” Award and who has been featured on the cover of Time Magazine.</p>\n\n<p>And anyone who has spent any time at all with Ed knows that he really likes to talk about and drink wine — so much so that Ed was the host of Radio Uncorked, a radio show about wine produced by Infinity Broadcasting (available as podcasts at KYOU Radio). In June 2007 at the Chateau du Clos de Vougeot in France, Ed was inducted as a Chevalier in the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, where he is a member of (but can’t necessarily pronounce) the Chapitre de la Vigne en Fleur.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[113,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1823/171823v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,165],"assets/images/resized/0017/1823/171823v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,165],"assets/images/resized/0017/1823/171823v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Ed Zimmerman</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"J.D.","subject":"Law","institution":"University of Pennsylvania School of Law","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"B.A. - Phi Beta Kappa","subject":"Business Administration","institution":"Harvard College","graduated_year":1989,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Investment Committee & Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Grape Arbor VC","permalink":"grape-arbor-vc","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0017/1926/171926v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,38],"assets/images/resized/0017/1926/171926v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,69],"assets/images/resized/0017/1926/171926v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Committee Chair","firm":{"name":"First Growth Venture Network","permalink":"first-growth-venture-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0017/1569/171569v2-max-150x150.png"],[[229,90],"assets/images/resized/0017/1569/171569v2-max-250x250.png"],[[229,90],"assets/images/resized/0017/1569/171569v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Gen Y Capital Partners","permalink":"gen-y-capital-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0018/4522/184522v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,108],"assets/images/resized/0018/4522/184522v2-max-250x250.png"],[[429,186],"assets/images/resized/0018/4522/184522v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Technology Chair","firm":{"name":"Lowenstein Sandler","permalink":"lowenstein-sandler","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2010/04/14/developers-need-twitter-but-just-how-much-does-twitter-need-them/","source_description":"WSJ Venture Wire","raised_amount":4600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":31,"company":{"name":"LiveIntent","permalink":"liveintent","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0008/6101/86101v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0008/6101/86101v4-max-250x250.png"],[[304,67],"assets/images/resized/0008/6101/86101v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/EdGrapeNutZimm","title":"EdGrapeNutZimm on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ed-zimmerman/0/5a/825","title":"Ed Zimmerman on LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.firstgrowthvn.com/executive-committee-founding-growers/ed-zimmerman/","title":"Ed Zimmerman Executive Committee Chair of First Growth Venture Network"},{"external_url":"http://edgrapenutzimm.blogspot.com/","title":"Ed ZImmerman's Blog"}]}
