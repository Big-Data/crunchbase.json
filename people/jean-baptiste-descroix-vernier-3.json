He lives secluded on a houseboat, near the entrance to Amsterdamâ€™s industrial port, from which he runs all of his businesses.     </p>\n\n<p>After obtaining a law degree, a Masterâ€™s in Business Law, a post-graduate degree in Company Tax Law and a postgraduate degree in Corporate Legal Advice (DJCE), he joined the Bar of Lyon where he worked as a corporate lawyer specialized in company bankruptcy. He then founded an international law firm, which he sold in 1999.</p>\n\n<p>Jean-Baptiste Descroix-Vernier resigned from the Bar of Lyon to become project manager for the HÃ©lios Groupe, which he helped to merge with LC-DÃ©veloppement, a new entity which one year later became Newtech Interactive.\nJean-Baptiste Descroix-Vernier remained Director of the Newtech Group until 2000, when he became Director of Publication and Chairman of Bourse Magazine. The magazine was soon sold to Robert Lafont (Entreprendre Group) in 2001.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2002, Jean Baptiste-Descroix Vernier founded Rentabiliweb, a company that has become a key player in the European Internet sphere by inventing a new business: audience monetization. \nIn less than ten years, the Group has become one of Franceâ€™s greatest Web success stories, with over 250 employees, nearly â‚¬ 100 million in income, offices around the world and stock market valuation of around 170 million.<br/>\nThe Rentabiliweb Group applies the principles of the UN Global Compact.

The Descroix-Vernier Foundation is involved in projects such as building wells in Africa alongside Hydraulique Sans FrontiÃ¨res, supporting research against Alzheimerâ€™s disease alongside Dr. Etienne Baulieu and creating centers where homeless people can store their possessions in cooperation with local non-profits in Franceâ€™s major cities. The Foundation also carries out various activities to benefit animals. </p>\n\n<p>Jean-Baptiste Descroix-Vernier is Director and Chairman of St. Georges Finance, the majority shareholder in Rentabiliweb Group, and has various responsibilities within the Group, including as Chairman of the Board.</p>\n\n<p>Jean Baptiste Descroix-Vernier is a founding member of the French National Digital Council (named by a decree of the French government on 27 April 2011). </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0014/4770/144770v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,148],"assets/images/resized/0014/4770/144770v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,267],"assets/images/resized/0014/4770/144770v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Chairman and founder of Rentabiliweb Group</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"master's degree ","subject":"Business law ","institution":"Faculty of law ","graduated_year":1991,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"post-graduate diploma ","subject":"Business and Tax law","institution":"Faculty of law ","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Diploma","subject":"Corporate lawyer ","institution":"Faculty of law ","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Postgraduate legal qualification ","subject":"Law","institution":"Faculty of law ","graduated_year":1993,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman and Founder","firm":{"name":"Rentabiliweb Group","permalink":"rentabiliweb","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0005/5052/55052v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0005/5052/55052v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,120],"assets/images/resized/0005/5052/55052v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Foundation Descroix-Vernier","permalink":"foundation-descroix-vernier","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0015/3264/153264v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0015/3264/153264v2-max-250x250.png"],[[296,67],"assets/images/resized/0015/3264/153264v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"\"Bourse Magazine\"","permalink":"bourse-magazine","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Corporate Lawyer","firm":{"name":"Bar of Lyon","permalink":"bar-of-lyon","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Directorship","firm":{"name":"Newtech Group","permalink":"newtech-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xj00t5\"></iframe><br /><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xj00t5_jean-baptiste-descroix-vernier-un-patron-qui-decoiffe_tech\" target=\"_blank\">Jean-Baptiste Descroix-Vernier: un patron qui...</a> <i>par <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/Rentabiliweb-Group\" target=\"_blank\">Rentabiliweb-Group</a></i>","description":"<p>Jean-Baptiste Descroix-Vernier at the National Confederation of French Employers (MEDEF, France) </p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xil1we\"></iframe><br /><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xil1we_installation-officielle-du-cnn_tech\" target=\"_blank\">Installation officielle du CNN</a> <i>par <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/Rentabiliweb-Group\" target=\"_blank\">Rentabiliweb-Group</a></i>","description":"<p>Conseil National du NumÃ©rique, at the Palais de l&#8217;ElysÃ©e</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xbuflv\"></iframe><br /><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbuflv_rentabiliweb-2010_music\" target=\"_blank\">Rentabiliweb 2010</a> <i>par <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/Rentabiliweb-Group\" target=\"_blank\">Rentabiliweb-Group</a></i>","description":"<p>Happy New year 2010</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.fondationdescroixvernier.com/","title":"the Descroix-Vernier Foundation"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.rentabiliweb-group.com/en/2011/07/07/rentabiliweb-se-rhabille-en-trublion-de-la-banque/","title":"New-guise Rentabiliweb upsets the banks"},{"external_url":"http://www.rentabiliweb-group.com/en/2011/02/01/rentabiliweb-success-story/","title":"Rentabiliweb : Â« Success Story Â»"},{"external_url":"http://www.rentabiliweb-group.com/en/","title":"Rentabiliweb Group"}]}
