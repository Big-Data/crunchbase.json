In the same ilk as many of the Valleyâ€™s leading entrepreneurs, Dan is an interesting character. Prior to Playdom, Dan was employee #1 at Adify, an ad network platform acquired by Cox Enterprises in 2008; founded several wildly unsuccessful technology start-ups; and served as technical consultant to Wynn Design and Development. With a degree in physics from Swarthmore College, Dan uses data-driven insights to understand what players want and deliver it. A lifelong gamer, Dan has played thousands of hours of Final Fantasy 7 and Baldurâ€™s Gate 2, and spent 34 long days as a semi-professional Blackjack player. Danâ€™s commitment to the player experience runs so deep that he wakes up several times a night to check the performance of our games.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/3518/63518v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,220],"assets/images/resized/0006/3518/63518v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,220],"assets/images/resized/0006/3518/63518v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>BizJournals</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Product Officer","firm":{"name":"Playdom","permalink":"playdom","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0004/5825/45825v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0004/5825/45825v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[318,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/5825/45825v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founding CEO","firm":{"name":"Playdom","permalink":"playdom","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0004/5825/45825v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,73],"assets/images/resized/0004/5825/45825v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[318,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/5825/45825v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
