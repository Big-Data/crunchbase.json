Her core competencies reside in PR, sales, and business development. </p>\n\n<p>She started UsingMiles.com after dealing with the frustration of losing over 26,000 miles in a major airline frequent flyer program and wondering why there wasn&#8217;t a better way to manage and use her miles and points. </p>\n\n<p>Her professional experience commenced at Coca-Cola North America, where she developed and ran the fastest-growing sales territory in the country. She gradually moved into Marketing in Silicon Valley and ran the marketing efforts for an early start-up, Boomerang.com, that survived the dot bomb and continues to thrive.</p>\n\n<p>She most recently concluded working at ShopAtHome.com, one of the top 10 trafficked online shopping sites according to the New York Times, where she grew Facebook likes from 0 to over 600,000, created an active blogger network resulting in over 800 posts a month and spearheaded the first PR strategy for the company. </p>\n\n<p>Krista was accepted into the 2008 Techstars program in Boulder, Colorado. She is also a mentor for the Founder&#8217;s Institute program in Denver, Colorado, which helps early start-ups get off the ground. </p>\n\n<p>Krista graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors from the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/3866/133866v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/3866/133866v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/3866/133866v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science, Business Operations","subject":"Business, Marketing","institution":"University of Colorado","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Summa Cum Laude Highest Honors","subject":"Business","institution":"University of Colorado","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"UsingMiles","permalink":"usingmiles","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0002/3925/23925v6-max-150x150.png"],[[220,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/3925/23925v6-max-250x250.png"],[[220,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/3925/23925v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"UsingMiles.com named one of Entrepreneur Magazine's Top 100 Brilliant Companies in 2011","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219660","source_text":null,"source_description":"100 Brilliant Companies","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Krista","last_name":"Paul","permalink":"krista-paul-3"}},{"description":"UsingMiles.com Raises $2.7 Million in Venture Funding","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"https://www.usingmiles.com/press/usingmiles-secures-new-funding","source_text":null,"source_description":"Loyalty Travel Startup Raises $2.7 Million, Names eBags Founder As New CEO","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Krista","last_name":"Paul","permalink":"krista-paul-3"}},{"description":"Krista was named one of Coloradoâ€™s top 5 most influential young professionals for 2011.
