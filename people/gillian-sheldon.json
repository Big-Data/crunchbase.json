With two weeks’ notice, Gillian took a leap of faith and headed to Los Angeles to launch the syndicated program “Celebrity Justice” with Harvey Levin. There she was able to leverage her knowledge and skill as a news producer with her innate ability to connect people to grow the “CJ” brand beyond its 4 AM time periods. Following “CJ,” TMZ was born. Serving initially as the site’s publicist and then moving into the role of Supervising Producer, Gillian was essential to the building of one of the web’s strongest brands. In addition, Gillian created and managed a press list that became notorious in media circles, a list so comprehensive Gawker said it “helped the media to realize that we&#8217;re all in this cesspool together.” Following TMZ, Gillian ran several digital properties for Warner Bros.’ Telepictures Productions, including momlogic.com and ExtraTV.com.</p>\n\n<p>Currently at BUZZMEDIA, the world’s fastest growing digital media company, and working with highly successful and visible pop culture brands like Celebuzz, Idolator, Buzznet and the personal blogs of such celebrities as Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, Gillian is able to intersect all of her wisdom into creating engaging content for a wide audience that craves compelling content. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2349/182349v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/2349/182349v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,301],"assets/images/resized/0018/2349/182349v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Marketing & Communications","firm":{"name":"BUZZ MEDIA","permalink":"buzz-media-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/1777/1777v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/1777/1777v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/1777/1777v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://gawker.com/161998/10-questions-for-tmz-publicist-gillian-sheldon","title":"Gawker: 10 Questions for TMZ Publicist Gillian Sheldon"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/gilliansheldon","title":"@gilliansheldon"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/gilliansheldon","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
