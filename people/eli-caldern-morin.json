Through his studies in the Entertainment &amp; Media Management Institute at the UCLA Anderson School of Management he met some of the founding members of the early AdMob Management Team and later joined them as one of their first Ad Sales Interns (May 2007). From this position he worked to identify new revenue opportunities and helped build soup-to-nuts mobile advertising campaigns for US and global clients.</p>\n\n<p>Later, as an Ad Sales Associate at AdMob, Eli worked on building innovative mobile ad strategies and media campaigns for National Brand Advertisers and Mobile Eco-System Startups while also participating directly to AdMob&#8217;s hyper-growth by executing and delivering aggressive team and individual revenue goals. </p>\n\n<p>After a successfully stay at SnapTell (founded by an exAdMob &amp; acquired by Amazon), Eli moved to Mojiva where he worked as their lead Account Executive responsible for driving up ad sales and managing a variety of Direct and Agency relationships for US and Global advertisers. After Mojiva successfully secured series B funding Eli was aggressively recruited by InMobi to assist on their North America expansion team and efforts based in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>\n\n<p>As a result of his work in the mobile space (AdMob, SnapTell, Mojiva, &amp; InMobi), Eli has had the opportunity to work with multiple company departments such as Product, Biz Dev, Ad Operations, Engineering, Finance, &amp; Marketing to help understand and deliver scalable solutions for thousands of mobile advertising clients, app developers, &amp; publishers. Eli loves to learn, and through these personal and professional experiences, he has gained invaluable insights about early stage start-up growth, management practices, the ad sales process, business development, and the mobile industry.</p>\n\n<p>Eli received his B.A. from the University of California Irvine in Arts &amp; Humanities and holds a certificate in Entertainment &amp; Media Management from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.
