It was launched just in time to be overrun with advertisers - and converted to a pay-per-click format right before Google unveiled Adwords. </p>\n\n<p>Dmitri also published a Web Hosting Magazine, produced Web Hosting Expo trade show, and developed a web analytics service, Clicklab, that helps online marketers measure conversions and detect click fraud.</p>\n\n<p>But Relenta is Dmitri&#8217;s best idea yet!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/1394/21394v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/1394/21394v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0002/1394/21394v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Dmitri Eroshenko / [Relenta] (http://www.relenta.com)</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MS","subject":"Physics and Engineering","institution":"Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology","graduated_year":1990,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Clicklab","permalink":"clicklab","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/2968/22968v1-max-150x150.png"],[[226,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/2968/22968v1-max-250x250.png"],[[226,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/2968/22968v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product manager","firm":{"name":"Digital Nation","permalink":"digital-nation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0003/8746/38746v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/8746/38746v1-max-250x250.png"],[[290,71],"assets/images/resized/0003/8746/38746v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Editor and publisher","firm":{"name":"Web Hosting Magazine","permalink":"web-hosting-magazine","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/deroshenko","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/relenta","title":"Twitter"}]}
