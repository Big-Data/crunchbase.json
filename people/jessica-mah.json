She designed Indinero for the typical small business owner, knowing that its usefulness and simplicity would change the way business owners look at money. Founders Jessica Mah and Andy Su built the core product over the Summer of 2009, and the company has since won grant awards from Lightspeed Venture Partners in the Summer of 2009, and from U.C. Berkeleyâ€™s CET Venture Lab in the Fall of 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to founding Indinero, Jessica was the founder and technical lead at internshipIN.com, which has since helped thousands of college students find their first internships. Jessica studied computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, where she and co-founder Andy Su built Indineroâ€™s first prototype.
