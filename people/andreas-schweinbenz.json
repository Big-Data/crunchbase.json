When he founded the company in 2001, the New Economy had already fallen flat. Many companies had disappeared from the market as quickly as they had appeared. But the small group of friends who pursued the idea of communicating visually over the Internet was a different sort. In a short period of time, Netviewer became a highly profitable venture and one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. Today Netviewer is the leading European provider of Web conferencing solutions. Â´</p>\n\n<p>Ever since 1987, when he began studying Business Mathematics at the University of Ulm in southern Germany, Andreas Schweinbenz has been interested in protecting the environment. One of his first studies addressed traffic optimization. Later, he wrote his dissertation on environmental protection in Southeast Asia. While writing his doctoral thesis he played a significant role in transferring environmental technology to China. Dr. Schweinbenz has never been afraid to get his hands dirty and remained active in Asia for several years with his first company.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately his fascination with the Internet and the stress of traveling gave him the idea behind Netviewer. As the company continues to grow steadily, this highly regarded entrepreneur has found a way to merge his business skills with a personal desire to contribute to a healthier planet.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,133],"assets/images/resized/0002/7517/27517v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,133],"assets/images/resized/0002/7517/27517v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,133],"assets/images/resized/0002/7517/27517v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.netviewer.com/company/management/index.jsp</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chairman","firm":{"name":"Netviewer","permalink":"netviewer","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/7512/27512v1-max-150x150.png"],[[178,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7512/27512v1-max-250x250.png"],[[178,54],"assets/images/resized/0002/7512/27512v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
