His start-up company, CTQ Media, began by launching iSixSigma.com, an online portal that attracted more than 600,000 unique visitors each month. That site offered the largest online job portal focused on process improvement. The flagship, award-winning print publication, iSixSigma Magazine, reached more than 14,000 paid business professionals with each issue. Michael also launched iSixSigma Live!, the in-person events division of iSixSigma, producing and organizing events for hundreds of people and organizations, including the Department of Defense.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2008, Michael sold CTQ Media to Schofield Media Group, a London-based international media company backed by private equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson. He continues to consult and coach executives at staff some of the most dynamic organizations in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Michaelâ€™s passion has been focused on finding the intersection between publishing, social media and mobile devices. He founded Web X.0 Media as a â€œlabâ€ for his interests and projects, and his latest passion is KnowPro Apps (http://knowproapps.com) for iPhone.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,90],"assets/images/resized/0008/1798/81798v2-max-150x150.png"],[[90,90],"assets/images/resized/0008/1798/81798v2-max-250x250.png"],[[90,90],"assets/images/resized/0008/1798/81798v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Engineering","institution":"UC Santa Barbara","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MS","subject":"Engineering","institution":"UC Berkeley","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / CEO","firm":{"name":"Web X.0 Media","permalink":"web-x-0-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,11],"assets/images/resized/0008/1596/81596v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,19],"assets/images/resized/0008/1596/81596v2-max-250x250.png"],[[387,30],"assets/images/resized/0008/1596/81596v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder / CEO","firm":{"name":"CTQ Media","permalink":"ctq-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0020/6582/206582v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[226,75],"assets/images/resized/0020/6582/206582v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[226,75],"assets/images/resized/0020/6582/206582v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Ideal Media, a division of London-based Schofield Media Group, funding by private equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson, has acquired high-tech b-to-b company CTQ Media, and its iSixSigma subsidiary.","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://www.foliomag.com/2008/schofield-media-buys-ctq","source_text":null,"source_description":"Schofield Media Buys CTQ","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Cyger","permalink":"michael-cyger-2"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
