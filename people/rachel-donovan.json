As an adult, it has shocked me how disposable and disconnected some communities have become. People feel too busy and unable to slow down to get to know those around them. I believe that OhSoWe can be the bridge to connect individuals into neighbors to share, advocate, save resources, and trust each other.</p>\n\n<p>As a web developer, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make peoples lives simpler, more efficient, and higher quality using technology. In my past life I was helping state governments save money and resources by implementing elearning, assisting commute.com in connecting people with alternative travel options, and saving paper through various systems. Iâ€™m excited to be connecting my expertise, my experiences and my passion to help build something so important to the sustainability of our future with the OhSoWe team.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Web Developer","firm":{"name":"OhSoWe","permalink":"ohsowe","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,33],"assets/images/resized/0014/5769/145769v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,33],"assets/images/resized/0014/5769/145769v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,33],"assets/images/resized/0014/5769/145769v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
