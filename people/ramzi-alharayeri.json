During his tenure at Actiontec as its VP of OEM sales and GM of its wireless division, Ramzi led the team that:\nDesigned, manufactured and launched the first V.90 internal modem in 1997 for notebooks which at that time netted Actiontec 100% of the modems shipped in Gateway, Dell, IBM and some HP notebooks.  This was accomplished as a result of a strategic partnership with Lucent to use Lucentâ€™s V.90 Chip. \nIn 2000, Ramzi struck a strategic alliance with Intersil which at that time had the first Wi-Fi Chip and led the team who designed and manufactured the first embedded Wi-Fi modules in PC Notebooks. Actiontec then launched a series of access points and wireless products that ranked it as one of the most distinguished wireless technology providers. In Addition to Wi-Fi, Ramzi introduced to the industry the embedded Bluetooth modules in PC Notebooks.\nIn 2005, Ramzi founded Wi2Wi which was the first multi functional wireless SiP (System in Package). Wi2Wi built its products by stacking Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS silicon from suppliers such as Marvell, CSR and SiRF.\nIn 2008, Ramzi founded XimoXi and patented the first Bluetooth mobile application that allows mobile users to discover members of a social network in the vicinity by personal attributes including picture and name.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,124],"assets/images/resized/0008/8883/88883v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,149],"assets/images/resized/0008/8883/88883v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,149],"assets/images/resized/0008/8883/88883v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"GM/VP","firm":{"name":"Actiontec electronics","permalink":"actiontec-electronics","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO, Founder","firm":{"name":"XimoXi","permalink":"ximoxi","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/9072/89072v1-max-150x150.png"],[[132,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/9072/89072v1-max-250x250.png"],[[132,51],"assets/images/resized/0008/9072/89072v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO, Founder","firm":{"name":"Wi2Wi","permalink":"wi2wi","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0022/1568/221568v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,62],"assets/images/resized/0022/1568/221568v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[166,62],"assets/images/resized/0022/1568/221568v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"GM/VP","firm":{"name":"Actiontec","permalink":"actiontec","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
