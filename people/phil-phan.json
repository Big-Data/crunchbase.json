He co-founded Sharelendar because it was difficult to share his schedules, free time and plans with his friends in an interactive way.  His group of friends are very busy and there was no service that focuses on communication between close friends like Sharelendar can. </p>\n\n<p>Sharelendar is the next generation of personal planners.  It&#8217;s like a social version of Outlook. By next generation, we mean planners are able to interact with other planners and share everything from our work/school schedule to our free time.  Of course we can make personal events private. </p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, our personal and social events are combined together.  The data are secured so friends can not see our personal events.  However, they can see and interact with our social events.  This combo will eliminate confusion, missed appointments or get-together.  The result is we will be completely in synced with our personal and social life.  </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
