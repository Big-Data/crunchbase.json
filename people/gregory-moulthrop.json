Localvore helps support the movement towards local purchasing and local economies that not only benefit the producer of goods and consumer but supports socially responsible supply chains. Localvore is a tool that will provide visibility of local suppliers to retailers in their area and help the two businesses establish a connection through Localvore’s “Social Media” features designed for businesses.  Additional features that Localvore supports include robust search capabilities based on the type of product the retailer is looking for or by suppliers in the area. Once a retailer found what they are looking for Localvore can create and allow the user to manage online transactions for purchases made through Localvore’s virtual marketplace. Suppliers can also manage their entire inventory online, in addition to their company profile and user’s access. Localvore is built using the latest technology for web application development and is hosted using cost effective cloud computing services to keep our infrastructure costs low so we can pass along our savings to the user.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Graduate","subject":"Supply Chain Management","institution":"University of San Diego","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Graduate","subject":"Supply Chain Management","institution":"University of San Diego","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.econtechsys.com","title":"Economic Technology Systems  Homepage"},{"external_url":"https://localvore.econtechsys.com","title":"Localvore by Economic Technology Systems"}]}
