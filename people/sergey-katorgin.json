Already in primary school he subscribed to specialised computer magazines, and in secondary school won the city programming competition. As a hobby, he made model aircrafts for two years. This taught him patience because it takes about 2 months to put together all of the parts before a plane can fly.</p>\n\n<p>Once Sergey took part in a training event devoted to developing one’s organisational skills. The participants were asked the question: “Are people born leaders, or do they become leaders?”. Sergey was the only one who said: “They become leaders”. Today, he strives to prove this by constantly working to improve himself and the world around him.</p>\n\n<p>Sergey is a graduate of the Automation and Computer Science faculty of Tomsk Polytechnic University. During his time at university, he gathered a team of four like-minded friends to develop a browser game. They worked out the logical elements of the game, developed a design, created 3D-models of weapons and an internet website.\nIn his second year at university, Sergey organised a web-studio, which he successfully managed for 5 years. The studio was then purchased and transformed into the Tomsk branch of EDISON Software Development Centre. Sergey rightly remains at the helm, heading up the branch with his unique blend of creativity, ambition and initiative.\nSergey is a very versatile person: a family man, a fan of film and cinema, a poet and musician. He plays basketball and is interested in psychology.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0017/2537/172537v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,212],"assets/images/resized/0017/2537/172537v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,255],"assets/images/resized/0017/2537/172537v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Tomsk Polytechnic University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of the Tomsk Office","firm":{"name":"EDISON Software Development Centre","permalink":"edison-software-development-centre","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,108],"assets/images/resized/0017/2532/172532v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,108],"assets/images/resized/0017/2532/172532v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,108],"assets/images/resized/0017/2532/172532v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=121957369","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
