In 1998 he founded one of New Zealand&#8217;s earliest web hosting firms, allowing him to accumulate a wealth of knowledge of web architectures. Shortly after his graduation from university he exited the hosting company through a trade sale to an Australian web host.</p>\n\n<p>James founded and now facilitates the New Zealand PHP Users Group, an active network of over 850 local web developers. He has had articles published on web programming and security and is a regular guest lecturer at tertiary institutes in Auckland.</p>\n\n<p>Building on his previous successes, James then founded Nerds Inc., an Auckland-based web development consultancy which worked with Top 200 clients to refine and implement their online strategies. In 2007 he again exited through a trade sale that re-branded the company Blink Interactive, a firm which continues today with many of the same customers, staff and partners.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006 James joined Michael Turner in building Eventfinder - a world class integrated event marketing, syndication and ticketing platform. The Eventfinder Platform makes it easy for event promoters, organisers and venues to list their events for free, have that information distributed to a range of content syndication partners, and control their own ticket sales, reporting and validation using award-winning SaaS tools.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0022/1085/221085v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0022/1085/221085v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0022/1085/221085v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Webstock</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"Operations Management, Information Systems","institution":"The University of Auckland Business School","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"The University of Auckland","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CTO","firm":{"name":"Eventfinda","permalink":"eventfinder","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0016/2851/162851v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0016/2851/162851v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0016/2851/162851v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
