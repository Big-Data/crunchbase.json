He&#8217;s the technically savvy, better looking half of the dynamic duo that founded the company.</p>\n\n<p>With twelve years of mobile product development under his belt, Andy has seen and done a lot of things. From back when two-way pagers seemed like the coolest technology to trump a Zip drive through to today, he&#8217;s been dreaming up, building and shipping consumer apps and business apps - before even the term &#8220;app&#8221; was invented. His product creations have led to public company mergers and buyouts, as well as propelled small dreamy startups into real existence.</p>\n\n<p>Andy is currently running his third successful startup, Thumb Arcade, and enjoying every minute of it. His kids think he&#8217;s a rock star - not because he does session work on electric guitar, but because he makes games. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/9465/119465v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/9465/119465v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/9465/119465v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Player 01 (CEO)","firm":{"name":"Thumb Arcade","permalink":"thumb-arcade","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5816/105816v2-max-150x150.png"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/5816/105816v2-max-250x250.png"],[[448,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/5816/105816v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"Selfpubd","permalink":"selfpubd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/2485/212485v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/2485/212485v2-max-250x250.png"],[[366,366],"assets/images/resized/0021/2485/212485v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://issuu.com/anbmedia/docs/royjune10","title":"Royalie$ Magazine interview with Andy Rosic"},{"external_url":"http://vimeo.com/10240632","title":"Metro Livin' It Up (Andy Rosic coordinator) [VIDEO]"},{"external_url":"http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/159901619/top-channel-executives-2005.htm;jsessionid=m91ZZtFffHaY3yDHGVvO8w**.ecappj03?pgno=4","title":"Top Channel Executive 2005 - Andy Rosic"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/arosic","title":"Andy Rosic on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/arosic","title":"Andy Rosic on LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://unmarket.posterous.com","title":"Andy Rosic's blog"},{"external_url":"http://about.me/andyrosic","title":"About me"}]}
