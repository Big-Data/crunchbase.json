He emigrated with his family from Russia to the U.S. in 1978, and became an American citizen in 1984.  He received a masterâ€™s in computer science from Columbia University and an MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1989. In the West, he is known as Len Blavatnik.</p>\n\n<p>In 1986 he founded Access Industries, a New York-based international industrial group, of which he is Chairman and President. Access has long-term strategic holdings in Europe, North and South America. Initially, he moved into Russian investments, just after the fall of communism. With a friend from University, Viktor Vekselberg, he formed the Renova investment vehicle, and the two joined with Mikhail Fridmanâ€™s Alfa Group to form the AAR venture. Access has diversified its portfolio to include investments in industries such as oil, aluminum, petrochemicals and plastics, telecommunications, media, and real estate.</p>\n\n<p>AAR gained a controlling stake in Russian oil company TNK through privatisation auctions, then in 2003 sold a 50% stake to British Petroleum to form TNK-BP, one of Russiaâ€™s largest oil companies, for which he serves on the board of directors.</p>\n\n<p>Access Industries bought petrochemicals and plastics manufacturer Basell Polyolefins from Royal Dutch Shell and BASF in August 2005, and subsequently merged it with Lyondell Chemical Company to create LyondellBasell Industries, the worldâ€™s third largest chemical company based on net sales.</p>\n\n<p>On January 6, 2009, the U.S. operations of LyondellBasell Industries filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p>On April 30, 2010, LyondellBasell announced its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a significantly improved financial position. As part of its exit financing, LyondellBasell raised $3.25 billion of first priority debt as well as $2.8 billion through the rights offering jointly underwritten by Access Industries, Apollo Management and Ares Management. </p>\n\n<p>Blavatnik also has interests in UC RUSAL, the worldâ€™s largest aluminum producer, where he sits on the board, and Warner Music Group.\nMr. Blavatnik provides financial support and remains engaged in numerous educational pursuits.
