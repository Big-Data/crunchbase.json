He holds two master&#8217;s degrees in early Christian history from Harvard Divinity School, and he is currently a Ph.D. student in the New Testament department at the University of Chicago. Jon&#8217;s recent academic research interests include the Apocalypse of John, Plutarch&#8217;s Isis and Osiris, and the history and current uses of technology in the humanities. His first book, Inside the Machine: An Illustrated Introduction to Microprocessors and Computer Architecture, was published by No Starch Press in 2007. In his spare time, Jon trains Kendo at U of C&#8217;s Kendo club and occasionally at Choyokan dojo on Chicago&#8217;s northside. He also periodically guest-blogs on the topic of religion and politics at The Big Con, a publication of the Campaign for America&#8217;s Future. As a co-founder and co-owner of Ars Technica, Jon can be as humorless as he likes in his bio, deviating from the bio guidelines in his omission of the requiste note of whimsy that signals to the reader that he doesn&#8217;t take himself too seriously. Jon lives in Elmhurst, IL with his lovely wife, Christina, and their two dogs,  Bently and Emet.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,117],"assets/images/resized/0001/8756/18756v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,117],"assets/images/resized/0001/8756/18756v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,117],"assets/images/resized/0001/8756/18756v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/3q00/arsparty/boston2k-2.html\" title=\"Ars Technica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ars Technica</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Computer Engineering","institution":"Moti Lal nehru","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Masters","subject":"Christian History","institution":"Harvard Divinity School","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Ars Technica","permalink":"ars-technica","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/8751/18751v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8751/18751v2-max-250x250.png"],[[277,84],"assets/images/resized/0001/8751/18751v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
