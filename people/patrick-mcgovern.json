McGovern is Founder and Chairman of International Data Group (IDG), the worldâ€™s leading technology media, events and research company, with annual revenues in 2008 of $3.2 billion.</p>\n\n<p>McGovernâ€™s career in publishing began while he was a student at MIT, when he applied for a part-time editorial job at Computers and Automationâ€”the first U.S. computer magazine. He was promptly named associate editor and became associate publisher upon his graduation from MIT in 1959 with a degree in biophysics.</p>\n\n<p>In 1964, with the computer industry still in its infancy, McGovern founded International Data Corporation (IDC), now an IDG research subsidiary, to provide the industry with timely and reliable statistics on information technology markets. Three years later, McGovern launched Computerworld, a weekly newspaper dedicated to keeping computer buyers abreast of industry and product news.</p>\n\n<p>Computerworld became IDGâ€™s flagship publication and in 1972, McGovern began exporting the Computerworld concept, launching Shukan Computer in Japan. By â€œthinking globally but acting locally,â€ a strategy that continues to guide IDGâ€™s worldwide expansion, McGovern ensured that the Japanese publication would not be a Computerworld clone. From the start, it was edited and managed by a Japanese staff whose mission was to satisfy readers through a superior editorial product tailored to local market needs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[117,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6095/46095v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,230],"assets/images/resized/0004/6095/46095v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,230],"assets/images/resized/0004/6095/46095v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>IDG.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Chairman","firm":{"name":"International Data Corp","permalink":"international-data-corp","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0004/6094/46094v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/6094/46094v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/6094/46094v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.redherring.com/Home/5202","source_description":"Red Herring","raised_amount":17000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":1999,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Salesforce","permalink":"salesforce","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0001/1691/11691v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,195],"assets/images/resized/0001/1691/11691v3-max-250x250.png"],[[300,235],"assets/images/resized/0001/1691/11691v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<embed src=\"http://vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=8845_IDG_02.flv&b=2&i=8845&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://vator.tv/news/show/2010-04-29-challenges-facing-media-giant-idg-part-ii\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed>","description":""}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
