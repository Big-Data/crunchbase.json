He is the co-founder of Zagster (formerly CityRyde), which he has built from a consulting business into a thriving software company and a fast-rising name in the fields of bike sharing and sustainability. Zagster has grown continually thanks in part to the persistence of Timothy and his team in concluding multiple successful rounds of angel investment. Timothy has represented Zagster nationally in publications such as Entrepreneur Magazine, US News and World Report, and Fast Company. He has been involved with several nonprofit organizations, including the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, and has guest lectured on entrepreneurship and volunteered his time at several Philadelphia-area universities. Timothy is the founder and chair of the monthly Entrepreneur Round Table at the Pyramid Club. He started his first company, Pointplex Technology, in 2001, and has worked in IT for a variety of companies, from startups to Fortune 500 businesses. A native of Fair Lawn, N.J., Timothy is a graduate of Drexel University with a degree in Business Administration and a concentration in Legal Studies, and is the 2010 winner of Drexel&#8217;s Young Alumni Entrepreneur Award. His interests include skiing, traveling, cooking, technology and, of course, cycling.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/6016/136016v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[177,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/6016/136016v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[205,288],"assets/images/resized/0013/6016/136016v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>CityRyde</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS in Business Administration","subject":"Legal Studies","institution":"Drexel University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Zagster","permalink":"zagster","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/5531/95531v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,55],"assets/images/resized/0009/5531/95531v9-max-250x250.png"],[[270,60],"assets/images/resized/0009/5531/95531v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/02/21/cityrydes-bike-sharing-software-close-to-being-awarded-carbon-credit-certification","title":""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/tjericson","title":"Timothy Ericson's LinkedIn"}]}
