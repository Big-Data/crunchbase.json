He formed Mediaguide as a joint venture with ASCAP, where he developed and implemented an automated tracking system to help ASCAP better monitor, collect, and disburse payments to rightsholders while simultaneously expanding the royalty base. George also co-founded ConneXus, where he created a revolutionary service that let consumers identify and purchase music they hear on ordinary radio using only their mobile phone. Prior to his foray into new media, George worked at two DoD think tanks, where he advised the Offices of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Air Force and other agencies in the development, acquisition, test and evaluation, launch and operation of various national security satellites. George earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University, an MS in Applied Mechanics from Cal Tech, and an MBA from the Harvard Business School.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[92,92],"assets/images/resized/0011/4775/114775v1-max-150x150.png"],[[92,92],"assets/images/resized/0011/4775/114775v1-max-250x250.png"],[[92,92],"assets/images/resized/0011/4775/114775v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer ","firm":{"name":"LimeExchange.com","permalink":"limeexchange","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0011/4773/114773v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[189,37],"assets/images/resized/0011/4773/114773v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[189,37],"assets/images/resized/0011/4773/114773v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
