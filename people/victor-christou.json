Thanks to his tremendous expertise in high tech and especially clean technology companies he will make important contributions to the strategic and operational development of our portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>In 1997, Victor founded Opsys, an organic electronics business focusing on organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and took the company from an idea on a piece of paper to a world leading technology provider with activities in the UK, USA and Japan. He was a member of the team that sold Opsys to Cambridge Display Technology (now owned by Sumitomo Chemicals) in 2002. Following the sale of Opsys, Victor crossed over and became a venture investor, first with Oxford Capital Partners where he led cleantech investments and then as a consultant to one of the UK&#8217;s leading low-carbon investors, CT Investment Partners. As a result, Victor has built considerable experience on both sides of the investment table, almost exclusively in the cleantech sector. Victor has led over twenty investments in venture backed businesses including Helveta, Green Biologics and Concurrent Thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Victor has a BSc and PhD in Chemistry from Imperial College, London and was a Sloan Fellow in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. In the early stages of his career, Victor was an academic, spending time researching in materials at the University of California in Berkeley and then at the University of Oxford, where he was a Royal Society University Research Fellow and Junior Research Fellow at Balliol College. Victor was the Royal Society of Chemistry Entrepreneur of the Year in 2002.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Director","firm":{"name":"Intamac Systems","permalink":"intamac-systems","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/1163/71163v1-max-150x150.png"],[[178,45],"assets/images/resized/0007/1163/71163v1-max-250x250.png"],[[178,45],"assets/images/resized/0007/1163/71163v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","firm":{"name":"Wellington Partners","permalink":"wellington-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0001/9753/19753v1-max-150x150.png"],[[237,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/9753/19753v1-max-250x250.png"],[[237,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/9753/19753v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Director","firm":{"name":"Green Biologics","permalink":"green-biologics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0005/9804/59804v1-max-150x150.png"],[[168,72],"assets/images/resized/0005/9804/59804v1-max-250x250.png"],[[168,72],"assets/images/resized/0005/9804/59804v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Director","firm":{"name":"Helveta","permalink":"helveta","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[194,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[194,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Director","firm":{"name":"Veryan Medical","permalink":"veryan-holdings","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0016/0128/160128v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0016/0128/160128v1-max-250x250.png"],[[263,89],"assets/images/resized/0016/0128/160128v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Director","firm":{"name":"Helveta","permalink":"helveta","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-150x150.png"],[[194,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-250x250.png"],[[194,101],"assets/images/resized/0007/0985/70985v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Director","firm":{"name":"Concurrent Thinking","permalink":"concurrent-thinking","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[72,72],"assets/images/resized/0009/3369/93369v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[72,72],"assets/images/resized/0009/3369/93369v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[72,72],"assets/images/resized/0009/3369/93369v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
