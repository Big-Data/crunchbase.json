He also worked as a development hack for Dogstar Films, the company responsible for such quality entertainments as 200 Cigarettes and Pushing Tin.</p>\n\n<p>Some highlights from Chipâ€™s life in food: his dadâ€™s legendary â€œBrantley breakfast,â€ the summer he worked in the kitchen at Frank Stittâ€™s Highlands Bar &amp; Grill, and the phone call he had with Julia Child in the summer of 2001. For the past decade, he has worked as a freelance food and culture writer, contributing to such publications as Slate, the Boston Globe, the Oxford American and Gastronomica. His book about the pluot and its creator Floyd Zaiger will be published by Bloomsbury in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>A native of Alabama, Chip now lives in western Massachusetts with his wife Elizabeth, their son Angus, and their one-eyed cat, Evangeline.
