He was the point person in financing the company, raising all of its capital needs from professional institutions that included Vector Capital, MVC Capital and Big Sky Partners. His roles at the company included CEO, SVP of Business Development and Board Member. His major accomplishments at ProcessClaims were helping steer the company thru both the April 2000 tech bust and the 9-11 crisis to help bring the company to profitability in June of 2002. In the face of large public and private competitors, including ADP (NYSE: ADP), CCC (NDQ:CCCG) and Accenture (NYSE: ACN), the company grew to be a formidable player in the insurance claims software space. Mr. Ferrara helped lead the cash sale of the company in June of 2006 to CCC Information System of Chicago for a substantial gain for its investors. Prior to ProcessClaims, Mr. Ferrara co-founded Integrated Collision Management, Inc. (â€œICMâ€), a software company that provides management tools to the collision repair industry, which was sold to CCC Information Systems in March of 2007. Prior to ICM, he joined Sea Breeze Collision Centers and helped the existing ownership build it into a prominent chain of collision repair centers in Orange County, CA, which was sold to AutoNation (NYSE:AN) in October of 1998. He has a B.A. in Economics from Bucknell University.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Big Sky Partners","permalink":"big-sky-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0003/9846/39846v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0003/9846/39846v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[314,110],"assets/images/resized/0003/9846/39846v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Venture Partner","firm":{"name":"Greenhouse Capital Partners","permalink":"greenhouse-capital-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0005/0079/50079v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0005/0079/50079v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[280,99],"assets/images/resized/0005/0079/50079v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
