She remembers a smaller, quieter Portlandâ€”before Wi-Fi cafes, farmers markets, sushi bars, vegan bakeries, condos and in-fill housing, before people even thought about keeping Portland weird. She has written about food and health, from tofu to walking shoes, for magazines and newspapers. In her â€œday jobâ€ Martha edits and proofreads countless words for colleges, nonprofits and businesses. She also sings in the Portland Peace Choir, volunteers with two local nonprofits, frequents farmers markets and practices yoga. She has sampled life in seven P-town neighborhoods and currently lives in Cully.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[52,52],"assets/images/resized/0010/6298/106298v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[52,52],"assets/images/resized/0010/6298/106298v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[52,52],"assets/images/resized/0010/6298/106298v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Contributor","firm":{"name":"Neighborhood Notes","permalink":"neighborhood-notes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.neighborhoodnotes.com/author/martha/","title":"Neighborhood Notes Blog"}]}
