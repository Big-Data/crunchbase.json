There were tight requirements: spending $1.2 million in 12 months, collecting requirements from 19 jurisdictions, taking inventory of what information was currently shared.  Local agencies were not use to sharing information at that time.  Dahyu was able to bring them together which was a monumental accomplishment . Despite approval from his management team, he knew the only way to get a DC-based program to work was to persuade local agencies to share information. This had to be done by building up personal and meaningful relationships to gain trust in the shortest possible time. To do this, Dahyu defined a purpose, or â€œWhyâ€ for the project and created visuals to share with each CIO and Public Safety Officer that matched to their &#8220;Why&#8221;.  These images showed not what was being proposed, but why they would care and how it imapcted their goals.   </p>\n\n<p>After 3 months of relationship building, he was able to convene the key decision-makers to collaborate on this non-mandated program. The secret to this anomaly was to understand the motivation factors for each jurisdiction and aligning that with the programâ€™s goals.  This required listening, navigating the political field and blending the agendas of the Federal, State and Local agencies involved.  Dahyu was able to accomplish in six months what many thought would take two years. </p>\n\n<p>Related Training:\nDahyu has completed trainings with the top names and courses in the personal performance industry and social intelligence: Daniel Goldman, Dale Carnegie; Silva; Tony Robbins; NLP; the C Executive Leadership Program at HP; Landmark Education; Jack Canfield; Rockefeller Habits; Holden Sales Leadership Training, as well as spiritual retreats in India.  He is certified in Competitive Intelligence from the prestigious Fuld Academy.</p>\n\n<p>Related Experience:\nHolding positions as Social Architect and Competitive Intelligence Officer, Dahyu quickly understood the importance of his role as the â€œconnectorâ€ among sales, marketing and R&amp;D for business success at several start ups and at Hewlett Packard. He was able to take that knowledge to work with Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and non-profits, helping them bridge traditional boundaries and form powerful connections that resulted in explosive growth and profitable mergers and acquisitions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/8670/128670v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/8670/128670v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[301,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/8670/128670v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Electrical Engineering","institution":"New York Institute of Technology","graduated_year":1995,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Aerospace Engr, AstroPhysics, minor Modern Dance","institution":"Cornell University","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"TappedIn","permalink":"tapped-in","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,26],"assets/images/resized/0012/8509/128509v9-max-150x150.png"],[[100,26],"assets/images/resized/0012/8509/128509v9-max-250x250.png"],[[100,26],"assets/images/resized/0012/8509/128509v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oi5Z_63-Byk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Social Networking Problem</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.intellectstrategies.com/dahyu_bio","title":"Bio"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/dahyu","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/dahyu","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
