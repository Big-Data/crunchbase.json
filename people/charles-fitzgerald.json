Ever since, heâ€™s been helping Microsoft position itself against its enterprise competitors. On Fitzgeraldâ€™s Platformonomics blog, he skewered regularly IBM, Sun, Oracle, Google and other Microsoft competitors.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently, Fitzgerald was focused on explaining Microsoftâ€™s Software+Services strategy to the press and analyst masses.
