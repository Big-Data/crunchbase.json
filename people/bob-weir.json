He grew up on the Peninsula south of San Francisco, and was glued to a guitar from the time he was 14. One of his earliest influences was a local folkie named Jorma Kaukonen. He first joined in with Garcia in 1964 to form &#8220;Mother McCree&#8217;s Uptown Jug Champions,&#8221; and then was a co-founder of the Warlocks, later the Grateful Dead. As the band grew, he became the co-lead-vocalist with Garcia, and wrote a number of important songs, including &#8220;The Other One,&#8221; &#8220;Sugar Magnolia,&#8221; &#8220;Playing in the Band,&#8221; and &#8220;Throwing Stones.&#8221; He is married to the former Natascha Muenter, and they have two daughters, Momo and Chloe. His band RatDog is increasingly active.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/4277/174277v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/4277/174277v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,270],"assets/images/resized/0017/4277/174277v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
