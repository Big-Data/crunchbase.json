Oren&#8217;s vision for Eyeview began while working simultaneously on a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Film and Television as well as a BS.C in Computer Science at Tel-Aviv University. </p>\n\n<p>Oren mastered the art of storytelling through sight, sound and motion as a film major. With a focus on how computer technology could be used to change a narrative, Oren began to measure the impact of creative changes on audiences using optimization and analytics techniques, laying the groundwork for Eyeview’s core technology. </p>\n\n<p>Before Eyeview, Oren&#8217;s online experience was shaped by his role in leading the product at 888.com, an online gaming and entertainment  solutions provider that IPO&#8217;d for $1B in the London stock exchange. His experience working with brands lead him to the realization that they didn’t have the tools they needed to deliver truly powerful brand messages to large online audiences. Today, Eyeview&#8217;s technology enables both the creation and optimization of video campaigns that establish stronger connections between brands and consumers by delivering more personal stories in their marketing messages. </p>\n\n<p>Since founding Eyeview in 2007, Oren has led the company in launches of hundreds of online campaigns for leading brands such as T-Mobile, McDonalds, Verizon, Paramount, Expedia, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and more. Oren has recruited world-renowned investors such as LightSpeed, Eric Schmidt, Nauta Capital and Gemini.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/2533/32533v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[163,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/2533/32533v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[294,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/2533/32533v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Tel-Aviv University","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Film & Cinema","institution":"Tel-Aviv University","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"EyeView","permalink":"eyeview","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/8747/28747v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[245,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/8747/28747v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[245,81],"assets/images/resized/0002/8747/28747v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product","firm":{"name":"888 Holdings","permalink":"888-holdings","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0006/4734/64734v1-max-150x150.png"],[[198,134],"assets/images/resized/0006/4734/64734v1-max-250x250.png"],[[198,134],"assets/images/resized/0006/4734/64734v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.adexchanger.com/digital-tv/eyeview-personalizing-video-ads-optimizing-with-brand-metrics-says-ceo-harnevo/","title":"Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/eric-schmidt-invests-in-israeli-start-up-eyeview-localizes-video-ads-2011-4","title":"Publication"},{"external_url":"http://www.beet.tv/2012/01/eyeview-raises-52-million-for-automated-video-ads-.html","title":"Video Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.digiday.com/social/real-web-video-isn%E2%80%99t-in-banners/","title":"Blog post"},{"external_url":"http://the-makegood.com/2012/04/27/eyeview-digitals-oren-harnevo-on-enabling-new-levels-of-creativity-in-video/","title":"Profile"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.eyeviewdigital.com","title":"Company website"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/ohnevo","title":"Twitter"}]}
