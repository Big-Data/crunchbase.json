He went on to work for the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece, camping on beaches in Crete to protect nests and hatchlings. Alex accumulated extensive experience in building aquariums for his own research projects at Duke and the University of Delaware. He founded Jellyfish Art on a platform of cutting-edge jellyfish husbandry techniques that have been developed over the past decade. Alex has a B.S. from Duke in Biology and Environmental Science.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,145],"assets/images/resized/0018/8747/188747v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[110,145],"assets/images/resized/0018/8747/188747v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[110,145],"assets/images/resized/0018/8747/188747v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JellyfishArt.com</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Biology and Environmental Science","institution":"Duke University ","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & President","firm":{"name":"Jellyfish Art","permalink":"jellyfish-art","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0007/9013/79013v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0007/9013/79013v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0007/9013/79013v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"AnyVivo","permalink":"anyvivo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0018/8743/188743v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/8743/188743v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,75],"assets/images/resized/0018/8743/188743v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"JellyfishArt","permalink":"jellyfishart","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandon","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
