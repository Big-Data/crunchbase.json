He is a self-taught developer who studied design and advertising before being lured into the business of the web. At the age of 19, he co-founded Buzka, a Silicon Valley award winning technology start-up and BRW Top 100 Australian Web App which shares its secret sauce with Future Health.</p>\n\n<p>Jinnan leads product strategy, design and development across Future Health&#8217;s suite of websites and applications. His cross-disciplinary skills make him as fearless in the boardroom as the server room. He loves rolling up his sleeves with talented people to make big ideas happen and creating innovative strategies and solutions that push the boundaries. He secretly enjoys nudging, pushing and pulling the Future Health team to accomplish the impossible, which can sometimes produce mild symptoms of discomfort.</p>\n\n<p>Jinnan is passionate about innovations that empower individuals and communities to achieve a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. He has an insatiable appetite for good food and world-changing ideas, while maintaining a healthy interest in economics, sustainability, and Chinese medicine.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Buzka, Pty Ltd.","permalink":"buzka-pty-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/6510/26510v2-max-150x150.png"],[[106,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/6510/26510v2-max-250x250.png"],[[106,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/6510/26510v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Strategy Officer","firm":{"name":"Future Health","permalink":"future-health","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0006/9600/69600v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0006/9600/69600v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[257,92],"assets/images/resized/0006/9600/69600v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Strategy Officer","firm":{"name":"Popfossa","permalink":"popfossa","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0006/9730/69730v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[207,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/9730/69730v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[207,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/9730/69730v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Strategy Officer","firm":{"name":"HealthEngine","permalink":"healthengine","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0004/0043/40043v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0004/0043/40043v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,73],"assets/images/resized/0004/0043/40043v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jinnan","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/jinnan","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jinnan","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://younoodle.com/people/jinnan_cai","title":"YouNoodle"},{"external_url":"http://venturebeatprofiles.com/person/profile/jinnan-cai","title":"VentureBeat"}]}
