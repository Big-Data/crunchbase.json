He has deep experience in online marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), affiliate marketing, and high-impact public relationsâ€“ yes, he spends a LOT of time online. As a Director at Amazon.com from &#8216;98-&#8216;04, he was a driving force in the emergence of the marketplace platform (used and new product sales by third-party merchants) that grew from 0% to more than 24% of Amazonâ€™s unit sales today.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining Amazon, Dave was a CPA and consultant with Arthur Andersen LLP. Dave attended the MBA program at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and has a BS from the Pennsylvania State University.</p>\n\n<p>Daveâ€™s recently taken a motorcycle safety training class at Evergreen Safety Council in Seattle, WA (motorists in Seattle are very grateful). In the past, he&#8217;s taken evening photography classes at Seattle Central Community College and various evening HTML courses at the University of Washington. Dave has a long list of learning experiences he can&#8217;t wait to discover on TeachStreet â€“ next is to finally learn some French!</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7470/17470v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,227],"assets/images/resized/0001/7470/17470v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,227],"assets/images/resized/0001/7470/17470v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"","institution":"Pennsylvania State University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Wharton","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","firm":{"name":"TeachStreet","permalink":"teachstreet","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/7469/17469v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/7469/17469v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,145],"assets/images/resized/0001/7469/17469v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"HelpHive","permalink":"helphive","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0003/1890/31890v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0003/1890/31890v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,161],"assets/images/resized/0003/1890/31890v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Vittana","permalink":"vittana","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0007/1617/71617v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/1617/71617v2-max-250x250.png"],[[166,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/1617/71617v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Twilio","permalink":"twilio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0002/9070/29070v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/9070/29070v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9070/29070v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President Marketing","firm":{"name":"JibJab","permalink":"jibjab","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/1159/1159v6-max-150x150.png"],[[143,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/1159/1159v6-max-250x250.png"],[[143,96],"assets/images/resized/0000/1159/1159v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director Product Development","firm":{"name":"Amazon","permalink":"amazon","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,89],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,89],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.kirstenwinkler.com/kwestions-for-dave-schappel-google-algorithm-change/","title":"KWestions for Dave Schappel: Google Algorithm Change"}],"web_presences":[]}
