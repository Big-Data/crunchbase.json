Domaleski is the founder of World Energy and has been the driving force behind the Companyâ€™s vision and sales execution. Recognizing the deregulation of retail energy as a watershed moment in the economy, he was one of the first to develop a solution to address this opportunity. In 1996, Rich co-founded World Energyâ€™s predecessor, Oceanside Energy, which became one of the first aggregators to be granted a FERC tariff. Since that time, he has brought together the speed and accessibility of the Internet with a powerful transaction model to create the Companyâ€™s award-winning exchanges, successfully guiding World Energy to a leadership position in the industry.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","firm":{"name":"World Energy Solutions","permalink":"world-energy-solutions","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0015/0491/150491v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0015/0491/150491v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[271,72],"assets/images/resized/0015/0491/150491v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
