After a number of lawsuits had been filed against Mr. Mulein, it has been concluded that Mulein has been swindling money from individuals and businesses alike. Mr. Mulein claims to give away free insurance policies. In the process, he asks the client for the amount of the first yearâ€™s insurance premium as a loan, which he would repay with interest after a fixed amount of time. However, the loan is never repaid.</p>\n\n<p>One of the many swindles of Mr. Mulein has been reported where he loaned an amount of $121,693 as the first year insurance premium for three insurance policies for Edward D. Keller for $59,453, John L. Spangberg for $31,500, and Xantha Dhawan for $30,740. Mr. Mulein made partial payments of $20,000, $18,500, $10,000, and $2,500 in July 2011, August 2011, October 2011 and April 2012 respectively. </p>\n\n<p>In spite of all the frauds, Mr. Mulein still has the audacity to make a claim for bankruptcy and seek protection from the court stating that he has millions of debts but too little assets.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Graduate","subject":"Law","institution":"La Verne Law School ","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"HIDDEN VALUES LLC","permalink":"hidden-values-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ripoffreport.com/insurance-companies/jay-mulein/jay-mulein-diversified-financi-1E2EE.htm","title":"Jay Mulein"}],"web_presences":[]}
