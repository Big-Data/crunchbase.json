Growing up in Orange County in a family of software developers, Kevin came to his profession naturally. In 1997 he moved to Santa Barbara and co-founded Impossible Inc. Through Impossible Kevin has helped brands such as Adobe, Chumash Casino, FastClick, Commission Junction, Pacific Life and Smart &amp; Final launch successful products online. Concurrently as an initial investor and Executive Producer at MEDIUM Design Group, [creators of MEDIUM footwear and the Adobe Messenger Bag]*, he was responsible for managing all aspects of each project&#8217;s creative and technological development process. He acted as liaison between the creative and technology teams to insure every project ran smoothly, was completed on time, and exceeded MEDIUM&#8217;s own high standards of performance and quality. </p>\n\n<p>In 2005, Kevin helped a small team of developers position their document sharing wiki as &#8220;The Web Word Processor&#8221;. A little more than a year later Writely was snapped up by Google and ultimately grew into Google Docs.</p>\n\n<p>After the sale of MEDIUM to Lacoste in late 2006, Kevin was unsatisfied with the complacency within the creative industry and founded efficient and agile design group named New Leaders in early 2007. Since launch, New Leaders projects have been featured on Apple, 37Signals, Read/Write/Web, Cnet and many other websites. Kevin has helped New Leaders&#8217; customers launch applications such as Lookout, RightScale, Engine Yard, and Appfolio. Over a quarter billion dollars has been invested into New Leaders customers since 2007.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, New Leaders incubated Sound Stage. A Mac desktop application that allows developers to easily create stunning demos of their iPhone Apps and upload them to YouTube. The application was  the #2 Developers Tool opening day in the Mac App Store which it sells exclusively through.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/8330/18330v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/8330/18330v6-max-250x250.png"],[[300,300],"assets/images/resized/0001/8330/18330v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, Designer","firm":{"name":"RavenCo Software","permalink":"ravenco-software","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/7911/157911v2-max-150x150.png"],[[213,213],"assets/images/resized/0015/7911/157911v2-max-250x250.png"],[[213,213],"assets/images/resized/0015/7911/157911v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"New Leaders","permalink":"new-leaders","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0001/8329/18329v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0001/8329/18329v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[358,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/8329/18329v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Rightcart","permalink":"rightcart","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0009/9296/99296v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0009/9296/99296v1-max-250x250.png"],[[404,116],"assets/images/resized/0009/9296/99296v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","firm":{"name":"Appfolio","permalink":"appfolio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/2323/22323v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/2323/22323v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/2323/22323v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Interface Designer","firm":{"name":"Sound Stage for Mac","permalink":"sound-stage-for-mac","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","firm":{"name":"BioIQ","permalink":"bioiq","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/2562/22562v1-max-150x150.png"],[[183,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/2562/22562v1-max-250x250.png"],[[183,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/2562/22562v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Medium Design Group","permalink":"medium-design-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://Newleaders.com","title":"New Leaders"}]}
