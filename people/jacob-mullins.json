Before Shasta, Jacob joined Microsoft to help design and launch the BizSpark program, Microsoftâ€™s first initiative tailored specifically for early-stage startups. As US program lead, his focus was working with all constituents of the startup ecosystem, from early-stage incubators, investors, service providers, and more, to help align mutual interests for the startupâ€™s success. At the time of his leaving, BizSpark had over 35,000 members in over 100 countries. Prior to Microsoft, Jacob was the â€œbusiness guyâ€ at VentureBeat.com leading all non-editorial efforts including revenue generation, advertising relationships and strategic partnerships with companies like The New York Times and IDG. During college, Jacob co-founded a nutraceutical company with significant international operations in South Africa. As CEO, he led this startup to become a publicly traded-OTC company that manufactured and distributed three product lines: a dietary supplement, gum, and energy drink, in retail, online, and direct marketing channels.</p>\n\n<p>Jacob is the co-founder and Chairman of the Beverly Mullins Memorial Scholarship, a scholarship at UC Berkeley that offers financial assistance to non-traditional aged single parents who are defying all obstacles in the pursuit of education. Jacob has a B.A. in Political Science from Yale University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/4039/104039v2-max-150x150.png"],[[184,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/4039/104039v2-max-250x250.png"],[[211,286],"assets/images/resized/0010/4039/104039v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Brian Solis / [Bub.blicio.us] (http://http://bub.blicio.us/)</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Yale University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"The Daily Dot","permalink":"the-daily-dot","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Sr. Marketing Manager","firm":{"name":"Microsoft","permalink":"microsoft","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-150x150.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-250x250.png"],[[216,70],"assets/images/resized/0001/0926/10926v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director, Sales and Business Development","firm":{"name":"VentureBeat","permalink":"venturebeat","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0001/1625/11625v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/1625/11625v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,38],"assets/images/resized/0001/1625/11625v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2008/03/05/introducing-venturebeats-redesign-digitalmedia-and-our-core-team/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://valleywag.gawker.com/5055688/venturebeat-loses-its-lone-businessman","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.geekwire.com/2011/tech-moves-conrad-saam-departs-avvo-urbanspoon","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.statesman.com/business/first-ever-startup-week-to-spotlight-austins-emerging-1819982.html","title":"Austin Statesman | First-ever Startup Week to spotlight Austin's emerging tech businesses"},{"external_url":"http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/09/06/bostonstartups.aspx","title":"Bing Blog Community Forum"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/09/austin%E2%80%99s-capital-factory-2011-demo-day/","title":"TechCrunch | Inside Austinâ€™s Capital Factory 2011 Demo Day"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/21/shasta-ventures-closes-new-265-million-iii-fund/","title":"TechCrunch | Shasta Ventures Closes New $265 Million III Fund"},{"external_url":"http://www.bostonherald.com/business/technology/general/view/2011_0915bing_springs_into_action_microsoft_division_to_offer_helping_hand_to_area_start-ups","title":"Boston Herald | Bing springs into action to help startups"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jacob","title":""},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/jacobmullins","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.bizspark.com/Blogs/jacobmullins/default.aspx","title":"BizSpark Blog"}]}
