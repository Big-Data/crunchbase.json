Her insider&#8217;s view of the city developed at a young age: there were tours by way of chocolate (thanks, Dad!), innumerable attempts to divert the county dog catcher&#8217;s truck from its prey (thanks, Mom!), Matchbox car races on the Marquam trails and that Crazy 8s groupie phase. She ventured far for degrees in German, Italian and African Studies, but couldn&#8217;t resist the pull back for donuts at Helen Bernhard&#8217;s and steamers at Pal&#8217;s Shanty. After more than a decade doing the corporate marketing jig, Erin now amuses herself by writing marketing materials and articles for all kinds of clients. When she&#8217;s not chugging a chocolate malt shake at the Skyline Burger, she can sometimes be found behind a leash (or three) or pulling garlic mustard clumps from her garden.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[52,60],"assets/images/resized/0010/5280/105280v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[52,60],"assets/images/resized/0010/5280/105280v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[52,60],"assets/images/resized/0010/5280/105280v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Contributor","firm":{"name":"Neighborhood Notes","permalink":"neighborhood-notes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.neighborhoodnotes.com/author/Erin%20Codazzi/","title":"Neighborhood Notes Blog"}]}
