At Contact Networks, he was responsible for overall product strategy and overall technical architecture, and managed strategic relationships with Nokia, GemPlus, Comverse and other large partners. He has also advised US and Israeli high-tech startups on strategy, product roadmaps and technology architecture, and worked with Israeli venture capital firm Millennium Capital Venture as an investment advisor.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Hertzog got his start in the technology industry in the Israeli army, where he served four years as an IT department manager for the Intelligence Core. After leaving the military in 1997, he joined serial networking startup Class Data Systems as an application marketing engineer. The company was later sold to Cisco for $50 million, and Mr. Hertzog invested his windfall from the deal into his first startup, Contact Networks.</p>\n\n<p>In the rare break from spending long hours honing Metacafeâ€™s product strategy, meeting with partners and investors, or thinking about Metacafeâ€™s vision to become the highest-quality video destination site on the Internet, Mr. Hertzog plays in two bands. The accomplished musician plays bass guitarist for Israeli rock band, as well as Live Covers, which plays worldwide and has appeared on international television. He also studies psychology and practices windsurfing and snowboarding.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/8682/18682v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[210,244],"assets/images/resized/0001/8682/18682v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[210,244],"assets/images/resized/0001/8682/18682v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.dld-conference.com/2006/12/eyal_hertzog.html\" title=\"DLD Conference\" rel=\"nofollow\">DLD Conference</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chief Creative Officer","firm":{"name":"Metacafe","permalink":"metacafe","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0000/4213/4213v1-max-150x150.png"],[[215,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/4213/4213v1-max-250x250.png"],[[215,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/4213/4213v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Bojam","permalink":"bojam","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0002/4791/24791v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/4791/24791v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,70],"assets/images/resized/0002/4791/24791v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
