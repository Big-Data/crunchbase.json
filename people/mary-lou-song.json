With a background in journalism and media, she has a nose for news along with an innate desire to spread the proverbial word.  Now, she and her husband Alex Kazim, are co-Founders of Tokoni Inc, a social media company that helps people share their first-hand stories and connect through shared experiences. </p>\n\n<p>Mary Lou sees the inherent value of community, that peopleâ€™s shared wisdom and stories, in some way, can help all other community members.  As the third employee of eBay she helped grow the online community from 15,000 members to a robust global community of 20 million.  After meeting Alex, a fellow eBay employee, they came up with the idea to create a place where people share their unique personal stories in a way we once did on the front porch.  Unlike social networks on the web where people connect over shared acquaintances, Tokoni helps you connect with shared experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Tokoni.com closed to the public on June 30th, 2010.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[65,84],"assets/images/resized/0001/9171/19171v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[65,84],"assets/images/resized/0001/9171/19171v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[65,84],"assets/images/resized/0001/9171/19171v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/faculty/boa.aspx?id=62987\" title=\"Northwestern\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northwestern</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Tokoni","permalink":"tokoni","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/9172/19172v1-max-150x150.png"],[[217,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/9172/19172v1-max-250x250.png"],[[217,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/9172/19172v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"eBay","permalink":"ebay","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
