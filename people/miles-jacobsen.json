He currently is cultivating some ideas for new websites and web based companies. </p>\n\n<p>Since the age of seven Miles Jacobsen has been attending motivational seminars and been around companies such as MonaVie, ViaViente, New Vision, Pre-Paid Legal and most recently Regeneca, Inc. During his time around the aforementioned network marketing companies Miles has learned what works and what doesn&#8217;t. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your company produces the greatest product in the world. If your employees and internal works are not functioning like a well oiled machine you&#8217;re doomed.</p>\n\n<p>This being said Miles is looking to create a niche in the business world for a fun, transparent, welcoming company. Without disclosing his ideas, Miles plans to create a company that values employees their ideas and their well being over making seven figures or buying a new sport car. He would rather drive a Ford and have a happy hardworking team of employees developing an amazing product. Than drive a new sports car and have employees that dread clocking in for work. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0015/7114/157114v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,201],"assets/images/resized/0015/7114/157114v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,362],"assets/images/resized/0015/7114/157114v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Associate of Science","subject":"Computer Networking","institution":"Coleman University","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/milesjacobsen","title":"Twitter"}]}
