I must say that it is a pride to have taken part in establishing the biggest private ISP company in the Middle East today, part of The Orascom Telecom Group. I was handling the ISP connectivity division, managing a team of 45 people across Egypt when I was nominated among a team of three in 2001 to relocate in Dubai to establish the sister company MSN Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>I was promoted as the Regional Sales Manager for MSN Arabia, Hotmail &amp; MSN Messenger.

The business idea is based on the Nokia Interactive Platform being the exclusive representatives and retailer of advertising on the worldâ€™s leading Nokia handsets platform in the region.
