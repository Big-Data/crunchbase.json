In the ensuing four years, Middle East events changed forever both the politics and the economics of the global energy sector. Once in the private sector he formed a boutique insurance brokerage group to work with independent power companies. He was recruited away from the energy space by Knoll International to help re-invigorate this now well known furniture name. After the sale of Knoll to Westinghouse, he was recruited to Kenetech Corporation, the leading wind development and turbine manufacturer at the time, to help globally position this venture-backed company in anticipation of an IPO. After Kenetech and prior to joining RockPort, Hap and a partner developed, permitted and sold two 500+MW gas-fired power plants in the US, among other entrepreneurial ventures. Hap is a graduate of Colorado College with a BA in Political Science and earned an MBA from the Yale School of Management.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/6285/46285v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0004/6285/46285v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6285/46285v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Yale School of Management","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"RockPort Capital Partners","permalink":"rockport-capital-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/9373/29373v1-max-150x150.png"],[[165,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/9373/29373v1-max-250x250.png"],[[165,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/9373/29373v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
