These days, when not in the office, his exercise regimen includes high-speed chases of his three-year-old and one-year-old around the house. Occasionally he also breaks a sweat playing Guitar Hero.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/0114/20114v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,230],"assets/images/resized/0002/0114/20114v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,230],"assets/images/resized/0002/0114/20114v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://about.skype.com/executiveteam/joshsilverman/\" title=\"Skype\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skype</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"","institution":"Brown University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master of Business Administration","subject":"","institution":"Stanford Graduate School of Business","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President of the U.S. Consumer Services","firm":{"name":"American Express","permalink":"americanexpress","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,98],"assets/images/resized/0002/2002/22002v1-max-150x150.png"],[[100,98],"assets/images/resized/0002/2002/22002v1-max-250x250.png"],[[100,98],"assets/images/resized/0002/2002/22002v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Evite","permalink":"evite","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0000/1753/1753v3-max-150x150.png"],[[160,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/1753/1753v3-max-250x250.png"],[[160,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/1753/1753v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Skype","permalink":"skype","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,110],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-250x250.jpg"],[[315,139],"assets/images/resized/0000/1387/1387v12-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Shopping.com","permalink":"shopping-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/7114/27114v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/7114/27114v1-max-250x250.png"],[[374,69],"assets/images/resized/0002/7114/27114v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"eBay","permalink":"ebay","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/3625/3625v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/23/social-shopping-startup-shopsquad-lands-1-25m-in-funding-from-heavy-hitters/","source_description":"Social Shopping Startup ShopSquad Lands $1.25M In Funding From Heavy Hitters","raised_amount":1250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"ShopSquad/Ownza","permalink":"shopsquad","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0012/7163/127163v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,39],"assets/images/resized/0012/7163/127163v5-max-250x250.png"],[[299,47],"assets/images/resized/0012/7163/127163v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/sidecar/","source_description":"Hail A Fellow Human, Not A Taxi With “SideCar” – The New P2P Uber","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"SideCar, LLC","permalink":"sidecar-rideshare","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0019/7446/197446v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0019/7446/197446v1-max-250x250.png"],[[328,106],"assets/images/resized/0019/7446/197446v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
