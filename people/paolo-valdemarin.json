Through this, Paolo decided rather than build sites he would create easy-to-use, powerful tools enabling clients to build sites for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Paolo secured funding in early 1999, but the Internet Bubble explosion derailed business. Paolo bought back the technology from his investors, and in 2003 re-launched the business as Evectors Software.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next five years, Paolo continued evolving the platform, and in early 2008 launched PagesPlus, an aggregation based social media platform. With successful implementations with several clients including Mondadori, Il Sole 24 Ore and others, Evectors is now expanding its reach into new markets, including the US.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/8109/58109v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/8109/58109v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0005/8109/58109v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Evectors Software","permalink":"evectors-software","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/6050/116050v2-max-150x150.png"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/6050/116050v2-max-250x250.png"],[[356,357],"assets/images/resized/0011/6050/116050v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Product Strategy","firm":{"name":"Broadband Mechanics","permalink":"broadbandmechanics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/3274/3274v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/3274/3274v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/3274/3274v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/paolovalde","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/paolovaldemarin","title":"Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paolovalde/","title":"Flickr"},{"external_url":"http://friendfeed.com/paolo","title":"FriendFeed"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/paolovalde","title":"Facebook"}]}
