Specific duties include raising capital, structuring corporations, managing growth, creating partnerships and distribution strategies, advertising, sales, and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>Matt McLean is the founder of Nuikea, a mobile application development and mobile application review site. He also serves as COO and board member for Calcey Technologies. Matt began his career in technology in 1998 as a web manager with Nortel Networks and later as a business manager for CNET Networks. He then combined his high-tech experience with his lifelong entrepreneurial spirit to co-founded CompareNetworks in 2000. As Chief Operating Officer Matt was instrumental in raising CompareNetworksâ€™ $1,000,000 seed round despite the wariness of web-based markets in a post-bubble economy. With Mattâ€™s help, CompareNetworks grew to six vertical marketplaces. The company now generates $12 million in annual revenue. Matt played a critical role in the companyâ€™s recent raising of a $10 million in private equity financing.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[108,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9187/19187v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[146,201],"assets/images/resized/0001/9187/19187v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[146,201],"assets/images/resized/0001/9187/19187v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>mattmclean</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Process Management Consultant","firm":{"name":"Level 2 Industries","permalink":"level-2-industries","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Consultant","firm":{"name":"Calcey Technologies","permalink":"calcey-technologies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0011/2821/112821v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0011/2821/112821v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0011/2821/112821v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"COO","firm":{"name":"CompareNetworks","permalink":"comparenetworks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0001/9186/19186v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0001/9186/19186v3-max-250x250.png"],[[265,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/9186/19186v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Web Manager","firm":{"name":"Cisco","permalink":"cisco","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,73],"assets/images/resized/0001/8309/18309v6-max-150x150.png"],[[110,73],"assets/images/resized/0001/8309/18309v6-max-250x250.png"],[[110,73],"assets/images/resized/0001/8309/18309v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Business Manager","firm":{"name":"CNET Networks","permalink":"cnetnetworks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/2281/2281v1-max-150x150.png"],[[165,41],"assets/images/resized/0000/2281/2281v1-max-250x250.png"],[[165,41],"assets/images/resized/0000/2281/2281v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/myprofile?trk=hb_side_pro&goback=.vpf_55382_0_LPsm_name_*2_Matthew_McLean","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
