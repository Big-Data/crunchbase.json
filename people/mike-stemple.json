I concluded the sale of Odojo to SafetyWeb in July of 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to starting Odojo, I was credited with creating numerous companies in the physical personalization space. These physical personalization companies; SkinIt, Original Wraps, &amp; Bottle Wraps, have all become the industry leaders in their respective categories. Prior to entering the personalization space I created nReach, a mobile content distribution company, which was sold to a public company in 2004.</p>\n\n<p>When not creating companies I am a sponsored athlete who runs across the deserts of the world and a Governor Appointee to The Colorado Governors Council For Physical Fitness. </p>\n\n<p>I welcome the chance to share my knowledge of starting, growing and selling companies, and look forward to creating new relationships with talented persons in the technology/athletic space.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/2393/92393v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/2393/92393v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0009/2393/92393v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Mosoro","permalink":"mosoro","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0013/5592/135592v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0013/5592/135592v5-max-250x250.png"],[[281,53],"assets/images/resized/0013/5592/135592v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Original Wraps","permalink":"original-wraps","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder ","firm":{"name":"Odojo","permalink":"odojo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,77],"assets/images/resized/0009/2385/92385v1-max-150x150.png"],[[159,82],"assets/images/resized/0009/2385/92385v1-max-250x250.png"],[[159,82],"assets/images/resized/0009/2385/92385v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Skinit, Inc.","permalink":"skinit","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0013/8553/138553v1-max-150x150.png"],[[160,72],"assets/images/resized/0013/8553/138553v1-max-250x250.png"],[[160,72],"assets/images/resized/0013/8553/138553v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Sold Odojo","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/04/safetyweb-odojo/","source_text":null,"source_description":"SafetyWeb Acquires Odojo In Battle To Monitor The Youngsters","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Stemple","permalink":"mike-stemple"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/MikeStemple","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
