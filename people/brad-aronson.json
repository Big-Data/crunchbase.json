After the sale, I joined aQuantive’s executive team. I had a number of great roles there including one launching new businesses and services.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft purchased aQuantive in 2007. (Thank you Bill Gates.) I stayed at MSFT for a couple years running a business unit that generated small business leads in the US, UK and Canada.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I advise, invest in and serve on the Boards of startup/marketing/technology companies. I also focus time on nonprofits that serve youth. I’m a Board Member for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Southeastern PA, Board Chair of Spark the Wave, and I advise Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. I also occasionally chaperone a fabulous high school service club’s trips to build homes in El Salvador.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
