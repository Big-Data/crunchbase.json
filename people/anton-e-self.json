He built the companyâ€™s original team, directed corporate strategy and key operating functions, raised millions of dollars in funding, and oversaw the first services launch.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Self also founded and managed Telephant, a data communications infrastructure company based in New York. At Telephant in the â€˜90s, he dug up miles of New York City streets between Wall St. and Midtown, laid conduits of optical fiber, and sold access on this network. The area of lower Manhattan this fiber touched became during the dot-com boom known as Silicon Alley. He later negotiated building rooftop rights and built a wireless network primarily in the 38 GHz spectrum. Telephant sold access on this â€œwireless fiberâ€ in partnerships with its license holders, providing third-tier broadband redundancy between front offices and data centers of Fortune 500 companies, Wall Street firms, and government agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Self learned his craft in broadband applications infrastructure in the telecom growth era of the â€˜90s, selling competitive local exchange and carrier class services at Metropolitan Fiber Systems and MCI Communications (both now Verizon/MCI). In order to win one particularly large contract while at MFS, Mr. Self invented, sold and deployed the worldâ€™s first city-wide CENTREX application, Intellitrex - now used widely by metropolitan carriers with centralized switches.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Self studied Corporate Finance and International Portfolio Management at the London School of Economics, and Humanities at the University of Arizona.</p>\n\n<p>He is an avid ocean sailor. In 2003 he raced the 20-meter 1935 Herreshoff wooden schooner Mistral from Rhode Island to Cuxhaven, Germany, in the DaimlerChrysler North Atlantic Challenge. He has sailed a passage from Florida to California and cruised the waters of Thailandâ€™s Andaman Sea, among other such adventures.</p>\n\n<p>In his spare time he helped manage three political campaigns, including a component of Rudolf Giulianiâ€™s first successful New York City mayoral bid.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,97],"assets/images/resized/0006/9984/69984v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[245,160],"assets/images/resized/0006/9984/69984v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[245,160],"assets/images/resized/0006/9984/69984v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>JASON MALLOY (The Truro Daily News)</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"BastionHost","permalink":"bastionhost","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0006/8924/68924v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,125],"assets/images/resized/0006/8924/68924v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,225],"assets/images/resized/0006/8924/68924v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
