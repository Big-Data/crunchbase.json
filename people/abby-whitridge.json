During the two years she was there, she grew her book of business from zero to $8 million in annual revenues and $4 million in profit. The company was then sold to Intermix and MySpace. Abby then moved over to Hydra Network during its beginning stages to help manage affiliates, while simultaneously catering to her passion for cooking by attending culinary school. Once she finished school and decided a career in cooking wasnâ€™t for her, she joined Hydra full time running its affiliate network. She was later promoted to VP of the network where she oversaw both sales and publisher operations during the companyâ€™s best years. In 2009, she resigned from Hydra, and then co-founded W4. Abby has a B.S. in Advertising from the University of Coloradoâ€™s Journalism School. Her interests are skiing, cooking, traveling and enjoying life. She lives in Venice, CA with her husband and her two dogs, Cooper and Annie.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[92,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/0457/150457v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[92,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/0457/150457v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[92,112],"assets/images/resized/0015/0457/150457v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Advertising","institution":"University of Coloradoâ€™s Journalism School","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, COO","firm":{"name":"W4","permalink":"w4","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,119],"assets/images/resized/0007/5593/75593v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[154,123],"assets/images/resized/0007/5593/75593v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[154,123],"assets/images/resized/0007/5593/75593v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
