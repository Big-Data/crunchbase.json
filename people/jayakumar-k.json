Actively participated in defining/improving software Modeling standards, Configuration Management/ Change Control Management, Testing process and procedures at enterprise level. Hands on exposure in CMM documentation and ISO documentation at Architecture level. I have acquired sufficient exposure in Software Auditing and QMS implementation based on ISO 9000:2001 against 19011 and ISO 12207 establishes a process of life cycle for software, including processes and activities applied during the acquisition and configuration of the services of the system.\nI provide a traditional approach to Software Engineering services, founded with fundamental Software Engineering principles developed over the past several decades within the field of Computer Science. I am able to minimize the software development process provided the risks are thoroughly understood. \nI take pride in my ability to learn new skills or technologies. I hold with conviction the belief that the greatest benefit of higher education is the proven ability to learn, to have â€œlearned how to learn.â€ As a solution provider and professional, I am the type of person who spends a substantial amount of my free time in study and research.
