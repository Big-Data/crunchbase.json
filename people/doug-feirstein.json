His passion for entrepreneurship is not just about personally starting innovative, disruptive businesses â€“ something he has done for many years. Dougâ€™s unique strand of entrepreneurial DNA is driven by the core belief that making customers happy will be the best catalyst for a hugely successful business. Unlike many entrepreneurs who are driven by money and/or ego, Dougâ€™s crusade is keenly focused on setting a previously unimaginable standard for customer satisfaction. \nToday, Doug is the Co-Founder and CEO of Upstream Worldwide. Upstream is the leading cash commerce platform, specializing in purchasing goods directly from consumers in exchange for cash. Upstream&#8217;s portfolio internet companies include uSell and Dollars4Gold. At uSell, Doug has launched the â€œ100% Max Cash Guaranteeâ€ which ensures you get the most cash or weâ€™ll pay the difference. It is a simple yet Herculean approach to servicing customers. In addition to his max cash-driven vision, Doug believes in building business eco-systems by carefully layering in the right teams, partners, and leaders to create self-sustaining companies that grow and adapt to the worldâ€™s needs.</p>\n\n<p>Doug started his entrepreneurial adventure in the direct marketing and catalog industries, gaining experience in both operations and marketing. After consulting for a DRTV media company, he developed the idea to disrupt the traditional call center by utilizing the untapped work-at-home community to answer calls from home rather than the traditional on-site call center. Starting from his garage, Doug launched LiveOps and pioneered the movement towards home-shoring. Fast-forward 10 years years later, LiveOps.com is now a thriving company, with over $150mm in revenue and 20,000+ agents working from home all over the country. LiveOps.com has since been backed by Menlo Ventures, Benchmark Capital, CMEA Ventures and August Capital.\nDougâ€™s insatiable entrepreneurial appetite is also fueled by an intense need to help bring entrepreneursâ€™ ideas to life by funding their ventures. To achieve this, Doug has formed his own personal angel investment fund to help infuse new entrepreneurs with much needed capital. Since starting the fund, Doug has had the opportunity to invest and be involved with many early stage companies including:<br/>\nâ€¢ Mojiva - A mobile ad platform that is quickly becoming a leader in the space and has been since backed by Bertlesman.\nâ€¢ Nutrabella - A retail food company in the natural food space that provides pre-natal nutrition to pregnant women around the world.\nâ€¢ Ignighter â€“ An innovative dating site that allows groups of people to connect and set up dates in a safe, group environment. They have since received a significant investment from the founder of Ameritrade.\nDoug has always believed that building a business is an endurance event. In this spirit, Doug has completed two 1/2 Ironman triathlons and several marathons. \nDoug holds a BS in Finance from the University of Florida, and is a member and of the South Florida Entrepreneurs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/0574/150574v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/0574/150574v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0015/0574/150574v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
