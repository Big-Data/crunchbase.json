He also currently serves as board observer at RockTech, a Rockefeller Consulting Company, and is enrolled in the Harvard Owner/President Management Program.</p>\n\n<p>A dual-major bachelor of science graduate of US Military Academy at West Point, Adrian started off analyzing macroeconomic trends at Economy.com (later acquired by Moody&#8217;s). There, he met his future business partners Jagath Wanninayake and Graham Wert, and together they started Clarix, an informatics company that delivered next-generation clinical trial logistics and management solutions for the pharmaceutical research and development industry. By employing a proprietary architecture, which unified the development of phone and web applications, Clarix enabled their clients to commence clinical trials in as little as half the time it took their competitors. The technological leadership was recognized by the partnerships developed with Covance and Aptuit, two large businesses in that market, and ultimately, by the acquisition of the company by Phase Forward, itself later acquired by Oracle. In his role as Chief Technologist, IRT Products Group, Adrian helped drive the integration of Clarix products into the Phase Forward suite of solutions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2322/152322v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[243,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/2322/152322v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[438,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/2322/152322v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Economics, International Relations","institution":"US Military Academy","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Observer","firm":{"name":"RockTech","permalink":"rocktech","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0015/6252/156252v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0015/6252/156252v2-max-250x250.png"],[[273,54],"assets/images/resized/0015/6252/156252v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technologist, IRT Products Group","firm":{"name":"Phase Forward","permalink":"phase-forward","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,13],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,23],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-250x250.png"],[[260,24],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","firm":{"name":"Clarix Technologies","permalink":"clarix-technologies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0020/4371/204371v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[183,67],"assets/images/resized/0020/4371/204371v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[183,67],"assets/images/resized/0020/4371/204371v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantalapan","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
