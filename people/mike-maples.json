Before becoming a full-time investor, Mike was an entrepreneur and operating executive who worked in a variety of senior management roles in high-growth companies. His background spans a variety of markets including consumer technology, small business, and the enterprise, and he has led various functions in product development, marketing, business development, and corporate strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Mike began his technology career in high school, when he started a software company that developed games and educational products for the original IBM PC. He has been passionate about the technology industry ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Before founding Maples Investments, Mike co-founded Motive, Inc., the world&#8217;s leading broadband software company in 1997, and played key roles in its growth from raw start-up through sales of more than $75 million. Motive was one of the only successful technology IPOs in 2004, and the most successful infrastructure software IPO for the prior three years. At Motive, Mike was General Manager of Motive&#8217;s Corporate Business Unit, as well as Chief Marketing and Strategy officer.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Motive, Mike was responsible for worldwide product marketing at Tivoli Systems, where he managed the company&#8217;s product portfolio from its early-stage development through its 1995 IPO and growth to a $750M line of business within the IBM Software Group. Mike began his professional career at Silicon Graphics, where he served in business development and product marketing roles.</p>\n\n<p>In his spare time Mike is an amateur artist, movie-maker, and calligrapher. He holds an Engineering degree from Stanford University, an MBA from Harvard Business School, and is a frequent speaker at industry conferences and a guest-lecturer on entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, Stanford University, Princeton University, and the University of Texas.</p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://www.maplesinvestments.com/maples.html\" title=\"Maples Investments\"
