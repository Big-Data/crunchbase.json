D. is considered one of the leading scientists in the world. He is currently Chief Scientific Officer at Advanced Cell Technology, and Adjunct Professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. He has hundreds of publications and inventions, and over two dozen scientific books: among them, â€œPrinciples of Tissue Engineering,â€ which is recognized as the definitive reference in the field. Others include One World: The Health &amp; Survival of the Human Species in the 21st Century (Foreword by former President and Nobel laureate Jimmy Carter), and the â€œHandbook of Stem Cellsâ€ and â€œEssentials of Stem Cell Biology,â€ which are considered the definitive references in stem cell research. </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Lanza and his research have been featured in almost every media outlet in the world, including CNN, TIME, Newsweek, People, as well as the front pages of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, among others. Lanza has worked with some of the greatest thinkers of our time, including Nobel laureates Gerald Edelman and Rodney Porter, renowned Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner (the â€œFather of modern behaviorismâ€), Jonas Salk (discoverer of the Polio vaccine), and heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard. His current research and work at Advanced Cell Technology focuses on stem cells and regenerative medicine and their potential to provide therapies for some of the worldâ€™s most deadly and debilitating conditions.\nIn 2007, Lanza published a feature article, â€œA New Theory of the Universeâ€ in The American Scholar, a leading intellectual journal which has previously published works by Albert Einstein, Margaret Mead, and Carl Sagan, among others. His theory places biology above the other sciences in an attempt to solve one of natureâ€™s biggest puzzles, the theory of everything that other disciplines have been pursuing for the last century. This new view has become known as Biocentrism.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3406/103406v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3406/103406v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3406/103406v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Doctorate","subject":"","institution":"University of Pennsylvania","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientific Officer","firm":{"name":"Advanced Cell Technology","permalink":"advanced-cell-technology","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0006/8772/68772v2-max-150x150.png"],[[226,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/8772/68772v2-max-250x250.png"],[[226,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/8772/68772v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.robertlanza.com","title":"Robert Lanza's Homepage"},{"external_url":"http://www.advancedcell.com","title":"Advanced Cell Technology"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/robertlanza","title":"Robert Lanza's Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-lanza/25/677/b11","title":"Robert Lanza's LinkedIn"}]}
