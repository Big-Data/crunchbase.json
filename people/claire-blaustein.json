Having studied the instrument since the age of 4, sheâ€™s played in orchestras, chamber groups and summer festivals such as Interlochen and Meadowmount.</p>\n\n<p>She kept it going with a degree in Violin Performance from Indiana University-Bloomington. She then turned to the dark side by getting her Masters in Music Criticism from McMaster University in Ontario. A former writer for NPRâ€™s â€œPerformance Today,â€ Claire writes music criticism for publications such as NPR.orgâ€™s Song of the Day, The Washington Post, The Music Scene and Exclaim! Magazine. She was a recent runner-up for the BBC Music Magazineâ€™s Michael Oliver Memorial Award.</p>\n\n<p>Claire learned to cook by playing sous-chef to a large family of Italian food-lovers, and then by feeding hordes of hungry roommates. She now lives in Washington D.C., where she spends her time seeking out other peopleâ€™s kitchens to cook in.
