He also was vocal in calling for what is embodied now in the ALT.NET movement (although he is not apparently connected to it).</p>\n\n<p>Most notably was his role as CTO at Monetaire, a global and commerical software framework provider in financial services, delivering one of the first large-scale SOA driven frameworks in .NET at that time. Various articles and industry analysts have written about his experiences and leadership there (add links..). </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Monetaire was named a top three innovator in Europe by Forrester research - (year?)</p>\n\n<p>Many describe Mr. Carr as having &#8216;boundless enegergy and passion&#8217; and being &#8216;very hands-on in code&#8217; with advanced software engineering technologies. </p>\n\n<p>He tends to appear on lists of leading authorities in agile as well as the emerging field of Software Factories (with a book due in 2006 on the intersection of Agile process and Factories canned tentatively &#8216;Agile Software Factories&#8217;).</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Carr has more than 16 years of progressive experience in managing and contributing to large-scale, mission-critical software initiatives. His extensive experience and knowledge in various Financial Services areas, with additional experience in Broadcast Media and other key industries make him more effective in applying technology and aligning the technology with the business. He is also extremely versed in international development and business operations and have a heavy focus on leading innovations in software engineering such as Design Patterns and Agile Processes.He leads two user groups which are each the largest of their kind in the world: The C# Design Patterns Experts Group and the Software Factories Group. The International Dot Net Association (INETA) has recognized two of his groups with their acceptance.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Computer Science, Finance, IS","institution":"California State University, Sacramento","graduated_year":1993,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Monetaire","permalink":"monetaire","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Software Development","firm":{"name":"agilefactor","permalink":"agilefactor","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0010/7295/107295v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[203,43],"assets/images/resized/0010/7295/107295v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[203,43],"assets/images/resized/0010/7295/107295v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://using.castleproject.org/display/~dcarr/Home+for+Damon+Wilder+Carr+-+team+domain.dot.net","title":"Castle Open Source .NET Innovators Membership"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/damoncarr","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
