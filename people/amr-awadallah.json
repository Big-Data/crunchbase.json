Amr came to the US in Oct&#8217;95 to join the Stanford EE PhD program working on Internet protocols and network switching with Prof. Fouad Tobagi then Prof. Nick Mckeown. In June 1999 he took a leave of absence from the Stanford PhD program and started VivaSmart (aka Aptivia) with Thai Tran, the company built a content management system for online comparison shopping. In June 2000 Yahoo! acquired VivaSmart for $9M. Amr joined Yahoo! as a software engineering manager with that acquisition and managed the integration of the technology into Yahoo! Shopping. In 2001, Amr re-joined the Stanford PhD program with Prof. Mendel Rosenblum (while continuing to work at Yahoo). Amr received his PhD in EE from Stanford in June 2007, the thesis was about building a world wide network of virtual machine monitors to make Internet services more scalable, reliable, and interactive. In late 2002 Amr was tasked with creating a business intelligence group for Yahoo Search, the goal was to make a science out of optimizing the yahoo search user experience and balance that with monetization needs. By 2007 the group grew to about 60 engineers spanning all of Yahoo&#8217;s user facing products (mail, search, finance, news, etc) and Amr was promoted to Vice President of engineering of that team. Amr is currently an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Accel Partners looking to start a new company in the cloud computing space.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[118,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6429/26429v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[196,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/6429/26429v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[354,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/6429/26429v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"EE","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Cloudera","permalink":"cloudera","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/6684/26684v7-max-150x150.png"],[[116,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/6684/26684v7-max-250x250.png"],[[116,22],"assets/images/resized/0002/6684/26684v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Entreprenuer In Residence","firm":{"name":"Accel Partners","permalink":"accel-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,162],"assets/images/resized/0001/0604/10604v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"vufind","permalink":"vufind","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0002/3775/23775v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0002/3775/23775v3-max-250x250.png"],[[319,83],"assets/images/resized/0002/3775/23775v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"VivaSmart","permalink":"vivasmart","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0002/3541/23541v2-max-150x150.png"],[[190,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3541/23541v2-max-250x250.png"],[[190,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3541/23541v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Engineering","firm":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0901/072_print.html","title":"Purple People"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/awadallah","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/awadallah/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/awadallah","title":""},{"external_url":"http://delicious.com/awadallah","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/awadallah","title":""}]}
