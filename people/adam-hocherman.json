That product led to a line of alarm clocks, then kitchen cooking timers and most recently the successful Onaroo line of â€œSmart products for children and their parents.â€  Nearly seven years later, Hocherman has built a network of overseas manufacturing partners located primarily in Shenzhen, China and has become a resource to seasoned product designers and budding entrepreneurs alike, who are interested in the development of mass produced consumer electronic items.  He recently authored a three-part series for &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.crunchgear.com&gt;CrunchGear&lt;/A&gt; titled, â€œ&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/10/going-it-alone-how-to-make-your-stuff-in-china/&quot;&gt;Going It Alone: How To Make Your Stuff In China&lt;/A&gt;.â€  He is a patriot, a small business owner and an advocate of how Chinese and American entrepreneurs can work together for the greater good of both countries in the new global economy.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,107],"assets/images/resized/0008/7430/87430v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,179],"assets/images/resized/0008/7430/87430v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,322],"assets/images/resized/0008/7430/87430v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering","institution":"Cornell University","graduated_year":1997,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Business","institution":"Cornell University","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.americaninnovative.com","title":"American Innovative Homepage"},{"external_url":"http://www.designtheatre.net","title":"DesignTheatre.net (BLOG)"}]}
