Equally comfortable with new biz development/creative pitches as well as managing clients and driving campaigns to completion while nurturing long-term relationships. A “social animal” who thrives within any agency environment, Justice can conceptualize independently or nourish collaborative teams. There are lots of extras, too – excellent public speaker, trend hunter, social community director, award-winning photographer and active user/strategist of the latest social media and communication technologies. Culminating with progressive management skills, record of high team productivity and long list of satisfied, repeat clients.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BFA","subject":"illustration","institution":"Ringling College of Art & Design","graduated_year":1993,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/justicemitchell","title":"LinkedIN"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/JusticeMitchell/sets/","title":"Flickr"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/JusticeMitchell","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/JusticeMitchell","title":"YouTube"},{"external_url":"http://www.ted.com/profiles/view/id/594050","title":"TED"},{"external_url":"https://foursquare.com/justicemitchell","title":"Foursquare"},{"external_url":"http://www.slideshare.net/JusticeMitchell","title":"Slideshare"},{"external_url":"http://www.quora.com/Justice-Mitchell","title":"Quora"},{"external_url":"http://socialmediaclub.org/profile/justicemitchell","title":"Social Media Club"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107191272445079896458/107191272445079896458/posts","title":"Google+"}]}
