The Treasure Island Flea is a once a month outdoor market featuring hundreds of local vendors and is host to dozens of the Bay Area&#8217;s best food trucks. The mission for the Treasure Island Flea is to be an affordable platform for local entrepreneurs to showcase their goods and services to their local customers. The Treasure Island Flea continues to attract an average of 10,000 customers a month and is held the last weekend of every month.</p>\n\n<p>Charlie&#8217;s latest venture, ParkPlease.com, aims to solve the parking crisis in urban and dense areas. It is a peer to peer marketplace where neighbors can rent out their idle parking spots to commuters in need. The service is set to launch in August 2012 for the Outside Lands Concert in San Francisco. ParkPlease already has hundreds of parking spaces signed up for the service&#8217;s launch. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/7471/197471v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/7471/197471v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/7471/197471v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"ParkPlease","permalink":"parkplease","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0019/7478/197478v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0019/7478/197478v2-max-250x250.png"],[[381,110],"assets/images/resized/0019/7478/197478v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"ParkPlease.com","permalink":"parkplease-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, Organizer","firm":{"name":"Treasure Island Flea","permalink":"treasure-island-flea","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://about.me/CharlieAnsanelli","title":""},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/charlie.ansanelli","title":""},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/cansanelli","title":""}]}
