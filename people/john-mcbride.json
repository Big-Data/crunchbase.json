His entrepreneurial spirit and vision has allowed him to create several successful businesses, including a frozen yogurt store in the early 1980’s and a chain of 7 video game / movie rental stores under the name of Player’s Choice in the early 1990’s. As the chain of stores increased, Mr. McBride added a franchise component (20 stores) to this business model in early 2001. From its inception, John has been the visionary leader behind the concepts and ideas that make SnapCrowd what it is today. John is currently also the company’s sole salesperson and business development officer.
