Chris Says &#8220;Awarding Carbon Credits is a great way to make consumers aware of the environmental impact of e-waste and to upgrade gadgets responsibly.&#8221; When trade-in customers reach a certain negative carbon footprint total they can trade in their Credits for a $50 bonus.</p>\n\n<p>Chris has kept his business growing organically at a steady pace, but is now looking to go down the same route of other competitors in the field who are now majority funded by VC. Chris &#8220;I find it quite encouraging that with so many highly funded outfits in the market place now, we are slowly but surely creeping into the first search page on a number of our keywords. business is really taking off as a result.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0014/9217/149217v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0014/9217/149217v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,215],"assets/images/resized/0014/9217/149217v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>trade2save</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"2.2","subject":"Ancient History","institution":"University of Reading, UK","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.trade2save.com","title":""}]}
