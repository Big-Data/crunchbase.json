He founded Cordys in 2001, together with Theodoor van Donge; the key architect behind Baan Company&#8217;s pioneering ERP solution.</p>\n\n<p>The progressive nature of the Cordys technology is strongly reflective of Jan&#8217;s cumulative experience in software innovation and creation. Jan&#8217;s mission with Cordys is to solve the IT implementation and change issues faced by today&#8217;s extended enterprise by enabling an organization to be more responsive to\nchanging business conditions. </p>\n\n<p>Cordys is unique in that it has designed a platform to bridge four, seemingly disconnected, worlds: Business Process Management, Integration, Composite Application development, and the Cloud. This unique combination not only compliments  existing enterprise software but also adds agility to business operations by delivering process-centric solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Jan founded Baan Company in 1978, soon after attending Business College. With the development of his first software package in 1979, Jan started what was to become a pioneering career in the ERP industry. Under Jan&#8217;s stewardship, Baan Company grew from a $35 million company in the early 1990s to $680 million in 1998.</p>\n\n<p>In the late 1990s, Jan became a highly successful venture capitalist by focusing on software innovation. He was an early investor in the on-demand collaborative software company WebEx Communications, recently acquired by Cisco Systems for $3 billion, as well as an early backer of Top Tier, which was subsequently sold to SAP for $400 million.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0008/6695/86695v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0008/6695/86695v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,143],"assets/images/resized/0008/6695/86695v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chairman, Chief Innovation Officer","firm":{"name":"Cordys","permalink":"cordys-software","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0007/6044/76044v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/6044/76044v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,76],"assets/images/resized/0007/6044/76044v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/tuXKF6hnuVo&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/tuXKF6hnuVo&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Jan Baan speaks in a TV interview with Business IQ, SA on entrepreneurship.</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/corporate-dossier/The-day-you-stop-dreaming-you-die-as-an-entrepreneur/articleshow/5674193.cms","title":"ET Interview: 'The day you stop dreaming, you die as an entrepreneur'"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://nl.linkedin.com/pub/jan-baan/10/a48/803","title":"Jan's LinkedIn Profile"}]}
