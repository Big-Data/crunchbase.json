Random Thoughts was one of the first companies to produce high budget, multi-part mobile and online TV series for clients in the Irish market. Random Thoughts worked with clients and brands, including Telefonica, Hutchinson 3G, eircom, Leinster Rugby, Diageo and many more. </p>\n\n<p>In 2010, he co-founded URBN - a digital media company in Dubai. URBN is focused on delivering high quality content for clients in a range of industries. They work with a number of airlines, Government agencies, retail outlets and brands in Europe and the MENA region. In 2011, his stake in that company was acquired. </p>\n\n<p>He previously worked on Farmvillain - an app based largely around nonsense and mischief. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the po-faced nature of much of social media, it was a massive success. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/7068/87068v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[161,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/7068/87068v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[211,327],"assets/images/resized/0008/7068/87068v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Journalism and Media Communications","institution":"Griffith College Dublin","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Mr. EMEA","firm":{"name":"Kiip","permalink":"kiip","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/5908/95908v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/5908/95908v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/5908/95908v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"URBN","permalink":"urbn","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CMO","firm":{"name":"Silly Goose","permalink":"silly-goose","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/eamonncarey","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://ie.linkedin.com/in/ecarey","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/eamonncarey","title":"Facebook"}]}
