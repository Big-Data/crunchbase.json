Previously, he worked as the Senior Vice President of the Systems Management Business at Legent Corporation, where he was responsible for all of Legent&#8217;s Systems Management products (which constituted over 90% of Legent&#8217;s $500M+ in revenue) and thus led over one thousand marketing, product managers, project managers, and software developers in the United States and Europe. Mark left Legent after successfully helping steer the company in its acquisition by Computer Associates.\nBefore joining Legent, Mark was a vice president at NCR Corporation where he had profit and loss responsibility for its $1.5B+ server business.
