Misunderstood by some, the truth is his sense of humor is not encrypted, itâ€™s just elaborate and his tendency to forget objects at other peopleâ€™s office is only a technique to test their attention level.</p>\n\n<p>While working at Crea | SX Networks, Gabriel has been involved in projects with clients such as The Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., Conviva, IamFootball.com, Panda Software, Bacardi, Wamba.com, Hispavista, Bingos.com, Bingos.co.uk, MediaGambling, ElGranBingo.com, Mambo.ca, HealthCare.com, among others. Currently, Crea| SX Networks and its group of talented professionals are focused on projects that involve hosting, development, design, consulting, marketing and customer support. </p>\n\n<p>At night he spends his hard earned money making writing, producing and making music with a bunch of friends in yet another band called  <a href=\"http://www.cuatrocuartos.com\" title=\"Cuatro Cuartos\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cuatro Cuartos</a>. He&#8217;s neither a writer, a musician nor music producer, which is exactly what makes him so good doing those things. He is specially NOT an artist&#8230; well, perhaps just a skilled artisan.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","firm":{"name":"Crea","permalink":"crea","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,111],"assets/images/resized/0003/5544/35544v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,185],"assets/images/resized/0003/5544/35544v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,333],"assets/images/resized/0003/5544/35544v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.gabrielsimonet.com","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.cuatrocuartos.com","title":"Cuatro Cuartos"},{"external_url":"http://www.maquetitas.com","title":"Weblog Musical"},{"external_url":"http://www.intertenimiento.com","title":"Marketing Online de PelÃ­culas de Cine"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.es/gabriel.simonet.uy","title":"Gabriel Simonet on Facebook"}]}
