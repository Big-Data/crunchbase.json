In each, he has been uniquely successful in creating value, whether measured in lives saved (Fortune magazine called him &#8220;The Man Who Changed Medicine&#8221;), students inspired or jobs created. Between 1969 and 1989, he financed more than 3,200 companies that collectively created millions of jobs. His philanthropy, which began in the 1970s and paralleled his business career, expanded in 1982 with the establishment of the Milken Family Foundation. He also heads the Prostate Cancer Foundation and FasterCures, a Washington-based think tank that removes barriers to progress against all life-threatening diseases. Mike joined leading physicians in launching the Melanoma Research Alliance to support work on fatal skin cancers. He is chairman of the widely respected and influential Milken Institute, an economic think tank whose annual Global Conference brings more than 3,000 leaders from 60 nations to Los Angeles each spring. Mike graduated from Berkeley with highest honors and earned his MBA at the Wharton School. He and his wife, Lori, have three children and four grandchildren and celebrated their 41st anniversary this year.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/7356/67356v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/7356/67356v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,284],"assets/images/resized/0006/7356/67356v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Wikipedia</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"company":{"name":"Bizmore","permalink":"bizmore","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/3064/53064v2-max-150x150.png"],[[143,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/3064/53064v2-max-250x250.png"],[[143,57],"assets/images/resized/0005/3064/53064v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.mikemilken.com/","title":""}]}
