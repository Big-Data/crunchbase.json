He grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and grew up some more in Boston where he finished MIT with a degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. A strong-willed competitive swimmer for 12 years, he once held his breath so long he suffered the loss of his speech for 15 seconds following. He was the Checkers Master of Harvard Square, a would-be character study for Roger Donaldsonâ€™s 2003 film, The Recruit, and a pretty good roommate. Erdem relocated in 2004 to join a large Chicago-based hedge fund where he researched and invested in many great companies before starting his own in 2010.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,113],"assets/images/resized/0014/6910/146910v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0014/6910/146910v1-max-250x250.png"],[[264,199],"assets/images/resized/0014/6910/146910v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"OpenChime","permalink":"openchime","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0013/7342/137342v1-max-150x150.png"],[[236,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/7342/137342v1-max-250x250.png"],[[236,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/7342/137342v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
