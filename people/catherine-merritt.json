As a communicator my whole life (my first words at nine months were â€œhi, thereâ€), I bring forth passion to reach people through many outlets and channels. As a social media strategist and account supervisor with Ketchum, I specialize in community and social engagement. Whether itâ€™s building online communities for clients, creating highly engaged content to bring that community to life or reaching people through traditional tactics, I thrive on connecting people to brands and leveraging them to share it throughout their own networks. </p>\n\n<p>I believe in order to offer social media and digital services, you should be doing it on your own. I&#8217;ve been known to share a thought or two on Twitter, network on LinkedIn, connect with friends on Facebook and document my passion for food, wine and cooking on a little blog called The Chicago Foodie. </p>\n\n<p>But this is, of course, only part of who I am. </p>\n\n<p>I am also an innovator, inventor, entrepreneur, blogger, wife and mother. So yeah. Thatâ€™s a little snapshot into who Catherine Merritt is. But you know the best way to really find out?
