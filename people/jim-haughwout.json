He is currently the Vice President of Commercialisation &amp; Operations at Cmed Technology Ltd. At Cmed, he leads strategy, marketing, sales and operations for Cmed&#8217;s cloud, mobile and tablet computing-based Timaeus platform. Haughwout also writes the Lagrangian Points blog and is a Managing Partner at Oulixeus Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Formerly, Haughwout was Chief Information Officer &amp; Vice President of Technology at INgage Networks (f/k/a Neighborhood America). At INgage, he led the product strategy, commercial development, delivery, operation and support of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based white label social media products for Fortune-1000, public sector and not-for-profit enterprises. Haughwout also advanced the market definitions and commercialization of the Social Networking Business Software, Social Analytics and Private Cloud Computing models. His work is a case study in IBMâ€™s 2009 Business of IT book, â€œHow to Improve Service and Lower Costs.â€</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining INgage, Haughwout held leadership roles in both Amgenâ€™s Information Systems and Research &amp; Development divisions. First, Haughwout built Amgenâ€™s enterprise program office responsible for leading delivery of large-scale enterprise technology initiatives. He then led R&amp;Dâ€™s 200-person, global business transformation program responsible for combining Enterprise 2.0 technologies (for collaboration, biomedical sciences, clinical operations, safety, medical writing and regulatory publishing) with Lean process development to reduce the time and effort to move new therapeutic products from clinical trial closeout to market application across a 39-country regulated marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Haughwout spent nearly eight years at AOL in numerous leadership roles across AOLâ€™s Marketing and Technology divisions. As Technology Director of Architecture &amp; Core Systems (AOL&#8217;s business technology product incubation lab), Haughwout chaired AOLâ€™s architecture council (the LEGO Group) and owned the worldwide services for identity management; customer relationship management; behavioral decision automation; up-sell and cross-sell; and automation of affiliate, affinity and direct response marketing campaigns. He integrated these services into a brand-wide platform (OnTargetâ„¢) to personalize promotions and fulfillment campaigns to 120 million subscribers across 30+ Time Warner brands.</p>\n\n<p>As Chief Architect for AOLâ€™s Marketing &amp; Member Development organization, he defined the strategic road map and led evaluation and integration of all major technologies for 34 call centers across 17 countries. Haughwout invented (patent WO/2002/025909) and commercialized Smart Transferâ„¢, one of AOLâ€™s first behavioral-targeting platforms. He also managed AOLâ€™s Global Customer Care Year-2000 Program, supervising the transition of 30 million customers across 14 time zones (one of only two global technology events monitored in real time by the late Peter Jennings and ABCâ€™s â€œWorld News Tonightâ€).</p>\n\n<p>The majority of Haughwoutâ€™s career prior to AOL focused on the public sector. At Booz | Allen | Hamilton, he re-engineered the technologies and operations of agencies within the US Departments of Defense, Treasury and Commerce. This included helping move the Internet Registrar industry to from National Science Foundation custodianship to an open market model. At Lockheed Martinâ€™s Management &amp; Data Systems division, Haughwout delivered systems integration services to public and private clients across North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. In this role, he routinely briefed senior military and civilian leaders on the adoption of new communications technologies. Prior to this, he worked on the Strategic Defense Initiative at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.</p>\n\n<p>Haughwout is a member of the Business Architects Association, Industry Advisory Council, International Association of Software Architects and the Lean Enterprise Institute.. He is formerly a Member of the Advisory Boards for the Departments of Computer Science (Whitaker School of Engineering) and Computer Information Systems (Lutgert College of Business) at Florida Gulf Coast University. </p>\n\n<p>Haughwout earned a master in public policy from Harvard University and a bachelors of science in aeronautical and astronautical engineering at MIT. He has engaged in additional studies at MITâ€™s Sloan School of Management and Harvardâ€™s Business and Law Schools. He currently splits his time between the New York City and London metropolitan areas.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,147],"assets/images/resized/0003/3607/33607v6-max-150x150.png"],[[144,147],"assets/images/resized/0003/3607/33607v6-max-250x250.png"],[[144,147],"assets/images/resized/0003/3607/33607v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Bill Coletti</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors of Science","subject":"Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering","institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Master in Public Policy","subject":"Business & Government Policy, General Management","institution":"Harvard University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President of Commercialisation & Operations","firm":{"name":"Cmed Technology","permalink":"cmed-technology","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0008/6478/86478v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/6478/86478v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,65],"assets/images/resized/0008/6478/86478v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"Oulixeus Ltd","permalink":"oulixeus-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0006/1022/61022v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0006/1022/61022v2-max-250x250.png"],[[389,93],"assets/images/resized/0006/1022/61022v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CIO & Vice President of Technology","firm":{"name":"INgage Networks","permalink":"ingage-networks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0000/4189/4189v10-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0000/4189/4189v10-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,167],"assets/images/resized/0000/4189/4189v10-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Amgen","permalink":"amgen","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/9904/59904v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[97,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/9904/59904v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[97,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/9904/59904v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Lockheed Martin","permalink":"lockheed-martin","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/3883/23883v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/3883/23883v2-max-250x250.png"],[[264,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/3883/23883v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Booz Allen Hamilton","permalink":"booz-allen-hamilton","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0010/9453/109453v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,36],"assets/images/resized/0010/9453/109453v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[259,38],"assets/images/resized/0010/9453/109453v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Lincoln Laboratory","permalink":"lincoln-laboratory","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Early Induction in Sigma Gamma Tau Aerospace Honor Society","stoned_year":1991,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Haughwout","permalink":"jim-haughwout"}},{"description":"Lockheed Martin Information Services Sector President's Award","stoned_year":1993,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Haughwout","permalink":"jim-haughwout"}},{"description":"Lockheed Martin Special Commendation for Special Service -
