Prior to Motorola, Drieu worked at Apple between 2006 and 2010 where he was in charge of the Rich Media and Applications Group. In that context, he led a cross-organizational project sponsored by executive management to deliver the next-generation web standards-based media and graphics platform. Drieu and his team spearheaded the invention of CSS3 Transforms, Transitions and Animations, HTML5 Video and WebGL in collaboration with Google and Mozilla. As a result, these leading edge technologies have shipped at the core of key Apple products such as iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV and Mac OS X. Before Apple, Drieu worked for Adobe (coming from Macromedia) where he managed the engineering design and development of three major releases of Flash. Drieu headed up and shipped the first rich media advertising platform in collaboration with DoubleClick. He was a member of the pioneering team that invented Flash Video and enabled the exponential growth of video consumption on the web with companies such as YouTube.
