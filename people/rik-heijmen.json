The website that allows you to create a ring with an engraving on the outside. Using a full 3D interface where you can view your uniquely ring from every angle before you buy. </p>\n\n<p>Rik is an accomplished Dutch entrepreneur having founded and creatively led ad agencies in Amsterdam. After he sold his interactive ad agency in 2008, he invested in the start-up of Alphabeth.com, which aims to create concepts that allow people to engage in creative expression.</p>\n\n<p>The website Typerings.com was launched May 2011. It is a 3D platform that allows people to design a gold or silver ring with text or design on the outside, using of of eight divergent fonts. The website delivers in over 30 countries.</p>\n\n<p>At the time Rik and his wife got married back in 2000, they had trouble finding the perfect wedding rings. They knew exactly what it should look like: a text on the outside, on white gold bands, in a certain typeface. It was hard to find for a reasonable price. In 2010 (they were married for 10 years) Rik decided to get new rings. With the same concept. And of course, he went on the Internet to look for the &#8216;Nike iD for wedding rings&#8217; to find out it simply wasn&#8217;t there. That&#8217;s when he decided to do it himself.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0536/140536v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Rik Heijmen / <a href=\"http://www.alphabeth.com\" title=\"Alphabeth Group\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alphabeth Group</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, founder","firm":{"name":"Typerings.com","permalink":"typerings-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Typerings.com","permalink":"typerings-com","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0754/140754v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.springwise.com/style_design/typerings/","title":"Springwise"},{"external_url":"http://www.design-milk.com/typerings-and-giveaway","title":"Design-Milk"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/rikheijmen","title":"LinkedIn Profile"},{"external_url":"http://www.alphabeth.com","title":"Alphabeth Group website"}]}
