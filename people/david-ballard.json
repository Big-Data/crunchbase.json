From an early age David discovered his equal love for video games and music (and sandwiches).  Due to his unique academic path he has gained a healthy balance of skill in music composition/recording, game design, and sound design.  A wide skill set empowers him to be creatively invested in every aspect of a given project, and to put a great deal of care into more than just his specific duties.  David is an idea powerhouse as well as an enemy of onions and popcorn.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Developer Relations, Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Tap.Me","permalink":"metamoorephosis-games","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/2547/62547v12-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/2547/62547v12-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/2547/62547v12-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
