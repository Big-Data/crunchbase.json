Shortly following his 10th birthday, Nir had started showing a distinct interest in software development.

Since that time, Nir had been involved in various forms of the Israeli IT and software industry, ranging from software development, cyber security and forensics and intrusion testing.</p>\n\n<p>Since the year 1996, Nir had become increasingly involved in the Israeli Open Source movement. Nir became a figure role at the Technion (1996-2000), where he became an Open Source evangelist and champion for the cause, promoting the usage of Linux and Open Source projects. Nir is currently best known for his involvement with the Asterisk Open Source PBX project, being the founding father of the Israeli Asterisk users group, an active lecturer about Asterisk in Israel and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Early 2007, Nir had founded Greenfield Technologies Ltd.
