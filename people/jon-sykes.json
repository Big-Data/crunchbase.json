He has a string of small pet projects - some of which have grown to become very successful.  All of his projects have set to provide value to a very small niche of people.  The vast majority are free, advertless services, there for the better good.</p>\n\n<p>He has since 2007 run a site called hexday which has gain a small yet dedicated group of contributors, who pick a single hex color every day.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of 2008, he scored great success with the site usernamecheck.com which checked user names (or handles) across some 60+ web 2.0 social networks.  The site gain critical acclaim from internet brand managers, SEO experts, internet stalkers and a number of online child protection agencies and charities.</p>\n\n<p>It exposed the somewhat frustrating situation that was arising from the importance of a username registered with social networks, and the land rush with squatters and brand dilution similar to the early domain name purchases and sales.</p>\n\n<p>Upon reaching the 500,000 unique username target, he closed the site down, citing &#8220;it was just a pet project&#8221;.  Since then the domain name has changed hands, and a number of clone sites have been developed to fill the void - many of them created using the code that he published on the site on a page entitled &#8220;Behind the curtain&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>He continues to work on new ideas, whilst maintaining his day job at web development agency mediahive.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5196/155196v2-max-150x150.png"],[[243,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5196/155196v2-max-250x250.png"],[[300,308],"assets/images/resized/0015/5196/155196v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Usernamecheck","permalink":"usernamecheck","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,15],"assets/images/resized/0003/9773/39773v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,25],"assets/images/resized/0003/9773/39773v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,45],"assets/images/resized/0003/9773/39773v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://news.cnet.com/usernamecheck-knows-where-your-name-is-still-available/","title":"Cnet Article about Usernamecheck"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://jon.sykes.me","title":""},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jpsykes","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jpsykes","title":""},{"external_url":"http://onlyslightlyuseful.com/","title":""},{"external_url":"http://mediahive.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://madebyrobot.com/","title":""}]}
