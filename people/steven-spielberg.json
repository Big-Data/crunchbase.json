The three-time Academy Award winner is the highest grossing filmmaker of all time.  As of 2006, the magazine Premiere listed him as the most powerful and influential figure in the motion picture industry.  In a career that spans almost four decades, Spielberg&#8217;s films have touched many themes and genres. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, three of his films, Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Jurassic Park became the highest grossing films for their time. During his early years as a director, his sci-fi and adventure films were often seen as the archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his movies began addressing such historical issues as the Holocaust, slavery, war, and terrorism.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/9019/19019v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/9019/19019v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/9019/19019v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/7446401@N05/445577315/\" title=\"IrishDave5000 / Flickr\" rel=\"nofollow\">IrishDave5000 / Flickr</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"The Rising","permalink":"the-rising","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/9015/19015v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,148],"assets/images/resized/0001/9015/19015v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,178],"assets/images/resized/0001/9015/19015v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
