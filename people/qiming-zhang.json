As a leading expert in electroactive polymers in the world, he has over 260 publications and 9 patents in this field. He also has co-edited 4 books and contributed many chapters in electroactive polymers and related technologies. His group discovered and developed electrostrictive polymers with high strain responses, developed microfluidic devices and microactuators based on EAPs, proposed and demonstrated ultrahigh dielectric constant hybrid nanometamaterials based on delocalized electron system, and more recently, the dielectric polymers with high electric energy density for capacitor applications. His research has been funded by NIH, DOE, DOD, NSF, and many companies.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President & CTO","firm":{"name":"Strategic Polymer Sciences","permalink":"strategic-polymer-sciences","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0004/7333/47333v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/7333/47333v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0004/7333/47333v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
