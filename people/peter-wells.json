He began as a technical writer and editor, establishing himself at Cisco Systems during their meteoric rise between 1996 and 2000. At Cisco, he rose to head the Style Committee and was named chief editor of the vital, 12,000-page product catalog, managing it through to print and on-line production. A highly skilled pianist, Peter approached eMusic.com in early 2000 and convinced them to rethink their classical music strategy. He was brought on at the director level, and was soon one of the key players in label relations, content acquisition and contract negotiations. Peter helmed a team responsible for everything from marketing-side site development to copy to market positioning. For two years, he helped shape the destiny of eMusic until its acquisition by Universal-Vivendi.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP Operations, Customer Advocate","firm":{"name":"TuneCore","permalink":"tunecore","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,121],"assets/images/resized/0001/9897/19897v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,202],"assets/images/resized/0001/9897/19897v1-max-250x250.png"],[[285,231],"assets/images/resized/0001/9897/19897v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
