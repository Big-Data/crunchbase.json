There he also became a professionally trained tea taster.</p>\n\n<p>Alastair then moved to dunnhumby, where he led the growth of its web-based marketing intelligence product to Â£20m in three years. Alastair joined dunnhumbyâ€™s Strategic Management Board in 2005 to head up the groupâ€™s Shopping Experience practice, a $60m+ business globally.</p>\n\n<p>Alastairâ€™s grandfather was the inspiration behind starting his own dot-com, Huddle.net. To celebrate this, Huddleâ€™s holding company is named after one of grandfatherâ€™s inventions â€“ Ninian, the biggest ever concrete platform ever built.</p>\n\n<p>When not running the company, Alastair enjoys skiing, snowboarding, hiking, diving and driving. The latter has become an infrequent affair as Alastair passionately believes in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0001/6992/16992v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0001/6992/16992v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,304],"assets/images/resized/0001/6992/16992v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Alastair Mitchell / <a href=\"http://www.huddle.com/about/news/media-library\" title=\"Huddle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Huddle</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Huddle","permalink":"huddle","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/6947/16947v8-max-150x150.png"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/6947/16947v8-max-250x250.png"],[[450,133],"assets/images/resized/0001/6947/16947v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
