He joins Nansen from a role as UX and Design Director at Huddle, the online collaboration tool used by more than 90 000 clients including the UK government and Disney.</p>\n\n<p>Nansen&#8217;s strong technical skill set and their client track record is what attracted Orvet to the company:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Technical excellence is important, but only if one understands the person using the technology. Very few agencies understand the importance of this and even fewer manage to successfully combine it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Orvet will be based in San Francisco and Chicago to develop Nansen&#8217;s service offerings with a strong focus on innovation and user experience. There he will also work closely with the agency&#8217;s partner network:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By adding more skills to Nansen we become an even more involved participant to partners like Simple Truth, DDB NY, Söderhavet, Great Works and Ogilvy NY. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Orvet is also the co-founder of writing app <a href=\"http://skrivr.com\" title=\"Skrivr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrivr</a> and co-author of &#8220;Noded - The untouchable business&#8221;.
