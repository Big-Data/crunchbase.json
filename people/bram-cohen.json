Bram is also the co-founder of CodeCon and the co-author of Codeville. Prior to the creation of BitTorrent, Bram worked at MojoNation. MojoNation allowed people to break up confidential files into encrypted chunks and distribute those pieces to other computers running MojoNations software. This concept served as the inspiration for Bram&#8217;s development of BitTorrent. Before MojoNation, Bram was a quintessential dot-commer, working for several Internet companies through the mid-to-late 90s. Bram grew up in New York City, graduated from Stuyvesant High School and attended the University of Buffalo.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,122],"assets/images/resized/0001/7651/17651v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[85,122],"assets/images/resized/0001/7651/17651v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[85,122],"assets/images/resized/0001/7651/17651v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientist and Co-founder","firm":{"name":"BitTorrent","permalink":"bittorrent","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/0743/10743v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0743/10743v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,192],"assets/images/resized/0001/0743/10743v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"Flibe Energy","permalink":"flibe-energy","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Cohen","title":"Wikipedia: Bram Cohen"},{"external_url":"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_43/b4105046863317.htm","title":"October 2008 Interview With Business Week"}],"web_presences":[]}
