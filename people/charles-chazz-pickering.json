He began his career in retail finance working for one of the top 5 investment houses headquartered in the World Trade Center twin towers of NYC.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998, Charles left the retail investing world to take a sales position in a Las Vegas startup that had opened up offices in downtown Los Angeles on Wilshire. His sagacity for both technology and sales quickly elevated him into management. </p>\n\n<p>At the turn of the millennium he began his own venture, Sidustar International, Inc. The focus was in networks and network communications with a SaaS element. After the acquisition of his company he went into a Vice President role for another early stage startup with the objective of creating a funding source. This technology combined high volume network communications, telephony, digital devices, and service oriented architecture (SaaS) with an active-active infrastructure housed in Tier IV data-centers for life safety.</p>\n\n<p>By mid 2008, Charles and the former CIO of this latest startup got together to found a new venture in service oriented architecture consulting. The business premise was helping companies convert their standalone software into a SaaS model using open architecture technology. Unfortunately timing was bad for getting this venture off the ground and with his daughter on the way he went back into the life safety arena.</p>\n\n<p>This time it was with a 180 year old publicly traded enterprise that had just acquired several companies to create a new life safety division. This was its first venture into IP and it included two other routes to market. Charles&#8217; focus was on the IP side with integration into the systems side and RF technology. He lead his team covering 35 states and western Canada for almost 3 years bringing in key resources to continue the charge even after he left.</p>\n\n<p>At present, Charles is the Executive Vice President of an international cloud computing startup. The company is designed as a disruptive and innovative cloud ecosystem. It is engineered for storage, social, communication, and content/file management with multi-point access over any digital device via a single login for the mobile and web platforms. Mr. Pickering is directly responsible for coining the phrase; &#8220;cloud entanglement&#8221;. He also currently sits on the Board of Advisors for three companies; one in technology, one in commercial real estate management, and one in auto sales.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/1818/191818v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[194,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/1818/191818v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[324,417],"assets/images/resized/0019/1818/191818v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Charles Pickering</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Information Technoloy","institution":"Walden University (Laureate International University Network)","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Charles joins NOS Communications in business development and sales for iVenue's software-on-demand.","stoned_year":1998,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/cwpickering","source_text":null,"source_description":"Charles Pickering moves from finance to technology.","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Charles (Chazz)","last_name":"Pickering","permalink":"charles-chazz-pickering"}},{"description":"Charles leaves NOS Communications to start his own venture in networks, cabling, LAN, managed services, and SaaS.","stoned_year":2000,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/cwpickering","source_text":null,"source_description":"Charles Pickering founds Sidustar International, Inc.","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Charles (Chazz)","last_name":"Pickering","permalink":"charles-chazz-pickering"}},{"description":"In Q4 of 2003, Charles sold most of his venture for an estimated 7 figure value.
