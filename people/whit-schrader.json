Professionally trained as a neuroscientist, I conducted human brain imaging research at Vanderbilt before starting my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience. In 2008, I founded the Nashville Learning Group, a tutoring company which connected graduate students to Nashville families. Wanting to provide the same high-end services for underprivileged families, I created a non-profit called The LYATH Foundation in 2009. Since leaving my PhD in Neuroscience, I founded Schrader Labs, LLC as an entrepreneurial think-tank for innovative networking solutions. Our first project is Pearescope, a mobile social networking service which introduces you to nearby mutual LinkedIN and Facebook friends. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/4534/164534v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/4534/164534v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[327,429],"assets/images/resized/0016/4534/164534v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Neuroscience, German","institution":"Bowdoin College","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Pearescope","permalink":"pearescope","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/1969/151969v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/1969/151969v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,300],"assets/images/resized/0015/1969/151969v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
