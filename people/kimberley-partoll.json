Partoll is currently Chairman of the Board of NY-based PeekYou.com (http://www.peekyou.com), a free people-search engine, whose database contains public records and internet data for over 230 million people, and is growing every day. The information it collects about specific individuals includes real name, age, sex, physical address, e-mail address, online aliases, photos, blogs, personal profiles on popular websites, interests, schools, work history, etc.â€”and is packaged in individual profiles about each person. PeekYou searches and indexes people just as Google does with websites. PeekYou&#8217;s deep data is a unique resource through which businesses can acquire knowledge about their current and potential customers and thus execute highly targeted ad campaigns. The idea behind the database began in April 2006: the website was released a few months later in stealth mode, and now ranks as a top 5,000 web destination.</p>\n\n<p>As COO of AOL until October 1, 2009, Partoll oversaw the execution of AOLâ€™s strategic areas, with a focus on expanding AOLâ€™s offerings globally and to mobile platforms.
