Nitin started Saber in July 1998 and helped grow it a minimum of 50% each year.</p>\n\n<p>Saber&#8217;s growth was celebrated by an Inc. 500 award in both 2006 and 2007, the Deloitte Fast 500 award, and the #1 spot on Oregon&#8217;s Fastest Growing Companies list in 2007. This dramatic growth led to a significant investment by Accel-KKR Private Equity in 2005 and to the eventual sale of the company for $460MM to EDS in December 2007. Nitin then assumed leadership of EDS&#8217; government business operation that included Saber.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Saber, Nitin held a number of positions in Consulting and Education at Oracle Corporation. He holds Master&#8217;s and Bachelor&#8217;s of Engineering degrees from Purdue University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/4456/134456v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[163,205],"assets/images/resized/0013/4456/134456v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[163,205],"assets/images/resized/0013/4456/134456v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MS","subject":"Industrial Engineering","institution":"Purdue","graduated_year":1993,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Industrial Egineering","subject":"BS","institution":"Purdue","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"MergerTech Advisors","permalink":"mergertech-advisors","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/8825/168825v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/8825/168825v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0016/8825/168825v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Saber Corporation","permalink":"saber-corporation","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/futuristic_location_platform_geoloqi_will_live_lan.php","source_description":"Futuristic Location Platform Geoloqi Will Live, Lands Funding ","raised_amount":350000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Geoloqi","permalink":"geoloqi","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/5258/105258v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,123],"assets/images/resized/0010/5258/105258v5-max-250x250.png"],[[315,155],"assets/images/resized/0010/5258/105258v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/cloudability-raises-1-1m-to-help-businesses-manage-and-monitor-cloud-costs/","source_description":"Cloudability Raises $1.1M To Help Businesses Manage And Monitor Cloud Costs","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":22,"company":{"name":"Cloudability","permalink":"cloudability","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0013/5539/135539v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.finsmes.com/2011/11/meridian-closes-1m-seed-funding.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+finsmes%2FcNHu+%28FinSMEs%29","source_description":"Meridian Closes $1M Seed Funding","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":14,"company":{"name":"Meridian","permalink":"meridian","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/4992/154992v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/4992/154992v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,256],"assets/images/resized/0015/4992/154992v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nitin-khanna/0/b96/158","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
