Sean established himself in the startup world during the early stages of Tagged.com, one of the largest social networks in the world. He helped grow Tagged from 2 million users to a profitable company with 60 million users. His next step was a more personal endeavor: FamilyOven.com, a online recipe site he dedicated to his mother. The site pulled in 1 million members and became operationally profitable within its first six months.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, he transitioned to the mobile industry when he co-founded PointAbout, Inc., a mobile consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. Specializing in iPhone- and Android-based development, PointAbout flourished as a major mobile brand on the east coast and cultivated relationships with such industry leaders as Disney, Newsweek and the United States Army. He sold PointAbout in early 2011.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, AppMakr disrupted the mobile community. Sean was the visionary behind AppMakr, a fully automated platform for creating native applications. AppMakr was revolutionary in that it was scaled to build thousands of fully native apps a day without any manual intervention. Because of concepts such as build queues, application quality index, app simulation and the ability to download a fully built apps in seconds, AppMakr users could create rich native apps, for free, and submit them under their own brands in the App Store. To date, AppMakr is still the largest no code needed, do-it-yourself app creation site, boasting over 4000 apps in the app market, hundreds of apps created every day, and app creators ranging from Newsweek to The Atlantic Wire to 15-year-old entrepreneurs and helping its users create new businesses off the tool.</p>\n\n<p>Through his experience with AppMakr, Sean saw an opportunity to address a growing engagement and usability problem in the mobile industry. By capitalizing on the new way users consumed apps on their mobile devices, Sean formulated a way to seed and expand a userâ€™s interest graph to provide a cohesive experience, predict future usage and spending, and to help identify and connect a userâ€™s inventory across their multitude of devices. Socialize, Inc. turned those concepts into a product called â€œSocializeâ€: a secure social/interest layer SDK for mobile apps that will connect users, bring those users back to an app more regularly, and in turn, help advertisers and publishers in a way that has never been possible before. By using mobile devices and apps as an entry point, Sean hopes to reinvent the mobile experience and correct the dilemma of vertically fragmented devices.</p>\n\n<p>Sean is no stranger to sharing his expertise on the future landscape of technology, mobile and startups/entrepreneurship. He has appeared on Bloomberg TV as a guest expert and was also featured in The Washington Post, Wired, ABC News, Entrepreneur Magazine, FastCompany and TechCrunch. The Washington Post dubbed him a â€œstrategic genius.â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[131,130],"assets/images/resized/0016/4086/164086v2-max-150x150.png"],[[131,130],"assets/images/resized/0016/4086/164086v2-max-250x250.png"],[[131,130],"assets/images/resized/0016/4086/164086v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CSO & Cofounder","firm":{"name":"AppMakr","permalink":"appmakr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-150x150.png"],[[175,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-250x250.png"],[[175,75],"assets/images/resized/0010/6040/106040v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"FamilyOven","permalink":"familyoven","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/2146/2146v1-max-150x150.png"],[[189,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/2146/2146v1-max-250x250.png"],[[189,58],"assets/images/resized/0000/2146/2146v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President  & co-founder","firm":{"name":"Socialize","permalink":"socialize","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0004/2106/42106v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0004/2106/42106v7-max-250x250.png"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0004/2106/42106v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
