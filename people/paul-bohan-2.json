Bohan is the CEO of Connected Studios, Inc. which he founded in April 2008 with his wife Sabrina. Bohan previously founded a number of companies including most notably Bohan Group LLC in 1995 where he served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for thirteen years. Under his leadership, the Company grew to become the second largest fixed income analytics firms in the world, employing over 500 people in 4 countries. He sold Bohan Group to Fortune 500 Company First American.  Simultaneously, Bohan assumed leadership of Bohan Company, a commercial real estate firm, which he turned around in less than 2 years, and negotiated an internal employee buyout in 2004. </p>\n\n<p>Bohan discovered his love for music and started to play guitar at the age of twelve. Today, he is proficient at playing a variety of instruments including guitar, bass, drums and piano. In 2009 he built a state-of-the-art recording studio to record the original samples, or loops, for Connected Studios, but he also willingly shares it with his professional musician friends for late night jam sessions or serious recordings. </p>\n\n<p>In his free time Bohan plays at local venues and has played on stage with notables including Phil Lesh and Buddy Guy. He lives at home in Northern California with his wife of 15 years, his two children, his dog Chaya and his cat Sally, and is now exploring his range as a vocalist.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6390/96390v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6390/96390v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,400],"assets/images/resized/0009/6390/96390v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Political Science","subject":"","institution":"UCSB","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"ToonsTunes","permalink":"toonstunes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,105],"assets/images/resized/0005/9669/59669v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0005/9669/59669v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0005/9669/59669v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"ToonsTunes.com, the first music-inspired virtual world that allows kids to create original music, and then share that music with friends, re-launched with new features. 600% increase in ToonsTunes traffic after features were added.
