Prior to working at Bug Labs Ken was a senior developer at Antenna Software, and has a Computer Science degree from Montana State University.  </p>\n\n<p>At the tender age of 11, while probing the inner workings of the 555 timer, Ken discovered that building systems is easier in software than in hardware.  His TI 99/4A got him hooked, and his soldering days are long in the past, thus keeping the world (and his living room rug) safe from any (additional) fires.</p>\n\n<p>Ken is a frequent contributor to open source projects, specifically including Eclipse, Concierge, Scrollbox, and others. He firmly believes machines have souls and is on a mission to make that vision a reality. Ken also enjoys cycling to work immersed amongst chaotic NYC motorists.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":" ","firm":{"name":"Bug Labs","permalink":"buglabs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,92],"assets/images/resized/0000/2233/2233v1-max-150x150.png"],[[126,92],"assets/images/resized/0000/2233/2233v1-max-250x250.png"],[[126,92],"assets/images/resized/0000/2233/2233v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP, Engineering","firm":{"name":"Sonic Notify","permalink":"sonic-notify","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0017/1756/171756v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0017/1756/171756v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0017/1756/171756v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
