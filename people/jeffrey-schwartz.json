Already endowed with strong financial acumen, the experience rounded out Jeffreyâ€™s abilities, providing him with an important operational and sales background.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, Vice President, Juvenile for Dorel Industries (the public company), Jeffrey was named Vice President, Finance in the late 1980s and later Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. These positions have become increasingly strategic over the years, as the Company has evolved through various acquisitions to become a global consumer products leader in juvenile and home furnishings. Jeffrey currently oversees the finance function at all Dorel companies and regularly deals with the many financial analysts who follow the Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Dorel is a global consumer products company, the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer and distributor of juvenile products, among the top two ready-to-assemble furniture manufacturers in North America and the largest US bicycle distributor. Sales in 2003 were US$1.2 billion with US$75 Million in Net Income.
