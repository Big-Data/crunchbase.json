Gaming led to a fusion of an interest in art with the new software tools and the web. This led into experimentation with architectural rendering, drawing, photography, and 2D/3D image creation.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of taking up a university degree in mathematics at the University of Helsinki, independent animation and rendering experiments led to a first full-time job as a 3D-visualist in a Finnish architectural studio.</p>\n\n<p>He graduated with a degree in visual design from the Lahti University of Applied Sciences (Institute of Design) in 2005, with internships and exchanges in Spain, Germany and South America. Experienced as a tech freelancer for a design studio, animation and post-production for TV and film, he started studies in New Media (Master of Arts) at the Aalto University School of Art and Design (2007). Studies included a minor subject in East-Asian studies at University of Helsinki.</p>\n\n<p>New projects in game design and cinematography spawned a portfolio at http://generationpez.net.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, the Startup Life project curated and funded a small batch of entrepreneurial Aalto University students for an experience in the Bay area. After nine months developing and launching a Facebook integration channel for Zendesk, Mikko returned to Helsinki to design applications and living services for Fjord.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/3222/153222v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/3222/153222v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,400],"assets/images/resized/0015/3222/153222v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>All rights reserved</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Visual design and new media","institution":"Lahti University of Applied Sciences","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MA","subject":"New Media","institution":"University of Art and Design Helsinki","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Software engineer","firm":{"name":"Zendesk.com","permalink":"zendesk-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"__","permalink":"--","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"____","permalink":"----","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"_","permalink":"-","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"___","permalink":"---","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Visual designer","firm":{"name":"Fjord","permalink":"fjord","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://startuplife.in","title":"Startup Life"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/Mimikou","title":"Connections"},{"external_url":"http://generationpez.net","title":"Portfolio"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/mimikou","title":"CV"}]}
