As part of his doctoral work, he built and studied game-based mechanisms to motivate appropriate challenges in peer-to-peer online learning networks. Thousands of teachers participated in the study, and tens of thousands of their students actively engaged in the learning games. </p>\n\n<p>Ari has been lucky to have had the opportunity to participate in a variety of highly-productive social learning environments &#8211; including academic research labs and industry startups &#8211; and he tries to imbue the best of these learning dynamics into the systems that the builds. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/1054/111054v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/1054/111054v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/1054/111054v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Brandeis University","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Principal Learning Architect","firm":{"name":"The Minerva Project","permalink":"the-minerva-project","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0018/2525/182525v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0018/2525/182525v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[352,100],"assets/images/resized/0018/2525/182525v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Learning Architect","firm":{"name":"Grockit","permalink":"grockit","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,140],"assets/images/resized/0000/3787/3787v4-max-150x150.png"],[[247,232],"assets/images/resized/0000/3787/3787v4-max-250x250.png"],[[247,232],"assets/images/resized/0000/3787/3787v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/aribadernatal","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twosigma.org","title":"Blog"},{"external_url":"https://grockit.com/research","title":"Research"},{"external_url":"http://aribadernatal.com/publications.html","title":"Publications"}]}
