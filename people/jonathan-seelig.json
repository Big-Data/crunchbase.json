Based in Boston, he focuses on investments in Communications and Internet/Infrastructure companies. Jonathan, a successful entrepreneur himself, shares his company creation and operating experience, technical expertise, and broad international perspective to help the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies succeed. </p>\n\n<p>Jonathan serves on the boards of Pursway and SundaySky and led the firm&#8217;s investment in Linden Lab. He is also an observer on the board of Certeon. Previously, he served on the boards of 5min (acquired by AOL),Dotomi (acquired by ValueClick), Provigent (acquired by Broadcom) and Zipcar (NASDAQ:ZIP), where he was an early investor and longtime Chairman of the Board.     </p>\n\n<p>Jonathan co-founded Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the leading global Internet content and application delivery services company. At Akamai, he managed global infrastructure development and deployment, international expansion, and business development in a fast-growth environment. He knows first-hand the challenges of managing a high growth startup. &#8220;I love being with entrepreneurs who are building fast paced, innovative and highly responsive companies.&#8221; At Globespan, the companies he works with &#8220;know that they can ask me for advice on absolutely any issue. I&#8217;ve seen many of them before.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur-turned-venture capitalist, Jonathan got his introduction to venture capital trying to raise money for his company. &#8220;We had a very supportive and productive relationship with many of our early investors, so I learned just how much value a good angel investor or VC can add to a company.&#8221; He believes that working as a team is essential, which means &#8220;asking for help when I need it, giving help when I am asked, and accepting help when it is offered.&#8221; At Globespan, Jonathan enjoys &#8220;meeting and getting to know passionate entrepreneurs who love what they do everyday.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>Before he co-founded Akamai, Jonathan worked at ECI Telecom in Israel where he held roles in product marketing and new product development, working with customers in nearly 40 countries around the world. </p>\n\n<p>Jonathan earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, with honors, from Stanford University. He was enrolled for an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management, but left the program to found Akamai instead &#8220;much to my mother&#8217;s chagrin.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan lives in Cambridge with his wife and three sons. He plays tennis and golf, collects contemporary art, and serves on the Boards of Trustees of the Institute for Contemporary Art in Boston and the Arnold P. Gold Foundation for Humanism in Medicine in New Jersey.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/2943/72943v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/2943/72943v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,320],"assets/images/resized/0007/2943/72943v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing
