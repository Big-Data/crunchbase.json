Cram was later launched on the Mac and iPhone as was a top app in the education category receiving recognition by Apple as an ‘Staff Pick’ on multiple occasions.</p>\n\n<p>Ashli has recently released SimpleLeap Software’s first web app Workitywork, an app that helps create a happier workplace and has moved to the San Francisco bay area in attempt to make the world a better place with apps.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0019/6128/196128v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0019/6128/196128v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0019/6128/196128v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.ashlinorton.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"SimpleLeap Software","permalink":"simpleleap-software","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/4609/24609v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[236,98],"assets/images/resized/0002/4609/24609v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[236,98],"assets/images/resized/0002/4609/24609v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.ashlinorton.com","title":"Website"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/ashlinorton","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/ashli","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
