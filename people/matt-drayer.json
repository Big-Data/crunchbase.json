Big solutions.  Systems of all sorts intrigue me.  I love it when systems are humming smoothly, when people are communicating, when processes are unimpeded, when tools are enabling.  That&#8217;s when products hit the market quickly and  feedback rolls in effortlessly.  That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;re on to something huge.</p>\n\n<p>I advise zero-stage to early-stage initiatives.  I focus mainly on advising founders in need of technical guidance and/or looking to build out their teams.  Unlike many out there, my advice comes with no strings attached.  After all, they&#8217;re your strings, you should decide who to attach them to, how to attach them, and when.</p>\n\n<p>So shoot me a note and we&#8217;ll talk about the thorn in your side.  The one that&#8217;s been keeping you up at night, every night.  We&#8217;ll devise a strategy for solving it, right there at the table.  We&#8217;ll get the people talking, get the process flowing, get the tool helping.  We&#8217;ll get the system humming.  Now wouldn&#8217;t that be great?</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/0184/210184v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/0184/210184v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/0184/210184v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"Environmental Sciences","institution":"University of Massachusetts Amherst","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager / Core Services / Cloud Applications and Services","firm":{"name":"Carbonite","permalink":"carbonite","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/3493/3493v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://about.me/mattdrayer","title":""},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/mattdrayer","title":""}]}
