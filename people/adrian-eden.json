He spent his early years living throughout western Canada and in Central America (Costa Rica mainly) where he graduated from the American International School. He then went on to attend the University of Victoria on Vancouver Island. From there he attended the Institute of Advanced Media in Vancouver to earn a professional website development diploma. He found that his specialty was SEO and Internet Marketing, so he took a job with CalvinAyre.com and was mentored by some of the best in the industry. He now does work through his own business and word of mouth. You can find him in and around Vancouver Canada going to the gym or enjoying the nightlife scene. He is also an avid hiker and outdoors-man.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0010/5454/105454v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,220],"assets/images/resized/0010/5454/105454v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,397],"assets/images/resized/0010/5454/105454v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Internet Marketing Manager - Your City Heating & Cooling","firm":{"name":"Coleman Heating and Air Conditioning","permalink":"coleman-heating-and-air-conditioning","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/5655/105655v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/5655/105655v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/5655/105655v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://vancouverphotomarathon.com/stories/a-journey-with-photography-20101005/","title":"Vancouver Photography Marathon"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/AdrianEden","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adrianeden/","title":"Flickr"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/AdrianEdenDOTcom","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://ca.linkedin.com/in/adrianeden","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
