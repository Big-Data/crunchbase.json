He is Managing Director of Emerson Street Partners, helping entrepreneurs and VCs incubate new companies and accelerate growth of existing ones. Prior to launching Emerson Street Partners, Glenn spent 3 years as CEO of Scalix, a leading linux email and collaboration software vendor, taking it from a handful of customers to 600+ customers upon it&#8217;s sale to Xandros Corp. Before Scalix, he was Chief Operating Officer of NetIQ, a leading supplier of security and system management and web analytics software. As part of the co-founding team at NetIQ, he played an instrumental role in leading the company through an extended period of rapid growth from initial product launch in 1996 to IPO in 1999 (NTIQ) and ultimately $300 million in annual revenues in 2003. Winokur was responsible for all revenue, customer and partner related activities; including NetIQ&#8217;s landmark licensing and marketing agreement with Microsoft in 2000 which firmly established the company as the market leader in the windows systems management category. Prior to NetIQ, Winokur has held executive positions in sales and business development at several enterprise software companies, including Compuware, Frame Technology (now Adobe), Documentum (now EMC) and Ingres. Winokur received a B.S. in Business Administration and Marketing from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, and is a frequent guest lecturer, mentor and advisor at both the University of Illinois and Stanford University.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Chairman","firm":{"name":"Syapse","permalink":"syapse","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/6976/86976v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/6976/86976v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[324,94],"assets/images/resized/0008/6976/86976v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"DotNetNuke","permalink":"dotnetnuke-corporatio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/9799/29799v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/9799/29799v6-max-250x250.png"],[[367,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/9799/29799v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor / Advisor","firm":{"name":"Puppet Labs","permalink":"puppet-labs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0364/50364v11-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/0364/50364v11-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/0364/50364v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisory Board","firm":{"name":"Jive Software","permalink":"jive-software","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[420,200],"assets/images/resized/0000/0235/235v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://deals.venturebeat.com/?p=110398","source_description":"Reductive Labs scores $2M for Puppet IT automation tool","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":23,"company":{"name":"Puppet Labs","permalink":"puppet-labs","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/0364/50364v11-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/0364/50364v11-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0005/0364/50364v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Syapse","permalink":"syapse","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/6976/86976v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0008/6976/86976v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[324,94],"assets/images/resized/0008/6976/86976v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://emersonstreetpartners.com","title":"Emerson Street Partners"}]}
