It began with online marketing and sales for a few software companies in North and South America.  This forced me to learn about software development during the dot-com-bubble. With the evolution of the world wide web I started studying web and graphic design [thank you WordPress], search engine marketing, affiliate marketing investor and public relations.  In doing so I got a strong understanding of business planning and have used that to develop several successful business ventures.  I am currently working on Appiphany Technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Our newest project is the MMA Animals brand.  A fantasy based interactive CG cartoon / game.  The worlds first fantasy mixed martial arts brand.  Predevelopment of the MMA Animals is underway and we hope to offer MMA Animals products before Summer 2012.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Appiphany Technologies Corp","permalink":"appiphany-technologies-corp","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
