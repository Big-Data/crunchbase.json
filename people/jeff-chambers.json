HomeAway raised nearly 500M in debt and equity financing, making 12 acquisitions before his departure.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to his tenure at HomeAway, Chambers started one of the first MLS compliant Google Maps mash-ups for real estate called Zooven.com.  Zooven focused on the Austin market and provided agents with qualified real estate leads.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after leaving HomeAway to run Zooven full time, he founded BabysList.com - a marketplace for second hand baby items.  This venture teamed him up with several other startups in Austin around the baby/family vertical.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009, Chambers sold Zooven.com and acquired PropertyMaps.com - another real estate search company with national reach.  This acquisition was used to further PropertyMaps.com as well as launch another search vertical in the Vacation Rental space called VacationRentalsForSale.com.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010 he launched SharedEarth.com with Adam Dell, aiming to connect landowners and gardeners who aspire to see land used to it&#8217;s highest utilization and bring communities together through gardening and sharing of the crops.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[141,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7801/77801v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[221,235],"assets/images/resized/0007/7801/77801v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[221,235],"assets/images/resized/0007/7801/77801v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","firm":{"name":"PropertyMaps.com","permalink":"propertymaps","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0000/2431/2431v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0000/2431/2431v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[274,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/2431/2431v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","firm":{"name":"VacationRentalsForSale.com","permalink":"vacationrentalsforsale-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0007/3844/73844v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,43],"assets/images/resized/0007/3844/73844v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/3844/73844v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO/Advisor","firm":{"name":"SharedEarth.com","permalink":"sharedearth-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor","firm":{"name":"MommyMixer.com","permalink":"mommymixer-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/6611/156611v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/6611/156611v2-max-250x250.png"],[[320,320],"assets/images/resized/0015/6611/156611v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"US Product director at HomeAway.com","stoned_year":2005,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Chambers","permalink":"jeff-chambers"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreychambers","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
