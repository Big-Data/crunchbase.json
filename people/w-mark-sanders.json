From an early age, he remembers selling watermelons from a pick-up truck with his grandmother. When the melons werenâ€™t in season, he went door-to-door selling a variety of Stanley products. In 2003, Sanders decided to take his expertise of bringing products to people at home, to bringing homes to people. </p>\n\n<p>Sanders entered into the real estate investing arena and has since been involved in more than 7,000 properties. However, rather than just profiting on the sale of properties, Sanders says he realized the opportunity laid with helping consumers afford to own a primary residence. In the process, Sanders could deliver investors good returns by transforming non-performing assets into profit-generating ones. So he started services that would help with acquisition, lending, renovation, and property/asset management.</p>\n\n<p>â€œReal estate is comprised of multiple risks,â€ Sanders said. â€œHowever, real estate also has the ability to produce enormous profits if youâ€™re able to simultaneously systemize its multiple income streams.â€ </p>\n\n<p>So Sanders sought to build a full-service system that would significantly reduce the risk for investors while creating an opportunity for consumers to own a home. That is the key to solving todayâ€™s housing and lending crises in America, according to Sanders.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2009, Sanders conceived the Americaâ€™s Home Program concept.</p>\n\n<p>â€œSince I have access to many discounted properties, I started building a system that would benefit both investors and home owners,â€ he said. â€œThe result is a business that does four things; itâ€™s a full-service turnkey solution for investors and future home owners, it stabilizes our communities, provides worthy families with a proven solution for home ownership and maximizes real estate investments.â€</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Business","institution":"University of North Carolina","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Masters","subject":"Business Administration","institution":"University of North Carolina","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Juris Doctorate","subject":"Business Administration","institution":"University of North Carolina","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"Americaâ€™s Home Program, Inc.","permalink":"americas-home-program-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
