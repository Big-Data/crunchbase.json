Software development then became his main area of activity. When he was still at school, Anthony and his friend developed a program, which won first prize at a youth science conference. This was quite an achievement as Anthony did not even have a computer at home.</p>\n\n<p>Anthony graduated from Kemerovo State University as a qualified “Mathematician, Systems Programmer”. He joined EDISON Software Development Centre practically straight from university. Colleagues see Anthony as an example of how a programmer can rise to chief technical officer in a relatively short time thanks to diligence and commitment. He is also a natural teacher and enjoys helping other members of staff learn and develop their skills.</p>\n\n<p>Anthony’s professional interests include: cryptography, data protection, and the construction of complex mathematical algorithms. In his free time he does yoga and plays volleyball.</p>\n\n<p>Anthony takes a philosophical view of software development. He says creating software is like making a play: write a scenario, allocate roles to the different actors, and then at the crucial moment when the application is launched everything goes smoothly and according to plan. As a student, Anthony used to direct theatrical performances so this seems an appropriate parallel to draw.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0017/3049/173049v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,212],"assets/images/resized/0017/3049/173049v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,255],"assets/images/resized/0017/3049/173049v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS hons","subject":"Maths","institution":"Kemerovo State University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"EDISON Software Development Centre","permalink":"edison-software-development-centre","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,108],"assets/images/resized/0017/2532/172532v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[140,108],"assets/images/resized/0017/2532/172532v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[140,108],"assets/images/resized/0017/2532/172532v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=121892522","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
