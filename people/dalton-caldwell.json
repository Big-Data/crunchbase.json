In 2007, the company signed landmark agreements with the worldâ€™s four major record companies, becoming the first company to offer music to U.S. consumers to freely stream and share with the costs supported by advertising. That innovation helped imeem become one of the worldâ€™s leading online music services, reaching millions of people each month through the imeem site and its network of embedded music and video playlists. </p>\n\n<p>Caldwell graduated from Stanford University with dual degrees in Psychology and Symbolic Systems.
