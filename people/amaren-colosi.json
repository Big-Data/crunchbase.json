She began taking portraits at five years old with her mother&#8217;s old Canon, and though her aim didn&#8217;t quite match her enthusiasm (she always managed to cut off her dad&#8217;s head even when he graciously kneeled down in front of her lens), it was the beginning of an ongoing learning process that is at the core of her art. Amaren honed her passion in high school and earned her BFA in photography from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Since moving to Portland, she engages the city&#8217;s friendly accessibility to capture the quirky energy and creativity of its people, activities, food and architecture. When she&#8217;s not taking photos or petting one of her three kitties, Amaren strives to become a somewhat capable cook and likes to have Law &amp; Order: SVU marathons.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/4786/104786v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/4786/104786v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0010/4786/104786v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BFA","subject":"Photography","institution":"School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Contributor","firm":{"name":"Neighborhood Notes","permalink":"neighborhood-notes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.neighborhoodnotes.com/author/amaren/","title":"Neighborhood Notes Blog"}]}
