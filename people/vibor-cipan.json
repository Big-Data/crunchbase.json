UX Passion envisions, designs and delivers greatest user and service experiences. With passion! </p>\n\n<p>Starting in late 2009, Cipan became the CEO of a new company, FatDUX Zagreb. At the time when Cipan has assumed his role, he was the youngest CEO within the FatDUX Group and FatDUX Zagreb enjoyed the status of the fastest growing FatDUX office under Cipan’s lead. During 2011 FatDUX Zagreb office ceased to exist due to FatDUX Group&#8217;s reluctance to allow then FatDUX Zagreb management to have same relationship with the company like other affiliates had. Following that, Cipan, together with Antun Debak (Creative Director) and Darko Čengija (Chief information architect) have embraced very successful UX Passion brand transforming the previous office and returned FatDUX brand to their owner, FatDUX Groups Aps.</p>\n\n<p>Before FatDUX and UX Passion, Cipan worked at Microsoft Development Center in Copenhagen and before that at Microsoft Croatia. One thing, however, has stayed constant: his focus on user experience, service design, usability and information architecture. He has been awarded prestigious title Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for three years in a row (and is still currently holding that title). He was the youngest awardee and first one in the CEE Europe to receive the award while full-time student.</p>\n\n<p>Cipan previously worked at Microsoft Development Center in Copenhagen and before that at Microsoft Croatia.

He was the youngest awardee and first one in the CEE Europe to receive the award while full-time student.</p>\n\n<p>Cipan calls himself <em>a devigner</em> - in his own words - devigner &#8220;is a very special and unique breed. Instead of sitting on a chair, I&#8217;ve decided to be a bridge. I&#8217;m pixel pusher at heart, yet I&#8217;m confident navigating and understanding the code. Oh and throw in some business consulting and management and that would be my (dream) job.</p>\n\n<p>Today Cipan is well known professional and speaker, often seen talking at local and international conferences about user experience and service design topics, evangelizing and teaching the importance of the UX and service design for clients and building world class UX and service design solutions spanning the desktop, web, mobile and offline worldsâ€¦</p>\n\n<p>Cipan is book author and his book <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/silverlight-4-user-interface-cookbook/book\" title=\"Silverlight 4 User Interface Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silverlight 4 User Interface Cookbook</a> was the first book on the market to discuss and explain user experience and user interface patterns for Silverlight. </p>\n\n<p>He is an active blogger blogging at his <a href=\"http://www.uxpassion.com\" title=\"UX Passion blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">UX Passion blog</a> and he is on Twitter under <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/viborc\" title=\"@viborc\" rel=\"nofollow\">@viborc</a> name.
