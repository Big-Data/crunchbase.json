A manager with a strong vision and great people skills built on his 25 years in international feature film, television and TV commercials production, Adam has also initiated significant sustainability campaigns, built and managed sustainable property and was founder of SustainabiliTV.com. Since 2009, KeyWifi has been his primary focus - recruiting and managing team members, conducting fundraising and publicity, and setting business requirements for the product. KeyWifi is in it&#8217;s second iteration of development and testing as of March 2012.
