Michael believes this was one of the best learning experiences of his life.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by their passion for business, Michael and Chris founded Sharkey Media, a web development agency designed to help other businesses develop a successful online presence and work on their existing online businesses.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2010 Michael co-founded Bislr.com, a business he says &#8220;builds the valuable lessons we&#8217;ve learnt into a product anyone can use&#8221;. Bislr is a new, social approach to starting a business online.</p>\n\n<p>Michael’s enthusiasm for business and entrepreneurs certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed. Michael has been featured on Reuters, StartUpSmart, Anthill, The Australian, ABC radio, Sydney Morning Herald, and frequently contributes to Flying Solo, ShoeStringStartups and small business events.</p>\n\n<p>Michael is currently the CEO of Bislr.com.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/9196/99196v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/9196/99196v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0009/9196/99196v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Bislr","permalink":"bislr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0014/6324/146324v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,114],"assets/images/resized/0014/6324/146324v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,206],"assets/images/resized/0014/6324/146324v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lBJm4AkR1TE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>What&#8217;s been a dark moment for you and how did you overcome it?</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/vJQCYyvZaks\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Who are the people you need to know when entering a new market?</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.shoestring.com.au/2012/05/why-your-startup-will-probably-fail/","title":"Why your startup will probably fail"},{"external_url":"http://www.shoestring.com.au/2012/06/why-every-startup-should-hire-a-journalist/","title":"Why every startup should hire a journlaist"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.mikesharkey.com/blog","title":"Personal website"},{"external_url":"http://www.bislr.com","title":"Create an online business with Bislr"}]}
