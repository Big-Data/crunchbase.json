During the past seven years, Moe has rebuilt the management team of these properties and led their operational turnaround. He is intimately familiar with all aspects of hotel operations.</p>\n\n<p>To handle sales and marketing of these two hotels, Moe established Mozaic Hotels &amp; Resorts (www.themozaic.com) in late 2005 and assembled a team of hotel sales and marketing professionals to handle both online and offline distribution. By 2009, it had become evident that both the hotels and the Mozaic team were quickly losing direct consumers to digital channels. He founded Journeyful as a response.</p>\n\n<p>Moe is now focusing all of his efforts on expanding Journeyful and is relocating to San Francisco to establish Journeyfulâ€™s headquarters and to drive the process of establishing Journeyful sales offices in key markets around the world.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0011/5468/115468v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0011/5468/115468v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0011/5468/115468v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.journeyful.com","title":""}],"web_presences":[]}
