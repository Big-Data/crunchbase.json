He&#8217;s turbocharged everything from his Huffy 6-speed to his Amiga 500, and was the only 8 year old in St. Louis running engine coolant over his overclocked AMD 29000. He stayed true to the mid-west with a degree in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology and stays truer to the related stereotypes with underwater hockey, ultimate frisbee and WWII trivia. In the mind of Rob Meyer, all that stands between now and glory is some elegant code and a motorcycle.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/6914/146914v1-max-150x150.png"],[[240,180],"assets/images/resized/0014/6914/146914v1-max-250x250.png"],[[240,180],"assets/images/resized/0014/6914/146914v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"OpenChime","permalink":"openchime","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0013/7342/137342v1-max-150x150.png"],[[236,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/7342/137342v1-max-250x250.png"],[[236,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/7342/137342v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
