After completing his degree, he worked with Contata Solutions, which provided him with a solid platform and gave a new way to look at internet business. He is a great lover of music and also plays Congo sometimes. Internet surfing is one of his passions.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to develop my career as a developer. I learned a lot during my first two years at Contata Solutions. Then I thought to apply my whole programming skills on one unique website where I can express myself and which is also helpful to others. I thought for hours and hours and then I realized there were more than 10 ideas with me which were not yet made. How could I work on those 10 ideas, simultaneously? So I just started with Inventwheel.com. It sounds very promising and powerful than all other ideas I had.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s shake hands to make this world a better place to live. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/1263/41263v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/1263/41263v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,275],"assets/images/resized/0004/1263/41263v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Mr","firm":{"name":"Inventwheel","permalink":"inventwheel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0003/2865/32865v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[188,65],"assets/images/resized/0003/2865/32865v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[188,65],"assets/images/resized/0003/2865/32865v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
