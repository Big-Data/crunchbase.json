A graduate of The Founder Institute in Silicon Valley and Finalist in Boston&#8217;s MassChallenge, Tim has been exposed to a strong network within the entrepreneurial community and knows what it takes to build a successful business.  Rentcycle is not Tim&#8217;s first jaunt with a startup &#8211; while in college, Tim and his friends built an e-commerce apparel company which still operates today.</p>\n\n<p>Tim has also spent time in the corporate realm.  Prior to founding Rentcycle, Tim worked in business development for Cheskin Added Value, an innovation consulting firm.  Before that, he was Brand Manager at Red Hat Inc, where he strategically managed the brand portfolio for this global software company.
