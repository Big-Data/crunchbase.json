He soon transitioned to equity research, covering the satellite communication industry. Armand became the lead analyst covering the industry for Bank of America, and later Salomon Smith Barney. He earned numerous honors as research analyst, including being named to the Institutional Investor &#8220;All American&#8221; team three times (2000-2002) and The Wall Street Journal &#8220;All Star&#8221; team.

An avid mountain climber, he left this position in 2007 to train for his dream of completing his ascent of the highest mountain on each continent (&#8220;the 7 Summits&#8221;), which he accomplished with his ascent of Mt. Everest in May 2008. </p>\n\n<p>Upon returning from his mountaineering sabbatical, Armand founded Summit Ridge Group LLC, a private consulting firm. He continues to be a regular speaker at major industry conferences and is frequently quoted in trade publications and by national publications as an expert in finance and corporate governance. </p>\n\n<p>Armand is a graduate of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. He also holds a JD (cum laude) from Northwestern University Law School, an MA in Modern European Studies from Columbia University, and a BA (with honors) from the University of Chicago.
