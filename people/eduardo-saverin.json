Eduardo studied Economics as an undergraduate at Harvard College, where he received his BA in 2006. While at Harvard, Eduardo served as Harvard Investment Association&#8217;s President, and was known for making over three hundred thousand dollars betting on weather and oil futures. </p>\n\n<p>He met Mark Zuckerberg in his sophomore year while punching the Phoenix S.K. Club and later co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg during his junior year, assuming the role of business manager. However, due to internal conflicts and differences of opinion with Zuckerberg over the following summer when Saverin was living in New York (where he worked briefly as a finance intern), Saverin drifted from what was then known as thefacebook, a fast-growing Silicon Valley start-up. After outside investor principally venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel took control of the start-up&#8217;s finances and capital needs and backed Zuckerberg as its CEO, Saverin&#8217;s role diminished and his influence evaporated. His departure from Facebook was the subject of subsequent legal action. He later won the right to have his name listed among the other founders in a lawsuit. </p>\n\n<p>He is currently an investor in technology startups, including Qwiki and Jumio.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/8767/128767v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0012/8767/128767v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0012/8767/128767v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Economics ","institution":"Harvard","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Facebook","permalink":"facebook","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,169],"assets/images/resized/0000/4552/4552v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/17/exclusive-facebook-co-founder-eduardo-saverin-leads-6-5m-round-for-jumio/","source_description":"Exclusive: Facebook Co-Founder Eduardo Saverin Leads $6.5M Round For Jumio","raised_amount":6500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"Jumio","permalink":"jumio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,41],"assets/images/resized/0007/4285/74285v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[152,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/4285/74285v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[152,42],"assets/images/resized/0007/4285/74285v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/07/qwiki-8-million/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":8000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":7,"company":{"name":"Qwiki","permalink":"qwiki","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/2672/102672v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[203,70],"assets/images/resized/0010/2672/102672v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[203,70],"assets/images/resized/0010/2672/102672v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/02/facebook-co-founder-eduardo-saverin-leads-7m-round-in-scanning-and-product-search-app-shopsavvy/","source_description":"Facebook Co-Founder Eduardo Saverin Leads $7M Round In Scanning And Product Search App ShopSavvy","raised_amount":7000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":11,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"ShopSavvy","permalink":"shopsavvy","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/3592/123592v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/3592/123592v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/3592/123592v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://gigaom.com/2011/11/08/crowdmob-builds-a-tapjoygroupon-for-distributing-local-deals/","source_description":"CrowdMob builds a Tapjoy+Groupon for distributing local deals ","raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"CrowdMob","permalink":"crowdmob","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0017/3164/173164v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0017/3164/173164v5-max-250x250.png"],[[301,50],"assets/images/resized/0017/3164/173164v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/saverin","title":"Facebook"}]}
