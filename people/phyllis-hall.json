It has three stories and I live on the second story.  The suites with ocean views are located on the top story.</p>\n\n<p>My mother managed it solely on her own until she asked me to mange it.  She was born under the danish flag, in 1916, and still gives advice from time to time. She can trace her family on St. John for at least 5 generations. As of August 11, 2010, she and my sister, Elsa, have been living on site.</p>\n\n<p>Both parents were born in the Virgin islands, but met and got married in New York. My father entered the Navy, during World War II, where he learned about radios.  Later on I was born and grew up in Manhattan, New York, until the age of 11, where I also learned to speak Spanish.   This comes in handy, when speaking to guest from Hispanic Countries and Italy.  We left New York for the Virgin Islands, their homeland, and grew up on the lovely islands of St. John and St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0011/4999/114999v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0011/4999/114999v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0011/4999/114999v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Masters","subject":"Bio-Environmental Engineering","institution":"Howard University","graduated_year":1976,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"\"Perfect place to feel human again.\"\r\n\r\nVacation rental suites with ocean views, air condition, beach equipment, free Wi-Fi and menu.
