Heikki devotes as much free time as possible to enjoy this thinking man&#8217;s sport, where grown men chase after a round circular black object and hope not to strain anything in the process. Quite often the latter part is done poorly. </p>\n\n<p>Before landing his gig at Moogo, Heikki was off on an adventure in the current olympic capital of the world, Vancouver. During his stay, he managed to work for three different companies simultaneously without completely losing his tiny mind by doing Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations work.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/8087/78087v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[199,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/8087/78087v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[359,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/8087/78087v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BBA","subject":"Business","institution":"Metropolia University Of Applied Sciences","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Public Relations, Advertising","institution":"Lincoln University","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Localization Manager","firm":{"name":"Moogo","permalink":"moogo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0004/3776/43776v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0004/3776/43776v2-max-250x250.png"],[[341,98],"assets/images/resized/0004/3776/43776v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://fi.linkedin.com/in/heikkitirkkonen","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
