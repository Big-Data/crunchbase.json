Aw holds a Masters Degree in User Experience Design where she focused on both conceptual and visual design and usability research.</p>\n\n<p>She has since channeled her education and design into NOTCOT Inc, a network of informative and collaborative websites that doubles as a design consultancy. By keeping her readers (and her readers keeping her) on the cutting edge of design, this network demonstrates, inspires, and promotes smart, simple user experiences while stimulating a visual, aesthetic and textual dialogue between users and designers.</p>\n\n<p>While currently based in her hometown of Los Angeles, CA, she is very mobile, hopping around the country and across the globe, entrenching herself in international culture and their respective design hotspots. She often finds the most incredible things in the most unlikely of places and loves bringing them to her readers, often leaving them wondering whether the treasure was in their existence or in their discovery. </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.notcot.com\" title=\"NOTCOT.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">NOTCOT.com</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/5719/25719v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/5719/25719v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,80],"assets/images/resized/0002/5719/25719v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MA","subject":"Interaction Design","institution":"Domus Academy","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Interdisciplinary Computing in the Arts, Minor: Math","institution":"UC San Diego","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"NOTCOT","permalink":"notcot","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/5713/25713v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/5713/25713v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[167,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/5713/25713v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.notcot.com","title":"NOTCOT.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.notcot.org","title":"NOTCOT.org"},{"external_url":"http://www.notcouture.com","title":"NotCouture"},{"external_url":"http://www.liqurious.com","title":"Liqurious"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/notcot","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/notcot","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
