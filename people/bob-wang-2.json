When Wang started out, mammography was deemed unsafe for screening purposes due to its high radiation levels. The high-resolution and low-dose rare-earth x-ray radiography technology developed by Wang, which was sold to 3M with a license to Kodak, allowed a 95% dose reduction to mammography and gave rise to modern mammography as we know it today.\nIn 1997, Wang founded U-Systems, Inc. to develop the technology behind the somo•v® system.
