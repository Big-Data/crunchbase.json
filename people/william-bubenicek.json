He tends to take on ever-increasing challenges in an effort to learn and master multiple disciplines and ventures.  He joined the corporate world in 2003 after graduating from college and was promoted 3 times in 3 years, and by the time he left he was managing the P&amp;L for the flagship accounts and had over 100 employees to manage.  During the final 2 years of his employment he also completed an online MBA degree.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to traveling internationally and experiencing many cultures, Bill is also self-taught on the guitar and formed a band in 2008.  For the hell of it, they booked a gig in Hoboken NJ and were asked back to headline a few months later.  </p>\n\n<p>After he left his previous position, he joined the founder of a start up in NYC and began building an international trading business in the telecom space.  Bill quickly developed into the sales role and put multi million $ deals together with various companies across 3 continents.  He became a partner in the firm in 2007 and grew the company from 3 employees to over 90 worldwide.  Revenues grew from under 1M to 12M in 3 years as profit margins grew to over 50%.  </p>\n\n<p>Sensing a need for change, Bill exited his partnership in Aug 2009 and consulted until January 2010 on business, sales/marketing and succession planning.  Since then he took over a project called boardmybiz.com and has been working on getting the concept developed and the team set up so that he can continue pursuing new and exciting ventures.  </p>\n\n<p>In late 2009 Bill also took up Kung Fu as an added challenge and as a new discipline for his mind and body.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2576/82576v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[168,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2576/82576v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[168,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2576/82576v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Sociology, business administration","institution":"The University at Albany","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Executive MBA","subject":"Executive Business Administration","institution":"Colorado Technical University","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"BoardmyBiz","permalink":"boardmybiz","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0017/5605/175605v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0017/5605/175605v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/5605/175605v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Partner/Director","firm":{"name":"GSM Systems","permalink":"gsm-systems","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0012/1216/121216v1-max-150x150.png"],[[184,73],"assets/images/resized/0012/1216/121216v1-max-250x250.png"],[[184,73],"assets/images/resized/0012/1216/121216v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.boardmybiz.com","title":"Advisory Board Building: Simplified"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/wabubenicek","title":"linkedin"}]}
