Jones â€“ Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer</p>\n\n<p>Scott brings over two decades of experience and achievement to ChaCha as a veteran entrepreneur, inventor, strategist, and venture capitalist. His well-seasoned perspective and pioneering instincts provide unique direction for the gifted team that ChaCha continues to assemble.</p>\n\n<p>At age 25, Scott invented the massively scalable, easy-to-use voicemail system that has been used by over a billion people around the world. Subsequently, he built Gracenote, the company that supplies Internet-based music services for companies including Apple, Yahoo, and Sony. Gracenote services are being accessed globally at the rate of 24 billion times per year by applications such as iTunes.</p>\n\n<p>Two decades ago, Scott described publicly, during speeches in Hong Kong and London &#8211; well before desktop search engines and the Web were born â€“ a vision of people having access to all of mankindâ€™s knowledge, from anywhere, and at anytime. In late 2005, Scott realized that the enabling technologies of the Web and the ubiquity and portability of mobile devices finally provided the necessary pieces of the puzzle to manifest the dream. Hence, ChaCha was born. Scott is now driven by the singular focus of making ChaCha the worldâ€™s easiest-to-use and most comprehensive way to access information and answers while people are on the go.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to his focus on changing the world, Scott has traveled the globe with his family, loves to find great hole-in-the-wall eateries with Vee Vee and enjoys time with his sons playing basketball, blowing up things in kitchen science experiments, and watching random YouTube videos. His girlfriend recently gave birth to his fourth son Alexander Indiana Jones on July 11th, 2008.
