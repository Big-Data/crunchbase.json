Yottaa focuses on making websites faster, as well as providing testing and tuning services for website performance management.  Morris works with his colleagues on Yottaa&#8217;s senior leadership team to grow Yottaa&#8217;s market share.   </p>\n\n<p>While at Citrix Online, Morris grew the Corporate inside sales team from 2 managers and 10 sales reps to 6 managers and over 50 sales reps, driving market share growth and sales excellence.</p>\n\n<p>While he was VP of Sales at Intranets.com, Morris managed the entire sales team and helped implement a sales and marketing model that redefined the idea of an inside sales team.  After building the corporate sales team and establishing a consistent record of strong sales growth, the company achieved profitability and recognition as the world&#8217;s leading provider of collaboration services.  That success was recognized by WebEx Communications, which purchased Intranets.com and integrated the team into their collaboration offerings.  As a VP of Sales within WebEx, Morris continued to grow his team and their market share, later taking on sales responsibility for WebEx&#8217;s core services as well.  WebEx was purchased by Cisco Systems in 2007 and Morris managed the organizational transition for his teams while continuing to motivate his teams to achieve outstanding sales results.  </p>\n\n<p>Prior to working for Intranets.com, Morris was a Sales Manager at MCI/WorldCom, where he managed the New England region of the Wireless Division. While there, he built the sales team from scratch and established a history of sales quota overachievement and success.</p>\n\n<p>Before joining MCI/WorldCom, Morris worked for Metriplex, Inc., a leading provider of wireless data to the financial services industry. Morris was the top Metriplex sales representative, consistently achieving Presidents Club recognition by selling to accounts such as Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Fleet Bank, Merrill Lynch and American Express. He was later promoted to Sales Manager and continued to drive the success of the inside and field sales teams.</p>\n\n<p>Morris earned a BS in Management from the University of Massachusetts and an MBA with a focus in entrepreneurship from Babson College.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Management","institution":"University of Massachusetts","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Entrepreneurship","institution":"Babson College","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Joins Yottaa as Vice President of Sales and Business Development.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"morris-porter"}},{"description":"Joined Yottaa as VP of Sales & Business Development","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"morris-porter"}},{"description":"Joined Citrix Online as Director of Corporate Sales","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"morris-porter"}},{"description":"WebEx is acquired by Cisco Systems","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"morris-porter"}},{"description":"As part of the senior leadership team at Intranets.com, Morris helps orchestrate the sale of Intranets.com to WebEx Communications","stoned_year":2005,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"morris-porter"}},{"description":"Joins Intranets.com as a key player in transforming the service from \"intranet in a box\" to Software as a Service (SaaS)","stoned_year":2000,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"morris-porter"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
