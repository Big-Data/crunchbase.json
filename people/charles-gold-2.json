I have been a software marketing executive for nearly  20 years in start-ups and established public companies in both commercial and open source domains.  I believe passionately that as the software market matures, marketing is rapidly becoming the thing that sets winners apart from also-rans.  As a marketer, my strengths are product related â€” product marketing, positioning, and go-to-market strategy.</p>\n\n<p>I live in Fairfax Virginia with my wife, three kids, and a rescue dog.  I blog on software marketing at www.cgoldmarketing.com.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/8279/178279v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/8279/178279v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,320],"assets/images/resized/0017/8279/178279v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CMO","firm":{"name":"Sonatype","permalink":"sonatype","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0006/7994/67994v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0006/7994/67994v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,72],"assets/images/resized/0006/7994/67994v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
