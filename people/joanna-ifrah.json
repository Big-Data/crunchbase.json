Unlike thousands of other young girls, Joanna got a recording contract not once, but twice. But while singing was her passion and Madonna her idol, she instead set her sights on the business of music. </p>\n\n<p>Starting out as an engineer in a recording studio, Joanna worked her way up the music mogul ladder, holding senior creative jobs at three of the four major record labels, working with some of the biggest names in music history, and helping find and develop new talent. </p>\n\n<p>As trueAnthemâ€™s guiding light and visionary, Joanna has turned her attention and talents to what she sees as the next big thing in music: the social networking scene and ad supported, online digital distribution of music.
