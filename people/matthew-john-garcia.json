When the stock market crashed in 2008 and banks were failing, Washington Mutual being at the forefront, Garcia found himself a part of the job loss experience.</p>\n\n<p>The recession hit and jobs became less stable and difficult to land. However, this was not going to keep Garcia from pursuing his goals and making a name for himself.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, he used the recession as internalized motivation to establish his presence in San Antonio. Instead of wondering what his next employment position would be Garcia uprooted himself in the idea of beginning an online food ordering website for San Antonio.</p>\n\n<p>After having the business plan carefully laid out, the addition of a new member to the team only meant that the dream was closer to coming to life. Caroline Jang joined Garcia in 2009 with hopes of exploring her creativity.</p>\n\n<p>As Chief Financial Officer, Jang wanted to test her waters to see if she really had what it took to offer Garciaâ€™s company.</p>\n\n<p>â€œI wanted to help Matt with his business, but to me, it was a personal test because I wanted to prove it to myself, too, that we could make this happen. Iâ€™m thankful he was able to see that value in me,â€ says Jang now recent graduate of UTSA.
