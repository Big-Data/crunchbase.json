His research at Stanford and work at Powerset involved working on ranking algorithms for Web Search and applications of Artificial Intelligence to solve specific problems in information retrieval and other fields. </p>\n\n<p>Jonathan graduated with a Masters with Distinction in Research in Computer Science from Stanford University. He was awarded the Christofer Stephenson Memorial Award for Graduate Research for Best Masters Thesis at Stanford University for his work on SpotSigs:Near Duplicate Detection in Web Pages. At Stanford, Jonathan worked with Dr.Andreas Paepcke and Prof.Hector Garcia Molina of the Stanford InfoLab on problems of Context Driven Ranking for Search, Passage retrieval for Web Search, Supervised Web Page Classification and Near Duplicate Detection in Web pages which subsequently led to a publication in SIGIR&#8217;08.</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan&#8217;s primary focus of research has been applications of Machine Learning for learning &amp; optimizing Ranking functions &amp; algorithms for Web Search. Jonathan worked briefly at Powerset, where he was one of the scientists behind the initial ranking algorithms powering the Natural Language Search Engine. His work at Powerset with the Ranking group, involved developing &amp; improving the ranking function by exploiting various features derived from deep linguistic processing, semantic analysis, traditional keyword based analysis &amp; Web graph information.</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan&#8217;s undergraduate degree was from SVCE,(Anna University), Madras in Computer Science and Engineering where he graduated at the top of his graduating class in 2005. His undergraduate research publications spanned applications of Artificial Intelligence for driving cars &amp; medical diagnosis. When he&#8217;s not thinking about Web Search (and sometimes when he is) he occasionally writes on his blog, Searching for A.I.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/8796/28796v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/8796/28796v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/8796/28796v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Infoaxe","permalink":"infoaxe","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/8780/28780v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/8780/28780v4-max-250x250.png"],[[326,125],"assets/images/resized/0002/8780/28780v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Scientist, Ranking & Search Relevance","firm":{"name":"Powerset","permalink":"powerset","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0000/3934/3934v1-max-150x150.png"],[[231,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3934/3934v1-max-250x250.png"],[[231,59],"assets/images/resized/0000/3934/3934v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonsid","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jonathansid","title":"Twitter"}]}
