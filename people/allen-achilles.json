It quickly became clear that online there was no truly safe place where children, particularly tweens, were able to find the things they wanted online without being subjected to a barrage of inappropriate content.  It was from this realization that Kidzworld.com was born. </p>\n\n<p>After nearly two years of development on February 16th, 2001 Kidzworld.com was launched. From its humble beginning Allen realized that the primary focus of kidzworld was going to be that of great content. Today the site has over 16,000 unique articles that are targeted to the 12 year old reader. There is no other website online with this depth of content for children. </p>\n\n<p>Impressively, Kidzworld.com has readers in over 100 different countries around the world and is largely regarded as one of the top sites online designed specifically for kids with over 2 Million visitors per month.
