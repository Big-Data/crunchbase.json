Delivery takes between 3-5 working days. </p>\n\n<p>No need to queue at the post office, users simply enter the details online and someone collects the parcel from their door, or a safe place of their choice if no-one is home! The courier makes three attempts to deliver the parcel at the destination, so thereâ€™s not just an annoying card left after one failed attempt. </p>\n\n<p>The price of postage is competitive, with prices starting from Â£3.49, and itâ€™s really easy for people to use. Ordering is done online, with collection and delivery of the parcels taking place door-to-door through a network of local couriers around England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p>\n\n<p>Customers can track and trace parcels online, and there is a dedicated customer services team seven days a week.</p>\n\n<p>rosie@myhermes.co.uk https://www.myhermes.co.uk</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/4064/94064v2-max-150x150.png"],[[165,165],"assets/images/resized/0009/4064/94064v2-max-250x250.png"],[[165,165],"assets/images/resized/0009/4064/94064v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
