Ravi&#8217;s very open about the lessons he&#8217;s learned, and we wrote a piece about him here a few years ago. He&#8217;s now 37. Anyway, according to the VentureWire story, Ravi does have an answer for McNamee. Next year, he plans to launch Top Shelf Capital, a hedge fund to operate from Palo Alto, and he&#8217;s doing it on a hunch that some public companies remain undervalued. He took note when publicly listed Niku had a market value of $15 million in 2002, and was then bought for $350 million in 2005.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Board","firm":{"name":"Rearden Commerce","permalink":"reardencommerce","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/2779/2779v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/2779/2779v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,144],"assets/images/resized/0000/2779/2779v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
