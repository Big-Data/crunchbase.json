Before that he stubbornly bicycled across the United States and stubbornly led Inktomi Corporationâ€™s technology team to become the biggest IPO of 1998. </p>\n\n<p>As an advisor and investor in start-up companies, Brian is not afraid to stick his neck out, only actually breaking his neck once while snowboarding. Now that he&#8217;s frequently visiting Groupon&#8217;s Chicago headquarters, Brian is open to suggestions for restaurants, aquariums, and neck-brace discount outlets.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,137],"assets/images/resized/0017/5478/175478v1-max-150x150.png"],[[142,137],"assets/images/resized/0017/5478/175478v1-max-250x250.png"],[[142,137],"assets/images/resized/0017/5478/175478v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"University of Illinois","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP Engineering","firm":{"name":"Groupon","permalink":"groupon","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-150x150.png"],[[231,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-250x250.png"],[[231,102],"assets/images/resized/0002/5604/25604v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
