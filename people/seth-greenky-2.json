He believed in me since day one. The first week I moved to NYC -he sent me on a ton of auditions-which later opened the doors for my life changing job on &#8220;All My Children&#8221;! I have the amazing life I have right now because of his belief in me. I owe him so much. Not to mention-he ALWAYS made me laugh when the going got rough!

Seth works incredibly hard, at all hours of the day. He took my phone calls at all hours of the night, and one time literally ran 80 blocks to come check on me.

He is known for making long term commitments to his clients, and goes way beyond the required efforts to bring out the best in each of them.â€\n    Vicki Roussman (Producer, VIR Productions, Winter Park, FL)</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;\n&#8220;Seth has stuck with me for 4 years now. Lots of auditions and, for me, some close calls on big roles. He believes in me with no doubt and I believe in him.
