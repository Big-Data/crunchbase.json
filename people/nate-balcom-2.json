We develop content, deliver tools for our customers, create mobile sites, run multi-scale social networking programs and basically push the boundaries of search engine optimization every day. It&#8217;s a great place to work. We have a very talented team. I&#8217;m constantly learning new things here. It&#8217;s like web development college and I&#8217;m getting my PHD in SEO.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, I&#8217;ve been designing web sites for over 11 years now. I started off in web marketing and moved into more of a graphic design position. When Macromedia&#8217;s Flash came out I became primarily a Flash Programmer/ Designer. I began working with Action script and learned Illustrator so I could manipulate vector files. I also became extremely proficient with Photoshop and did a ton of web design and high end print work.</p>\n\n<p>Later in my profession I started getting more into the heart of coding. I learned HTML, CSS, XML, DHTML and Javascript in the first few years of my programming career. I learned to code cross-browser-compatible, WC3 compliant, XHTML web sites. I began working with PHP &amp; SQL while building user forums and CMS driven web sites and e-commerce sites.</p>\n\n<p>In my spare time I run my blog NateBal.com. Stop by for web site design tutorials and social media marketing tips.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a geek at heart. I was born a .com. I love what I do. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[88,100],"assets/images/resized/0008/6397/86397v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[88,100],"assets/images/resized/0008/6397/86397v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[88,100],"assets/images/resized/0008/6397/86397v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SkODd8mBovg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>How to login to my mobile website.</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.natebal.com","title":"NateBal.com"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Website-Design-Tutorials-And-Social-Media-Marketing/418218642781","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://digg.com/users/lukeslytalker","title":"Digg"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbalcom/","title":"Flickr"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/nbalcom","title":"Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumbler/lukeslytalker/subscriptions/","title":"Stumbleupon"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/nathanbalcom","title":"Youtube"}]}
