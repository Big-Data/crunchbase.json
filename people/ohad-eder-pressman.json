He later designed software for the Israeli Air-Force&#8217;s F15 flight simulation lab, and created the top-selling Checkers and Blackjack games for the Palm, PocketPC, and Blackberry platforms. Ohad was also a core member of BeInSync&#8217;s Software-Engineering team, designing, building, and delivering the company&#8217;s UI rendering engine and synchronization algorithms, prior to its successful acquisition by Phoenix Technologies.
