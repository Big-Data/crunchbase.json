From starting a publishing company at 21 yrs old, then selling it at 24 yrs old, to working for the King of Pop himself (yes, MJ) as his personal photographer, to handling all Business Development activities for a 30 million dollar/yr digital marketing business, Ian continues to take on critical roles wherever his feet are planted.<br/>\nIan has spent the last 2 yrs with a focus on enterprise-level mobile solutions, most recently jumping into NFC commercial applications.  In 2012 Ian Barkley founded Crosscliq with his two Canadian partners Gordon Woolley and Angelo Ferrara. The founders&#8217; backgrounds in PRINT operations and manufacturing coupled with sophisticated software for coding complex tasks into the NFC tags, allows Crosscliq to position itself as one of the few in the industry to match near-field-solutions with MASS Production Print runs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/1766/181766v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0018/1766/181766v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0018/1766/181766v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Communications","institution":"University of Utah","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technology Guy","firm":{"name":"Crosscliq","permalink":"crosscliq","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/2161/182161v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0018/2161/182161v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0018/2161/182161v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://crosscliq.com","title":"Crosscliq"},{"external_url":"http://iqNFC.com","title":"IQ-NFC Software"},{"external_url":"http://ianbarkley.com","title":"Ian Barkley Personal Site"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/crosscliq","title":"Crosscliq-Twitter"}]}
