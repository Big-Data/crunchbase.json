At the Association of Women Home Owners, we offer women home owners the opportunity to learn more about their homes and the professionals who serve them. We look at the full range of home ownership from buying or building a home, to maintaining and remodeling, decorating, organizing and enjoying their homes. We help home owners identify the professionals they need to develop partnerships with, i.e. plumbers and electricians, so that they&#8217;re prepared for emergencies and confident that they know who is coming into their home.</p>\n\n<p>We offer a community for mutual learning and respect where articles are written by practicing professionals who share their first hand experience. Home owners can interact with these professionals and peer home owners to gain the knowledge and confidence to manage their homes with less stress.
