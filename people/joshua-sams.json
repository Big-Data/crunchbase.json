He actively managed investments in Turkey, speculating that there would be risk arbitrage opportunities as Turkey&#8217;s ascension to the E.U. neared. Prior to this, Joshua studied on and off at Harvard, taking time away to pursue real estate and other investments during 2001-2005. Joshua has a broad educational background, including behavioral economics and particle physics. Using the current economic crisis as a catalyst, he is now seizing the opportunity to affect social change by promoting democratic access to capital markets. Through the use of technology, he hopes to create an alternative investment banking dynamic for the benefit of early-stage companies and public investors.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Sprowtt Marketplace","permalink":"sprowtt-marketplace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/9204/49204v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0004/9204/49204v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0004/9204/49204v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
