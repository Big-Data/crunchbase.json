His techno-savvy ensures weâ€™re able to offer the best features and functionality. And, if it doesnâ€™t work properly, heâ€™s usually able to fix it. Heâ€™s often heard saying, â€œWe are all about change here. If we donâ€™t get it right the first time, weâ€™ll make it work.â€ We can ask him for anything, and he will figure out a way to make us better.</p>\n\n<p>As a youngster, Steve worked in a hardware store and spent 11 years as a dedicated volunteer firefighter. After graduating from Indiana University with a Chemistry degree in 1996, this little thing called the internet started to pop up and grow. He got a job at a small internet service provider that eventually grewâ€”and rose the ranks to chief technology officer. He then succumbed to the same love affair that Joe had with Sony, working as the director of development for Sony Music Digital in April 2001, and moved over to Sony Pictures in 2003 as the senior director of development for customer relationship management.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http://www.first30days.com/pages/about_team.html\" title=\"First30Days\" rel=\"nofollow\">First30Days</a>)</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":null,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","firm":{"name":"First30Days","permalink":"first30days","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0001/1399/11399v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0001/1399/11399v1-max-250x250.png"],[[395,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/1399/11399v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
