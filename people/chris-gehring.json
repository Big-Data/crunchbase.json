Each technology solves an important problem and each is, truly, an industry transformation. In addition, all five compliment each other and benefit from being jointly developed. Veritable demand exists for all five technologies, and that demand, coupled with the significant profit potential, provides sufficient financing for the development of new companies and international expansion.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to 2020b LLC, Chris Gehring acted as a Construction Project Manager &amp; Owner&#8217;s Representative for a wide range of prestigious organizations and individuals (ex: Stanford University, Linbeck Group, and well-known, wealthy Bay Area clients) with a proven success in meeting or exceeding project goals and delivering projects on schedule and within budget.  He excelled at interacting with broad populations including owners, clients, senior management, architects, engineers, consultants, contractors, and government agencies. He juggled multiple projects simultaneously while working under pressure in fast-paced environments.
