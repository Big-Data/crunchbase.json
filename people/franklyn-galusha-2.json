I have been doing this for over 17+ years and I really love doing what I do. To be successful at tactical marketing you have to be the type of person that is willing to comb through mountains of data, appreciate a well developed spreadsheet and be able to read between the lines to see what you need to do next. There&#8217;s no mystery in what I do it&#8217;s just grunt work not unlike and accountant and their spreadsheets.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/6764/206764v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/6764/206764v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/6764/206764v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
