I currently work as Network and System Administrator, in the past I have worked as Developer and have a great interest about these two areas. I use a lot of programming in the day-by-day of the System Administration, and believe these two areas are complements of each other. I usually maintain infrastructures using Debian or Ubuntu and like to code using dynamic languages such as Python, by the way I have no restrictions about technology nor in System Administration neither in Development. I have a good learning ability and a great troubleshooting skill.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1662/171662v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1662/171662v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1662/171662v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Arthur Furlan</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bsc","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Federal University of Paraná","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","firm":{"name":"MeCasar","permalink":"mecasar","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0017/1809/171809v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0017/1809/171809v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,166],"assets/images/resized/0017/1809/171809v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/arthurfurlan","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/arthurfurlan","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://github.com/arthurfurlan","title":"Github"},{"external_url":"http://angel.co/arthurfurlan","title":"AngelList"}]}
