He is the former CEO of Heinz UK and Ireland and well as being the former CEO of Northern Foods. Stefan is credited with building and leading the team who stabilised Northern Foods after its 2003-6 decline, before setting it up for sale to 2 Sisters Group in 2011. At Heinz he famously built the team who revived Heinz Salad Cream, with a campaign that went viral before the web was invented! His team also harmonised Heinz Tomato Ketchup across Europe into one single recipe and introduced the then innovative, now ubiquitous, ‘upside-down’ Ketchup and Salad Cream bottles. His team won over 30 marketing award including UK advertiser of the year and UK young marketer of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Stefan balances his business time with charity work, giving 10% of his time to pro-bono works; mainly associated with the Food industry. This concept was instilled in him by his parents from an early age; which he says “he didn’t really understand when he was younger, but can now see the wisdom and benefit in giving back to the society”. </p>\n\n<p>Early on in his career he was a Non-Executive Director of the charity, the British Nutrition Council. He has also been heavily involved with another charity, Business In The Community. He chaired its Yorkshire &amp; Humber Regional council from 2006 till 2010. During this time he was also HRH Prince Charles’ Ambassador to the region for 2007/8.</p>\n\n<p>At an industry level he has played a full role on the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) Executive, including leading the manufacturers’ initiatives to reduce salt (which the company he led at the time, Heinz, was credited for by name in the House of Commons). He has played a long-standing role on the leading UK food industry body, the IGD. He is proud that whichever company that he led it has worked with the government to implement recipe, packaging, waste and labelling initiatives well before they were put into legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2006 he has been an active non-Executive of IMPROVE, the Sector Skills Council for the UK food manufacturing industry. He has worked with several MPs on their projects in the food sector, focussing especially on Food Security or in ‘pub speak’, helping the most disadvantaged in society eat more cheaply and healthily.</p>\n\n<p>Stefan’s personal mission today and for many years has been “to provide society with great tasting food that is made ‘better-for-you’ and cheaper every year!” </p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Business Administration","institution":"Warwick Business School","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BSc.","subject":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","institution":"Leeds University","graduated_year":1984,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO: UK &Ireland","firm":{"name":"Heinz Inc.","permalink":"heinz-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO, UK & Ireland","firm":{"name":"Brakes Group Ltd","permalink":"brakes-group-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Northern Foods","permalink":"northern-foods","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Group MD","firm":{"name":"iForce (PE backed start-up)","permalink":"iforce-pe-backed-start-up","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"General Manger: Grocery","firm":{"name":"Iceland Frozen Foods Ltd.","permalink":"iceland-frozen-foods-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"European Category Director: Ketchup and Sauces","firm":{"name":"Heinz","permalink":"heinz","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Consultant","firm":{"name":"McKinsey.","permalink":"mckinsey-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://results.racetectiming.com/MyResults.aspx?CId=38&RId=359&EId=1&AId=143362","title":"Stefan Barden Henley on Thames Triathlon results"},{"external_url":"http://www.eurocheddar.com/2012/09/19/profiles-in-business-an-interview-with-stefan-barden/","title":"Profiles in Business: an Interview with Stefan Barden"},{"external_url":"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=22508314&ticker=HNZ&previousCapId=877270&previousTitle=Brake%20Bros%20Limited","title":"Stefan Barden on Bloomberg Businessweek"},{"external_url":"http://improveltd.co.uk/board","title":"Stefan Barden on Improve - Food & Drink skills councel"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.4networking.biz/Members/Details/87008","title":"Stefan Barden 4networking profile"}]}
