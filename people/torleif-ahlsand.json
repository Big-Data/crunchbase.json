Several people have described him as an energetic Jack of all Trades; a business person, a research scientist and an extremely competitive sportsman. &#8220;But I still want to be really, really good at what I do, and that requires attitude, passion and hard work&#8221;, says Torleif Ahlsand reflectively. &#8220;In Northzone I&#8217;m free to play on everything in my background and personality; I&#8217;m loving it.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Torleif joined Northzone in 2000 after a selection process that might well be used as a blueprint for Northzone&#8217;s own investment process. Prior to Northzone, Torleif was VP of Corporate Finance in Handelsbanken Capital Markets and a corporate development executive - which is companese for &#8220;the M&amp;A Business Strategy-guy&#8221; - in Orkla ASA. Torleif also has a professional technical background as a research scientist at CERN outside Geneva (&#8220;that&#8221;, he remarks, &#8220;was rocket-science stuff&#8221;) and as a telecommunications engineer in Nera ASA.</p>\n\n<p>What about the sportsman side? Outside the office, you&#8217;re most likely to find Torleif exploring new limits in hard-core activities such as rock-climbing, kiting, MTB, kayaking, or - as one would suspect from a Norwegian - skiing. He is former Nordic student champion in Skiathlon, and continues to place among the top 1% in cross-country races like Vasaloppet and Birkebeiner&#8217;n. Probably the best VC skier out there!</p>\n\n<p>Torleif holds a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from NTNU (1991) and an MBA with Honours from IMD in Switzerland (1997).</p>\n\n<p>Torleif serves as Chairman of the Board of Funcom, Colibria, and Orecon and as Director in Nimsoft and Imagini. He has also served as Director in Tinde, Intility and Photonyx.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0002/9649/29649v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0002/9649/29649v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0002/9649/29649v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
