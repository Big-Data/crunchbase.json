His monologues include last seasonâ€™s critically acclaimed If You See Something Say Something, the controversial How Theater Failed America, the six-hour epic Great Men of Genius, the unrepeatable series All Stories Are Fiction, and the international sensation 21 Dog Years. He has performed in venues on five continents, ranging from Off-Broadway at the Public Theater to remote islands in the South Pacific, from the Sydney Opera House to abandoned theaters in post-Communist Tajikistan. Heâ€™s been a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, as well as a commentator and contributor to WIRED, Vanity Fair, Slate, Salon, NPR and the BBC. His first film, Layover, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival this year, and a feature film of his monologue If You See Something Say Something is currently in post production.  His second book, Rough Magic, a collected anthology of his monologues, will be published in 2011. He has been nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Award, two Drama League Awards, and is the recipient of the Bay Area Critics Circle Award, four Seattle Times Footlight Awards, the Sloan Foundationâ€™s Galileo Prize, and a MacDowell Fellowship. He lives in New York with his wife and collaborator Jean-Michele Gregory.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0011/9766/119766v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0011/9766/119766v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0011/9766/119766v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Kevin Berne</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
