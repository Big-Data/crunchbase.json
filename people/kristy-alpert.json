She quickly fell in love with Portland on a weekend trip, and relocated with her husband and her Boston Terrier, Tobias (affectionately named after her favorite Arrested Development character). Although she still gets excited every time it rains and has developed a slight obsession with Mt. Hood, sheâ€™s no rookie when it comes to uncovering Portlandâ€™s definitive style. A freelance writer/editor who happily works from her home office, Kristy has bylines in D Magazine, Omni Escapes, Home Comfort Style, Oregon Bride, among others. But the best part about working from home is that she can wail on her African percussion instruments as loud as she wants and her neighbors are never the wiser.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Contributor","firm":{"name":"Neighborhood Notes","permalink":"neighborhood-notes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.neighborhoodnotes.com/author/Kristy%20Alpert/","title":"Neighborhood Notes Blog"}]}
