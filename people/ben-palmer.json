It is exactly these values that I try to bring to my work as a realtor. A lifelong Oakville area resident, I attended McMaster University where I earned two degrees, my B.A. in psychology and my B.Sc. in biology. Afterwards, I felt a change was needed and I put my energy into the real estate business.</p>\n\n<p>My focus on timeless values and their application to my career have been the key to my success as a real estate professional.
