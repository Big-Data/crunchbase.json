If you work for a charity or non-profit we would love to increase awareness about your efforts.</p>\n\n<p>With the newly revamped No More Poverty website you can fill out and apply for a grant with ease. All you have to do is tell us about your organization or cause, tell us how we can help, and tell us how we can contact you.</p>\n\n<p>We have provided support to several charities already and are looking to expand into business development in disenfranchised areas as well as other helpful campaigns. Please visit the No More Poverty website and tell us how we can help you in your efforts to end poverty. </p>\n\n<p>Michael and his brother Julian Omidi are incredibly proud of the work we are doing to combat poverty through No More Poverty, and we are very thankful for the amazing charities that we have worked with and continue to work with.</p>\n\n<p>They are especially thankful for all of their kind words supporting us. It is such a privilege to work with charities that really aid in the fight against poverty such as Drop in the Bucket, Children’s Hunger Fund, Simone’s Kids, and Create Now.</p>\n\n<p>The work is far from over, however, and we need your involvement with our organization. Suggestions, “Likes,” ideas, and more are welcomed by us on our Facebook page. Please help those who really need it by participating in these campaigns. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/8164/218164v2-max-150x150.png"],[[174,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/8164/218164v2-max-250x250.png"],[[314,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/8164/218164v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Michael Omidi</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"No More Poverty","permalink":"no-more-poverty","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.drmichaelomidi.com/","title":"Michael Omidi"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/MichaelOmidi1","title":"Michael Omidi Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dr-michael-omidi/45/72/573","title":"Michael Omidi Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://www.omidimd.com/","title":"Dr. Michael Omidi Professional"},{"external_url":"http://www.michaelomidi.com/","title":"Dr. Michael Omidi Blog"}]}
