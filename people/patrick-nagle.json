Later that year, Nagle and DeSantis launched their first startup SwitchTextbooks.com.</p>\n\n<p>SwitchTextbooks.com was a way for college students to trade textbooks. At the age of 24, Nagle later raised over $1,000,000 in angel funding to buy RateMyProfessors.com from Menlo Park, California programmer John Swapceinski.</p>\n\n<p>SwitchTextbooks.com was abandoned due financial limitations and as a result of RateMyProfessor.com&#8217;s exponential growth. Nagle and DeSantis still own the Patent to SwtchTextbooks.com: â€œInternet Textbook Exchange&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Although undisclosed, it is rumored that the Viacom acquisition of RateMyProfessors.com in 2007 was in the low eight figures. At the time of acquisition, RateMyProfessors.com reached over 10-million college students.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 Patrick Nagle left Viacom&#8217;s MTVu and teamed-up with Matias de Tezanos to acquire the high school equivalent of RateMyProfessors.com from Bakersfield, California based Mister Message LLC. The legality of the RateMyTeachers acquisition was initially in dispute by former Mister Message, LLC associate Michael Hussey. Hussey and Nagle settled out of court on November 19, 2009. RateMyTeachers.com boasts over 20-million users per year.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally in 2008, Nagle and Kenneth Clash acquired and re-branded NiggaSpace.com as OurSpace.com, which was visited over 7-million times. OurSpace.com&#8217;s mission was to become the leading online urban social network. OurSpace.com was redirected to MySpace.com in 2010. Whois records report that OurSpace.com is owned by MySpace.com, LLC.</p>\n\n<p>Patrick is currently involved with: RateMyTeachers.com, ChicEngine.com, Likeability.com, Net30Now.com, LeadNames.com and several successful/unsuccessful startups and domains.   </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0011/0047/110047v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0011/0047/110047v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0011/0047/110047v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Patrick Nagle</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Net30Now.com","permalink":"net30now-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor/Advisor","firm":{"name":"RateMyTeachers.com","permalink":"ratemyteachers-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Ratemyprofessor.com","permalink":"ratemyprofessor-om","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0009/7496/97496v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[238,75],"assets/images/resized/0009/7496/97496v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[238,75],"assets/images/resized/0009/7496/97496v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"SwitchTextbooks.com","permalink":"switchtextbooks-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investor","firm":{"name":"OurSpace.com","permalink":"ourspace-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Ewallstreeter.com","permalink":"ewallstreeter-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0010/8111/108111v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0010/8111/108111v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0010/8111/108111v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Created and wrote patent \"Internet Book Exchange\" - 20070033112","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":8,"source_url":"http://www.uspto.gov","source_text":null,"source_description":"Patent","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Nagle","permalink":"patrick-nagle"}}],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OJMpC4tuq1s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OJMpC4tuq1s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":""}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2006/04/17/story8.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2007/01/29/story12.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/education/edlife/revisit.html","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/09/68941?currentPage=2","title":""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pat.nagle","title":""},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Nagle","title":""}]}
