In 1999, Craig retired from IT consulting to work full-time on craigslist. What started as a fun side project in Craig&#8217;s living room has since grown into one of the busiest sites on the internet, helping people with basic day-to-day needs such as finding a job, an apartment and a date, all within a culture of trust.</p>\n\n<p>Craig continues to embrace his inner nerd though he no longer wears thick black glasses that are held together with tape, and he retired the plastic pocket protector some years ago. </p>\n\n<p>Craig is involved with a variety of community efforts and is particularly interested in organizations promoting public diplomacy, mideast peace and new forms of media such as participatory journalism. He&#8217;s on the boards of Sunlight Foundation, OneVoice, FactCheckED, and VotoLatino.</p>\n\n<p>Craig graduated from Case Western University.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://www.craigslist.org/about/craig.newmark.html\" title=\"craigslist\" rel=\"nofollow\">craigslist</a>)</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[117,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/3900/13900v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[141,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/3900/13900v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[141,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/3900/13900v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Customer Service Rep","firm":{"name":"Craigslist","permalink":"craigslist","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-150x150.png"],[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-250x250.png"],[[127,39],"assets/images/resized/0001/2301/12301v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"investor","firm":{"name":"Daylife","permalink":"daylife","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/4516/14516v1-max-150x150.png"],[[126,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/4516/14516v1-max-250x250.png"],[[126,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/4516/14516v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Advisors","firm":{"name":"DonorsChoose.org","permalink":"donorschoose-org","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,22],"assets/images/resized/0000/0487/487v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/0487/487v3-max-250x250.png"],[[269,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/0487/487v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"LendforPeace.org","permalink":"lend-for-peace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0004/2131/42131v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0004/2131/42131v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,170],"assets/images/resized/0004/2131/42131v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Sunlight Foundation","permalink":"sunlight-foundation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0012/4125/124125v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0012/4125/124125v2-max-250x250.png"],[[360,163],"assets/images/resized/0012/4125/124125v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisory Board Member","firm":{"name":"Wikimedia Foundation","permalink":"wikimedia-foundation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[143,143],"assets/images/resized/0001/6361/16361v2-max-150x150.png"],[[143,143],"assets/images/resized/0001/6361/16361v2-max-250x250.png"],[[143,143],"assets/images/resized/0001/6361/16361v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Named one of Time Magazine's top 25 most influential people on the web (2008)","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/09/0929_most_influential/1.htm","source_text":"","source_description":"The 25 Most Influential People on the Web","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Newmark","permalink":"craig-newmark"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/craignewmark","title":"twitter"}]}
