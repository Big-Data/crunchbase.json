Andrew has also participated in the design of 802.11b/Bluetooth transceivers (with Mobilian), graphics chips (with SGI), digital cinema CODECs (with Qualcomm), and autonomous robotic submarines (with MIT ORCA/AUVSI).</p>\n\n<p>He is also responsible for the un-design of many security systems, with an appetite for the challenge of digesting silicon-based hardware security. Andrew is also a contributing writer for MAKE magazine and a member of their technical advisory board. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/6008/16008v2-max-150x150.png"],[[122,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/6008/16008v2-max-250x250.png"],[[122,91],"assets/images/resized/0001/6008/16008v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Ph.D","subject":"Electrical Engineering","institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP Hardware Engineering and Founder","firm":{"name":"Chumby","permalink":"chumby","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0000/2803/2803v1-max-150x150.png"],[[173,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/2803/2803v1-max-250x250.png"],[[173,50],"assets/images/resized/0000/2803/2803v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
