His parents raised him to acknowledge everyone as equals, especially the less fortunate such as the homeless and the poor. When a tornado destroyed Wooten&#8217;s home, the incident ignited the passion within him to serve others.</p>\n\n<p>Wooten juggles his work in real estate and entertainment with his musical prowess and creativity. He volunteers at the Bread and Roses CafÃ© where his influence as a musician is appreciated as he organizes benefit concerts for the establishment. When not volunteering, working, or playing music, Wooten relaxes by reading books, and watching television shows and movies. </p>\n\n<p>Additional information about his volunteer work is available at http://www.stjosephctr.org/documents/AnnualReport08-09StJosephCenter.pdf</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2361/152361v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/2361/152361v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0015/2361/152361v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
