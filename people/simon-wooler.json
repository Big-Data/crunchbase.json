He regularly networks with fellow professionals in the UK and US to share experiences and keep his knowledge bang up-to-date as well as regularly blogging on dog training issues.</p>\n\n<p>He has a particular interest in working with rescue dogs and dogs with fear and aggression problems, stemming from his own experience with a deeply troubled rescue Rottweiler, Thomson. </p>\n\n<p>Simon’s career was originally as a sound engineer, but he gave it up as it involved pitifully few dogs. He now shares his life with rescue Rottie Murphy, spaniel Woody and two cats – Oscar and Frankie. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
