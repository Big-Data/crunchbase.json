With respect to the academia I achieved an MSc in E-Commerce with Distinction from Kingston University and I was also awarded a prize for the best MSc E-Commerce student. From the working world I was already involved in the development and implementation of two major e-business systems, at PricewaterhouseCoopers and KONNEKT. I believe that through my working experience, my involvement in student organisations and the academic degrees I can show that I have the required skills, the required commitment and the right amount of determination to continue moving forward. I look forward to share my experiences and knowledge with colleagues and partners to achieve results and reach targets.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=34572880&locale=en_US&trk=tab_pro","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
