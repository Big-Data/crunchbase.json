He typically writes lots of code with Visual Studio and the popular language he does this in is C#. He also likes SQL. It doesn&#8217;t matter much which flavour of SQL as it&#8217;s fairly standard and that&#8217;s what he loves about it. Perhaps it&#8217;s obvious, but Josh thinks MSSQL is pretty cool.</p>\n\n<p>Josh likes to write code for business. He&#8217;s doing his best to model himself into a business optimization person. What&#8217;s that mean? That means he takes business process and makes it cheaper to run. It also means he creates a way to measure the improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Josh is a signatory to the Agile Manifesto and loves working with Lean methodologies in regards to software.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/8642/198642v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/8642/198642v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/8642/198642v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
