The core focus of Gynzy is to create easy-to-use software that enables teachers to truly start using interactive whiteboards as an integral part of their teaching. Before Gynzy, Rutger in 2001 co-founded the Internet games company Zylom which - with 25 million monthly unique visitors - was the leading Internet games destination in Europe for women playing games. Zylom was acquired in 2006 by RealNetworks (RNWK) after which Rutger became Vice President of Worldwide Revenue until leaving in early 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Rutger tries to help foundations in the Education space such as e-Learning for Kids (www.e-learningforkids.org) and BizWorld because he believes that the positive impact the Internet and technology can play in teaching kids is untapped and needs to become much more dominant.
