This entrepreneurial effort led to nine additional Internet based start-ups spanning from the fitness industry to commercial television and online web business solutions while building partnerships with companies such as Yahoo, Comcast, and Peer1.  While studying business administration and psychology, he expanded his skills beyond business planning and development to include hands on technical experience through advanced search engine optimization, network architecture and administration, and the management, design, and development of over one hundred online destinations.  Marcus joined the team in January of 2007 to focus on business development and SEO initiatives.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/1599/61599v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/1599/61599v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,300],"assets/images/resized/0006/1599/61599v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Marcus Flemming / <a href=\"http://www.savings.com\" title=\"Savings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Savings.com</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Business Development & SEO","firm":{"name":"Savings.com","permalink":"savings-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,58],"assets/images/resized/0002/6180/26180v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,97],"assets/images/resized/0002/6180/26180v5-max-250x250.png"],[[350,137],"assets/images/resized/0002/6180/26180v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
