But looking back, I can&#8217;t say that I regret keeping my music as an off-hours thing. I find life with Northzone truly amazing. There&#8217;s a unique freedom in thought and an intellectual flexibility here. And everybody is genuinely interested in what they do.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Stineï¿½s task within Northzone is a formidable one; being in charge of the Investor Relations function, general administration and financial control. Or in other words: she is the one who keeps the creative chaos in order. At Northzone it takes one to know one, hence, Stineï¿½s position is perhaps the most creative of them all.</p>\n\n<p>No one would be better prepared for the task, however. Stine&#8217;s artistic background has already been mentioned. Furthermore, she holds an MBA in Finance from the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration in Bergen, Norway. Her skills have been well documented in her previous positions as CFO with Tele Danmark, InterNordia and as a Due Diligence Manager with PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/9653/29653v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0002/9653/29653v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0002/9653/29653v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO/Partner","firm":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
