Soon after buying a house in Calistoga, we found the Bennett Lane property.â€</p>\n\n<p>A combination of keen business acumen and an audacious attitude of â€œwhen the going gets tough,â€ is what gave Randy Lynch the wherewithal to grow RW Lynch Company (http://www.rwlynch.com), an advertising agency he started more than 25 years ago.  A pioneer in its field, the RW Lynch Company was the first to successfully sell group television advertising.  â€œWe started selling group advertising to lawyers in 1984 with the Injury Helpline,â€ (http://www.injuryhelplineattorney.com) he says.</p>\n\n<p>A Danville, California native, Randyâ€™s memories of the Napa Valley date back to the 1950â€™s and 60â€™s when he would water-ski at Clear Lake.  â€œThe valley was dairy farms and orchards,â€ comments Randy.  â€œIâ€™ve always had a passion for agriculture.  When Lisa and I decided to buy a second home some years ago, I knew I wanted to own a vineyard and grow grapesâ€•and be able to enjoy the fruits of our labor,â€ he says.</p>\n\n<p>While Randy and Lisa could have easily purchased vineyard property in nearby Livermore, they chose Napa because their favorite wines are Cabernet Sauvignons from the Napa Valley,  â€œI take this business very seriously, and Napa produces the best Cabernet fruit in the country,â€ notes Randy.  Currently, Randy and Lisa split time between Danville and their home in Calistoga, and as soon as their children graduate from high school (together they have five), theyâ€™ll live in Calistoga full time.</p>\n\n<p>Randy Lynch has often found success in taking the road less traveled, and under his leadership, Bennett Lane Winery is the first to attempt to target sports fansâ€•specifically race car fansâ€•as a viable consumer market for premium wine.  A long-time racing aficionado and race car driver himself, in June 2004, Bennett Lane Winery (http://www.bennettlane.com) was the first California winery to sponsor a Nextel Cup car in NASCAR.  Randy teamed with driver P.J. Jones as Bennett Laneâ€™s Dodge joined 42 of Americaâ€™s top cars in the grueling, high-speed, 100-lap NASCAR race at Infineon Raceway, located at the gateway to northern California wine country.  Bennett Lane continues to be the only winery to own a NASCAR team.  â€œWine is something I came into later in life, but racing is something Iâ€™ve been involved with since I was a teenager,â€ said Randy (http://www.lynchracing.com).  â€œIt is very exciting to blend my two passions right here among the vines.â€  While Bennett Laneâ€™s goal in tapping this market is to change â€œbeer drinkers to wine drinkers one race at a time,â€ itâ€™s safe to say this California winery is on the fast track.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/2420/52420v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0005/2420/52420v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0005/2420/52420v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.rwlynch.com","title":"RW Lynch Company, Inc."},{"external_url":"http://www.injuryhelplineattorney.com","title":"Injury Helpline Attorney"},{"external_url":"http://www.injuryhelplinelawyer.com","title":"Injury Helpline Lawyer"}]}
