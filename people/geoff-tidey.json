He likes to shepherd electrons.</p>\n\n<p>Geoff has been working as a computer professional for almost 20 years.  After leaving university his first job was &#8220;hacking&#8221; medical databases using a hex editor and lots of C.  He went on to work for the first ever dedicated sports TV company, SiS Ltd.  Here he honed the craft of C with real-time gambling software, whilst also learning C++ &amp; .net technologies amongst others.  After releasing numerous multi-million pound systems, over many years, he decided that he wanted a new challenge and left to become an iPhone programmer.<br/>\nAfter a few weeks of starting his first app he spoke to an old friend, Mark Spofforth, about an idea he had for a social platform for food &amp; drink.  From this the seeds of lovefre.sh were sown.  Geoff is now happy programming objective-C &amp; Ruby on Rails with a bit of magic sprinkled in for good measure from the rest of the lovefre.sh team.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSc(HONS)","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"De Montfort","graduated_year":1994,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO & Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Lovefre.sh","permalink":"lovefre-sh","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/6861/136861v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/6861/136861v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/6861/136861v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
