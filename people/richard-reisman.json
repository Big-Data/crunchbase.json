He has always been oriented to connectivity &#8211; powerful interactive tools and media for human communication, collaboration, knowledge work, commerce, and entertainment.  Reisman has worked in a variety of technology and business roles, including as developer, consultant, and manager, and more recently as entrepreneur and inventor.  He has been developing a number of patent portfolios relating to media and e-business technologies, both directly and through strategic partners, and has more than a dozen issued patents and a couple dozen more pending.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2010 Reisman began development of FairPay, a radical approach to pricing for digital media content. FairPay develops a buyer reputation based on Internet feedback, to go beyond &#8220;freemium,&#8221; to an adaptive hybrid of free and paid content.  Another current focus of direct activity is on the development of CoTVâ„¢, coactive television, a power assist for the growing trend toward simultaneous, or â€œcoactive,â€ use of TV and the Web (first patents issued 2011).  CoTVâ„¢ creates a powerful new compound medium that combines the full power of both (on 1, 2, or 3-screens).  Other current areas of independent development and patent filings include data exchange for product usage data and ratings (first patent issued 2008), digital media storage management (first patent issued 2010), and The Idea Adoption Agency (communities/marketplaces for collaborative innovation and idea development).  </p>\n\n<p>His first patent portfolios was developed in partnership with BTG International, a leading technology commercialization and licensing firm, and seven additional patents that strengthen that portfolio were awarded in 2000-2010.  That led to patent infringement suits against Microsoft and Apple in 2004, and in 2006 these patents were sold for a down payment of $35 million. These patents are now controlled by Intellectual Ventures.  His second important portfolio of patents relates to search, with four patents issued in 2005-08.  This portfolio was sold in 2009 to RPX Corporation, the first defensive patent aggregator.</p>\n\n<p>Teleshuttle develops new media and business technologies and also provides strategic consulting services for media and electronic business. Clients have included Dow Jones, News Corporation/TVGuide, IDD Information Services, and AppliedTheory Communications, as well as key players in intellectual property development.  Reisman founded Teleshuttle in 1994 as an online software/service provider based on one of his inventions. Teleshuttle&#8217;s most widely known product was the online update service that was integrated with the Blockbuster Video Guide To Movies &amp; Videos CD-ROM to provide updates on newly released films. This invention has taken new life in Blue-ray BD-Live services.</p>\n\n<p>Reisman also served during the dot-com boom as founding CTO and Managing Director, Operations and Technology for HealthSCOUT.com, an innovative Web-based B2B2C health information service. There, he delivered Web services through syndicated co-brand affiliations with hundreds of Web sites, including CompuServe, Prodigy, Yahoo!, Earthlink, Dr. Koop, iVillage, Snap, iWon, USA Today, Knight-Ridder, Scripps, Phys (Conde-Nast), BeWell (HealthGate), Physicians Online, and through insurance sites, including Harvard Pilgrim and the US Government, managing a staff of 25+ and budget of $5+ million. (details)</p>\n\n<p>In the early &#8217;90s, Reisman made technology and entrepreneurial contributions to a variety of online and new media developments.  As co-founder of UNET, he developed the original versions of TV Guide Online (through consumer beta test) in a joint venture with News Corp. At BASELINE (since acquired by The New York Times), he developed pioneering consumer online services, as well as online information services to the film and TV industry. </p>\n\n<p>His earlier work was in large enterprise IT environments, focused on leading-edge development in such areas as interactive systems, online networks, and database search.  Varied roles in IT and information services included management, consulting, planning, development, and operations.  He directed electronic distribution operations for financial data for McGraw-Hill / Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and managed strategy, planning, and operations for a very broad variety of major computer and telecom services at Mobil Corporation and AT&amp;T, starting out as a software developer.  </p>\n\n<p>A finalist for the Multi-Media Entrepreneur of 1995 award from the Silicon Alley Initiative, Reisman has spoken widely, and written for a variety of trade publications. He serves as an Executive Board member of the MIT Enterprise Forum of NYC, for whom he has organized numerous symposia, was an ACM National Lecturer, and holds an AB from Brown University and an MS from Lehigh University.   </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/1325/151325v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[177,236],"assets/images/resized/0015/1325/151325v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[177,236],"assets/images/resized/0015/1325/151325v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Taylor Hooper /(http://www.headshots-newyork.com/)</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Teleshuttle","permalink":"teleshuttle","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0014/8089/148089v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,42],"assets/images/resized/0014/8089/148089v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[326,55],"assets/images/resized/0014/8089/148089v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-reisman/0/44/508","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
