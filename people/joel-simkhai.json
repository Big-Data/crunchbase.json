In 1998, he attended Tufts University, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in a double major of International Relations and Economics. Joel then went on to work in several different fields, from finance to a news desk to a start-up, before starting his own Internet marketing firm in 2003. After establishing his business, Joel decided to move to Los Angeles for a change of scenery in March 2008. It was here in 2008 that the capability for Joel to create Grindr occurred. </p>\n\n<p>Throughout his life and career, Joel had always been looking for a better way to meet the people around him. After countless missed connections and lost opportunities, he decided there must be a better way to find new people and friends around. With the announcement of the second-generation iPhone, combining GPS technology and application development for the mobile platform, the pieces came together and created the perfect combination to achieve Joel&#8217;s idea. In March 2009, Grindr was launched and has been going strong ever since. </p>\n\n<p>Joel currently resides in Los Angeles.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/2440/122440v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/2440/122440v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/2440/122440v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Grindr","permalink":"grindr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/9349/39349v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9349/39349v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/9349/39349v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Blendr","permalink":"blendr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/6174/166174v2-max-150x150.png"],[[221,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/6174/166174v2-max-250x250.png"],[[398,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/6174/166174v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
