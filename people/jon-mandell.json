Unfortunately, Florida&#8217;s insurance industry introduced state legislation which provided much of the same services as Preferred Wellness, paving the way for Jon&#8217;s migration to New York City. </p>\n\n<p>Jon&#8217;s desire to build companies that make a daily difference in people&#8217;s lives led him to join the PubSub Concepts team in 2005. There he used his experience and skills in guiding the fledgling corporation&#8217;s operations, finance, marketing and business development. </p>\n\n<p>Jon holds a degree in Business Administration from the University of Central Florida in Orlando and has a healthy obsession with technology.
