Believing in the future of videogames, Doug joined Electronic Arts in the early 90â€™s as a product development executive where, during his 3 years there, the company grew from less than $100M to over $400M in revenues. He then founded an entertainment software company which he sold to Turner Broadcasting (now Time Warner) where he became Senior VP/GM of Turner New Media and managed the division&#8217;s online, videogame, interactive TV and licensing businesses. Realizing the power of the Internet, Doug left Turner to become President/Services of an Internet TV startup, Navio Communications (later Liberate), which went public for over $1 billion in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>At Selby, Doug focuses on digital media, Internet and mobile investments and has worked with numerous innovative startups including Panopticon (www.kana.com), a seed stage personalization ecommerce company acquired for over $100M, Pandora Media (www.pandora.com), an Internet radio service with over 4 million monthly listeners and Bigfix (www.bigfix.com), a next generation software/services company. He was also previously a consultant to TIVO (www.tivo.com), and advisor to Glumobile (www.glumobile.com), a leader in mobile gaming.</p>\n\n<p>Doug has brought his vision and passion to the philanthropic world as well, where as a 5 year advisor to Grameen Foundation (www.gfusa.org), a leading microfinance organization, he has helped raise millions of dollars from Silicon Valley. Grameen Bankâ€™s founder, Professor Muhammad Yunus, won the Nobel Peace Prize this year.</p>\n\n<p>Doug received his B.S. from U.C. Berkeley (where he was also a concert promoter) and an MBA from Harvard University. Doug is married with 4 children and enjoys music, skiing, tennis, and spending time with his family.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/0217/30217v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[130,169],"assets/images/resized/0003/0217/30217v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[130,169],"assets/images/resized/0003/0217/30217v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Harvard ","graduated_year":1991,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Selby Venture Partners","permalink":"selby-venture-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0001/5071/15071v1-max-150x150.png"],[[162,127],"assets/images/resized/0001/5071/15071v1-max-250x250.png"],[[162,127],"assets/images/resized/0001/5071/15071v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder Investor/Board","firm":{"name":"Pandora Media","permalink":"pandora","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-150x150.png"],[[152,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-250x250.png"],[[152,37],"assets/images/resized/0000/3394/3394v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investor/Board Member","firm":{"name":"BigFix","permalink":"bigfix","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/2294/92294v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0009/2294/92294v1-max-250x250.png"],[[400,90],"assets/images/resized/0009/2294/92294v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
