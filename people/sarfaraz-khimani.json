It offers search engine optimization, paid search marketing, social media marketing and conversion rate improvement services, guided by in-house Web Analytics and campaign management programs. As one of the three founding members of Convonix Inc., Sarfaraz looks after the management of overseas client relations and acquisitions, long-term strategy planning and improving processes, over all the service verticals. </p>\n\n<p>Before getting all-hands into Convonix, Sarfaraz took time off from the company to pursue business management studies.  After receiving a Post Graduate Diploma in Management from Indian Institute of Management studies, Kolkata (IIM â€“C), one of Indiaâ€™s top business schools, he joined J P Morgan - a leading financial services firm with global scale and reach - as an Analyst in the Investment Banking division. His key role at the firm required him to deal with financial analysis and acquisitions, including equity link transactions, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) and IPOs. Seven months into the firm, Sarfaraz decided to switch gears and move to Convonix full time. </p>\n\n<p>Sarfaraz believes his significant achievement is having co-created a firm that increased the value-proposition of â€˜an India based SEO firmâ€™; now one of Indiaâ€™s best and top rated internet marketing firms.
