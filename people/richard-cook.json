Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International passed the one billion dollar mark for 12 consecutive years, the only distribution company to have achieved this milestone.  To date, the Studio has released 54 films that have grossed more than $100 million each domestically.  No other studio has accomplished this extraordinary feat.</p>\n\n<p>During his tenure, Cook has overseen such box-office successes as â€œPirates of the Caribbean: At Worldâ€™s End,â€ which broke industry wide records with the highest global opening at over $404 million, â€œPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Manâ€™s Chest,â€ the highest grossing film in Disney history with over a billion dollars at the worldwide box office, â€œRatatouille,â€ â€œCars,â€ â€œThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,â€ â€œChicken Little,â€ â€˜National Treasure,â€ â€œThe Incredibles,â€ â€œPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Manâ€™s Chest,â€ â€œFinding Nemo,â€ â€œLilo &amp; Stitch, â€œ â€œRemember the Titans,â€ â€œSigns,â€ â€œArmageddon,â€ â€œThe Santa Clause,â€ â€œPrincess Diaries,â€ â€œPearl Harbor,â€ among many others.</p>\n\n<p>With Cook at the helm, the Studio has attracted some of the most powerful as well as diverse producers and directors in the industry including Jerry Bruckheimer, Scott Rudin, John Lasseter, Robert Zemeckis, Tony Scott, Lasse Hallstrom, Wes Anderson, Army Bernstein, Gore Verbinski, Walter Salles and Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy among others.</p>\n\n<p>Cook has enjoyed success in the area of Home Entertainment as well.
