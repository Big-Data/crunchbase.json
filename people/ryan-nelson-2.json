He is adept at designing and leading targeted well-being initiatives and development programs.</p>\n\n<p>He has worked within the Benefits/HR department at Healthways, the largest global Well-being Improvement company.  His primary objective was to transform their own HQ into a beacon of Colleague Well-being.  This meant focusing on different Colleague health programs aimed at increasing awareness, engagement, participation, and screening scores, all while decreasing costs, confusion, and clutter.  To complete this objective, he partnered with others across the company and together they were able to effect change in the organization and it&#8217;s Colleague population.  In under 8 months, he developed and co-managed a successful onsite fitness program, partnered with others to create a leadership development program aimed at leading well-being, re-designed communication strategies with physical space in mind, and consolidated several wellness initiatives under one umbrella brand.  He also produced his own cycling brand internally, which resulted in Healthways receiving Honors from the American League of Bicyclists.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, he is finishing his M.Ed. at Vanderbilt University, while consulting with several companies in Nashville.  He is also working with a few start-ups in an strategic planning and leadership advisory role.</p>\n\n<p>Quote: &#8220;Basically, I enjoy helping people live healthier, more fulfilled, and happier lives.&#8221; </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5551/155551v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[234,234],"assets/images/resized/0015/5551/155551v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[234,234],"assets/images/resized/0015/5551/155551v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Double Major: Psychology & Humanities Classics","institution":"Ohio Wesleyan University","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"M.Ed.","subject":"Organizational Leadership","institution":"Vanderbilt University, Peabody College of Education","graduated_year":2012,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Colleague Well-Being & Benefits","firm":{"name":"Healthways","permalink":"healthways","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0007/4899/74899v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[171,43],"assets/images/resized/0007/4899/74899v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[171,43],"assets/images/resized/0007/4899/74899v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Consultant","firm":{"name":"Vanderbilt Medical Group","permalink":"vanderbilt-medical-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"International Division","firm":{"name":"Central Japan Railway Company","permalink":"central-japan-railway-company","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Consultant","firm":{"name":"Dollar General Corporation","permalink":"dollar-general-corporation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0020/7923/207923v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0020/7923/207923v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[330,109],"assets/images/resized/0020/7923/207923v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing","firm":{"name":"QHR (Quorum Health Resources)","permalink":"qhr-quorum-health-resources","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/nelsonrw","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Rwnelson321","title":"Facebook"}]}
