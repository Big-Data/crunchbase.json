One year later he moved onto a tech startup in Leicester Square called Fizzback who specialise in large scale consumer feedback.</p>\n\n<p>After deciding that working in the city is not much fun, Matt left England to work in South Korea as an English teacher. During this year abroad Matt got talking to his good friend Mark Spofforth and became closely involved in the initial developement of Lovefre.sh. When he returned to the U.K he started working for Lovefre.sh full time as Creative Director.</p>\n\n<p>Matt enjoys doodling, thunderstorms, social computer games and noodling over nice pieces of design and typography. He frequently spends too much time reading online, and has a very lovely wife who doesn&#8217;t gripe when he crawls into bed at 2 a.m after a tea and internet binge.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Ba(Hons)","subject":"Graphic Design","institution":"Arts University College Bournemouth","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Director","firm":{"name":"Lovefre.sh","permalink":"lovefre-sh","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/6861/136861v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/6861/136861v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/6861/136861v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Graphic Designer","firm":{"name":"The Fizzback Group","permalink":"the-fizzback-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,127],"assets/images/resized/0007/8437/78437v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[161,137],"assets/images/resized/0007/8437/78437v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[161,137],"assets/images/resized/0007/8437/78437v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"In house designer","firm":{"name":"Maya London","permalink":"maya-london","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/Boylee_ps","title":"Matt on twitter"},{"external_url":"http://theboyle.co.uk","title":"Online Portfolio"}]}
