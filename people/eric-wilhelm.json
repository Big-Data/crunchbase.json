Wilhelm, Ph.D. is the Co-founding partner of Squid Labs and CEO of Instructables.  Instructables is a website, created by Eric in 2005, specializing in user-created and uploaded do-it-yourself projects, which other users can comment on and rate for quality. Instructables is dedicated to step-by-step collaboration among members to build a variety of projects. Users post instructions to their projects, usually accompanied by visual aids, and then interact through comment sections below each Instructable step as well in topic forums.</p>\n\n<p>Eric earned his SB, SM, and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from MIT, where he developed methods to print electronics and micro-electromechanical systems using nanoparticles. Eric co-founded Squid Labs in order to have impact through early-stage innovation. He spun Instructables out of Squid Labs as an independent company, which he now runs with a passion. He loves building kite-powered contraptions, cooking breakfast, and demystifying technology so that even his Grandmother can use it.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[69,69],"assets/images/resized/0015/2787/152787v1-max-150x150.png"],[[69,69],"assets/images/resized/0015/2787/152787v1-max-250x250.png"],[[69,69],"assets/images/resized/0015/2787/152787v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder","firm":{"name":"Squid Labs","permalink":"squidlabs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0003/7854/37854v1-max-150x150.png"],[[185,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/7854/37854v1-max-250x250.png"],[[185,31],"assets/images/resized/0003/7854/37854v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","firm":{"name":"Instructables","permalink":"instructables","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0001/1058/11058v1-max-150x150.png"],[[234,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/1058/11058v1-max-250x250.png"],[[234,59],"assets/images/resized/0001/1058/11058v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
