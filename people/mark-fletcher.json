As CEO, Mark raised money from CMGI and Bertelsmann Ventures in 1998. The service was the category leader from the beginning and in November 1999, ONElist acquired eGroups, its main competition. Yahoo acquired the resulting company, renamed eGroups, in June 2000 and the service is now called Yahoo Groups. At acquisition, eGroups served twenty million active users, one million email lists, and sent out over two billion email messages a month, making it one of the largest services on the Internet.

He has two cats, but he only blogs about them when he&#8217;s about to make a big announcement.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0001/9110/19110v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/9110/19110v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,180],"assets/images/resized/0001/9110/19110v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.wingedpig.com/bio.html\" title=\"Mark Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Fletcher</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Pitchero","permalink":"pitchero","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0013/5688/135688v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0013/5688/135688v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,128],"assets/images/resized/0013/5688/135688v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","firm":{"name":"Generex Biotechnology","permalink":"generex-biotechnology","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0017/1695/171695v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0017/1695/171695v1-max-250x250.png"],[[439,101],"assets/images/resized/0017/1695/171695v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Bloglines","permalink":"bloglines","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0000/2734/2734v8-max-150x150.png"],[[206,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/2734/2734v8-max-250x250.png"],[[206,60],"assets/images/resized/0000/2734/2734v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President","firm":{"name":"Ask.com","permalink":"ask-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/0842/10842v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0001/0842/10842v6-max-250x250.png"],[[365,241],"assets/images/resized/0001/0842/10842v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
