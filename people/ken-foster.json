It would be great if you could mention us in a blog before our launch on May 11th.</p>\n\n<p>So what? I hear you ask, well our site is a little bit different from all the &#8216;vanity&#8217; sites out there because we want to give both artists and fans the best deal with a pretty cool interface to boot.</p>\n\n<p>As you know the music industry has totally transformed from a few years ago and we&#8217;ve been developing a system that we think will revolutionize the way bands and fans interact (and more importantly maximize their income). Gone are the days when labels and promotion agencies could take a big percentage of the fruits of your graft.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, bands and artists want to see the maximum return on their music. They want promotion and they don&#8217;t mind giving the odd track away as a sampler. Fans want to buy the music but they want to pay what they want, get stuff free and more importantly have meaningful interaction with the bands.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll be giving a whopping 86% royalty to our artists.\nWe&#8217;ll be none exclusive (Artists are free to sell elsewhere)\nWe&#8217;ll be transparent (Artists have direct control of pricing and sales figures).\nWe&#8217;ll be label friendly - so no problem for bands already signed.\nWe&#8217;ll be devoting a considerable amount of time to promoting our artists (through our genre charts and specialist recommendations)\nWe&#8217;ll have an uber cool interface. Fans will love interacting with the site.\nWe are UK based and aim to be the premier site for labels, media and sync licensing companies to find the best new music.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a recent article at Louder Than War http://louderthanwar.com/aurovine-new-online-music-outlet/</p>\n\n<p>We are launching on May 11th.
