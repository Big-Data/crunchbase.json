In this key leadership role, Elliott oversaw Microsoft&#8217;s work in providing innovative technology solutions and forward-thinking programs to help public sector organizations provide efficient and effective public services to their citizens and build the capacity of their populations. Under her leadership, Elliott improved customer satisfaction and Microsoftâ€™s image among government elites, grew share across all product lines, and increased revenues from $4.7B in 2004 to $8B in 2008. Elliott was a member of the board for Microsoft Unlimited Potential, which develops new business models and technologies to help close the digital divide and bring social and economic opportunity to the estimated five billion people not yet realizing the benefits of technology. Building on a long-standing commitment to provide genuine business value to customers, Elliott also led the World Class Selling initiative across the entire company. Prior to October 2004, Elliott was co-head of Microsoft&#8217;s North American subsidiary and led the U.S. Enterprise Sales segment, which includes some of Microsoft&#8217;s largest and most strategic customers.

In that capacity, she led the team responsible for IBM&#8217;s largest customers in the retail, wholesale and consumer goods, travel, and transportation industries across North and South America. During her tenure at IBM, Elliott had executive and management positions in strategy development, services and consulting, product management and sales field and headquarter leadership. \nAs a Microsoft executive, Elliott was a member of the Western Region Advisory Board of Catalyst, a global organization promoting opportunities for women in business, and the National Board of Operation Hope Inc., a nonprofit organization promoting economic empowerment in underserved communities. She also serves on the Steering Board of the World Economic Forum&#8217;s Global Education Initiative and recently served on the U.S. Commission on Higher Education appointed by the Secretary of Education.
