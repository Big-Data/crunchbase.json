Shortly after being born in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, MA, he began a journey that would take him coast to coast before finally settling in suburban North Texas. He began his adult life as a student at Texas Tech University, where he was a member of the Dean&#8217;s list, Tenor Soloist in the University Jazz Ensemble, and an active member of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation and Mobile Development club. He also traveled across the Atlantic Ocean to participate in a study abroad program in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. Faced with financial burdens, an obsolete curriculum, low internet bandwidth, and an educational climate that stifled creativity rather than evoking it, he escaped the high plains of West Texas to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/4570/194570v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/4570/194570v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/4570/194570v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Nolan Clemmons</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
