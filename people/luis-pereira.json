He is currently responsible for Ask Poodle&#8217;s day-to-day operations.</p>\n\n<p>Luis was born to the proverbial hard working (Portuguese) immigrant parents in Newark, NJ. His experience with technology started at the age of 10. His first computer, like so many of his generation, was the beloved and irrepressible Commodore 64. But he wasnâ€™t just tinkering on his C-64 in his free time. Luis is no stranger to Edisonâ€™s theory of 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.</p>\n\n<p>After graduating high school, Luis&#8217; interest in computers and technology lead him to enroll at DeVry Technical Institute where, in 1995, he graduated with a degree in Computer Information Systems. Luis has worked as an IT Consultant for the past 10 years. His entrepreneurial streak has spawned a successful troubleshooting consulting firm where he worked as Regional Director of Computer Troubleshooters New Jersey, and most recently as an owner/operator of a Dunkin Donuts franchise.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998 Luis became very interested and intrigued by online search and began working on a local business web portal. It was to be called the Global Business Network Directory (GBND) or the Global Business Web Directory (GBWD). Due to lack of funding and uncertainty about the direction in which ecommerce and the internet was heading, he was forced to put this project on hold. An incubation period followed as Luis watched the internet business model unfold.</p>\n\n<p>Today he has resumed his work on the concept for a local business web directory with a renewed fervor.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/2998/12998v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/2998/12998v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[338,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/2998/12998v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"AdShouts","permalink":"adshouts","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0008/7980/87980v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0008/7980/87980v2-max-250x250.png"],[[256,91],"assets/images/resized/0008/7980/87980v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"AskPoodle","permalink":"askpoodle","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0001/2668/12668v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,111],"assets/images/resized/0001/2668/12668v1-max-250x250.png"],[[290,129],"assets/images/resized/0001/2668/12668v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":null,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Stumpedia","permalink":"stumpedia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/8015/18015v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0001/8015/18015v1-max-250x250.png"],[[263,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8015/18015v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Stumpedia","permalink":"stumpedia","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/8015/18015v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,71],"assets/images/resized/0001/8015/18015v1-max-250x250.png"],[[263,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/8015/18015v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
