Dub Poetry is his favoured medium of expression although his earlier works were more MC/world fusion with a hybrid form of dancehall music from Cyprus via London. And he has collaborated with a wide range of artists including:</p>\n\n<p>Producer Simon Emmerson, the acid-jazz funk band Izit, Greek Rappers Imiskoubria and more recently the Cyprus songstress Lia Vissy.\nOver the last 10 years Haji Mike has been working more through collaborations on the net with Standout Selector (USA), Bandulu Dub (Portugal), Jah Billah (Croatia), Spill The Milk (UK) and Sonic Crime (Greece &amp; Cyprus). </p>\n\n<p>In 2009 he connected in a virtual sense with producer Dub Caravan. Their collaborative work, the CD â€˜Virtual Oasisâ€™ was recorded and produced entirely online.  This along with many other online collaborations have influenced current research interest by the dub poet, with a forthcoming paper at The Art of Recording  Production Conference at Leeds University in December 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Haji Mike also produces a weekly radio show, OuterNational and teaches Communications at The University of Nicosia, Cyprus. He has published articles on poetry and multiculturalism, early colonial photography in Cyprus and equal opportunities/diversity.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0010/0160/100160v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0160/100160v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/0160/100160v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"Cultural Studies","institution":"University of Birmingham","graduated_year":1997,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MA","subject":"Literature","institution":"University of Essex","graduated_year":1984,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Government & Sociology","institution":"University of Essex","graduated_year":1982,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"director founder","firm":{"name":"Olive Tree Music","permalink":"olive-tree-music","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/JLx40dLbdKU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/JLx40dLbdKU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>All I Want To Be</p>"},{"embed_code":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/JLx40dLbdKU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/JLx40dLbdKU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>","description":"<p>Video clip &#8220;All I Want To Be&#8221; Haji MIke &amp; Dub Caravan</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.ukreggaeguide.co.uk/index.php?id=136","title":"Review of The StoryMan CD in UK ReggaeGuide"},{"external_url":"http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/album-created-online-results-series-concerts/20100721","title":"Album created online results in series of concerts"},{"external_url":"http://www.rutzen-verlag.de/publikationen/peleus19.html","title":"link to book with a Chapter by Dr Mike Hajimichael"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.hajimike.com","title":"main artist web page"},{"external_url":"http://www.myspace.com/hajimike1","title":"haji mike @ myspace "},{"external_url":"http://sublimeridiculous.wordpress.com/","title":"haji mike wordpress blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/HAJIMIKEY","title":"haji mike on facebook"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/hajimike","title":"haji mike on twitter"},{"external_url":"http://hajimike.podomatic.com/","title":"haji mike outernational podcast site"},{"external_url":"http://bigupradio.com/radio/radio-shows/outernational","title":"haji mike radio show on bigupradio"},{"external_url":"http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=467235","title":"haji mike on soundclick"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/hajimike?feature=mhum","title":"haji mike's youtube channel"},{"external_url":"http://unic.academia.edu/MikeHajimichael","title":"mike hajimichael web page on academia.edu"}]}
