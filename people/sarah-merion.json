She has her own website, SarahMerion.com, where she educates on Social Media and challenges people to think about using social media to benefit their business. She has a cult following on Twitter (check her out @SarahMerion) and has even hosted multiple workshops on using Twitter and LinkedIn at her campus at Northeastern and at MIT. Her RoofUp Tweetup was the biggest in Boston and Northeastern approved a grant she wrote to finance her trip to a Social Media conference in Chicago called SOBCon.\nOn top of all of that, sheâ€™s only 21 and still a student at Northeastern, studying Spanish, Management Information Systems and Finance, currently on internship in NYC doing data analysis for a mega media company. Not to mention, sheâ€™s sassy, hilarious and can we say: Coolest. Hair. Ever. When I discovered this girl, I knew I had to bag an interview, so I contacted her via YouTube to grab her attention (donâ€™t laugh). It worked and we quickly began collaborating on this interview, on top of a few other projects in the works. Sarah Merion is an inspiration for college girls who want to be entrepreneurs while still in school and proof that maybe, just maybe, the finance world isnâ€™t as screwed as we thought.</p>\n\n<p>From Melanie Danko&#8217;s Interview with Sarah Merion at http://is.gd/6xwYu</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"Finance","institution":"Northeastern University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://collegecandy.com/2009/07/22/the-five-questions-we-ask-everyone-sarahmerion/","title":"Interview with Sarah Merion"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/sarahmerion","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmerion","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/sarahmerion","title":"Facebook"}]}
