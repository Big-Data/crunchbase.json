Needless to say, I made a couple of questionable decisions and was â€œencouragedâ€ to leave school just five days after arriving on campus.</p>\n\n<p>I returned home with my tail between my legs and was expecting the riot act from my parents. Sure, they were disappointed and so was I. But my father said something to me then that I will never forget. He said, â€œSon, someday you are going to be very successful in business because you are not afraid to take risks. You just need the right direction to channel your energy.â€</p>\n\n<p>What my father said to me that night was very encouraging and that set me out on a path to find a place to channel my entrepreneurial energy. This was right smack dab in the middle of the dot com boom. I didn&#8217;t have any money so I thought I had to find a job.</p>\n\n<p>I went to work for this dot com company selling websites door to door to local businesses. That lasted for a few months until they told me that they could no longer pay me my salary. It did give me some good experience in direct sales which I am grateful for. After that I went to work at a drycleaners. I was there for about a year and wasn&#8217;t happy. I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere and I knew that if I was gonna get wealthy I needed to get out of the employee role and needed to start my own business. I Realized</p>\n\n<p>â€œI wasnâ€™t going to become wealthy working for someone else!â€</p>\n\n<p>I knew that most of the wealth in this country is controlled by business owners and most of that wealth was created through real estate. I didn&#8217;t have any experience in real estate, I didn&#8217;t have any money and I didn&#8217;t have any credit so I wasn&#8217;t sure how I was gonna get started as a real estate investor.</p>\n\n<p>Then one night while I was watching TV, I saw a commercial for a free workshop on how to do real estate without money, credit or experience. That was attractive to me because I didnâ€™t have any of those. So I went to the workshop and they explained what it was all about and they were also offering a seminar for $5000 to teach the whole process of how to do the business.</p>\n\n<p>This was a defining moment in my life. I had to make the decision of whether to walk out of that room and go look for another job or to invest money that I didn&#8217;t have to go to the seminar. I ended up putting the seminar on a credit card and I haven&#8217;t looked back since. I will never be employed by anyone except for myself for the rest of my life.</p>\n\n<p>I learned a lot at that seminar and I am the type of person that takes massive action. The Secret and the Law of Attraction are all well and good but the truth of the matter is; you are not going to change your life unless you take massive action. When I know what I want, I go after it. I went home and started implementing all of the strategies that I learned. I started buying a lot of houses and was very scattered. I was using all types of strategies and was all over the place.</p>\n\n<p>I was doing rehabbing, subject-to&#8217;s, wholesales, vacant houses, REO&#8217;s. My cash flow was terrible and because I owned all these houses, I had either taken over the payments or I went out and got hard money loans to buy the properties. So I had to make payments on all of them.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up maxing out my credit cards, my credit score took a huge dive and I was almost out of business before I started. It wasn&#8217;t until I figured out that by working the foreclosure market, you don&#8217;t have to make payments on houses and you don&#8217;t have to fix them up.</p>\n\n<p>I stuck it out. I ended up selling the houses I had loans on and I paid off my credit cards and from that point on, I only do short sale deals Now. It took me 2 years to get to a point where I was financially free. If I could do it all over again, I would start right with foreclosures and skip all of the other stuff.</p>\n\n<p>I created all of the automation systems in my business and now the business runs without me. I spend about an hour a week meeting with my team and we close an average of 3 -4 short sales a month at an average profit of $38,000. Its an average of $38,000 because we do some wholesale deals that range from the $10,000-$20,000 range and we do some luxury homes that are in the $80,000 to $170,000 range.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after years of investing in real estate, Iâ€™ve confirmed that thereâ€™s no better way to take control of your money (especially controlling it to make BIG profits and returns than by including preforeclosure investing in your real estate investment arsenal.</p>\n\n<p>I live life on my terms now. I work when I want. I play when I want. I live in Florida on the gulf and every night I sit and watch the fish jump behind my house. Iâ€™m not saying this to brag. I am saying this because I pictured myself living in this house 5 years ago. I had never seen the house except for in my mind.</p>\n\n<p>I am no different than you. I just figured it out the system. I kept the picture of my future in my head every day until I reached my goal and didnâ€™t give up. Now I have new goals that Iâ€™m reaching for and one of them is giving back.</p>\n\n<p>The way that Iâ€™m giving back is teaching as many people as I can how to take advantage of the current opportunity in the real estate market and make an absolute fortune with foreclosures while helping out a ton of homeowners at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m only 32 years old and there are so many great things happening in my life right now, I couldnâ€™t be happier. My students are cashing huge checks in their foreclosure businesses, I Finally found the love of my life and I got engaged last month, and I am living the life I designed for myself. I believe we can create our own destiny and I believe anyone can create their own destiny.</p>\n\n<p>Its all about living the lifestyle you want. To have the freedom to do what you want, when you want, and not have to answer to anyone like your boss. Of course its a lot easier to do when you have the money to do it. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m on a mission to do.</p>\n\n<p>I want you to never have to worry about paying bills ever again. I want you to have as much money as you could ever need so you never have to say you canâ€™t do something ever again because you canâ€™t afford it. And To be able to provide an exceptional life for their families</p>\n\n<p>Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m all about. I know my family appreciates the exceptional life I provide for them.</p>\n\n<p>Dedicated to Multiplying Your Income,</p>\n\n<p>D.C.
