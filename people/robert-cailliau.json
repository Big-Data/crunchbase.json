In April 1987 he left the PS division to become group leader of Office Computing Systems in the Data Handling division. </p>\n\n<p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a hypertext system for access to the many forms of documentation at and related to CERN. Berners-Lee created the system, calling it World Wide Web, between September to December 1990. During this time, Cailliau and he co-authored a proposal for funding for the project. Cailliau later became a key proponent of the project.</p>\n\n<p>In 1993, in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Cailliau started the European Commission&#8217;s first web-based project for information dissemination in Europe (WISE). As a result of his work with CERN&#8217;s Legal Service, CERN released the web technology into the public domain on 30 April 1993.</p>\n\n<p>In December 1993 Cailliau called for the first International WWW Conference which was held at CERN in May 1994. The oversubscribed conference brought together 380 web pioneers and was a milestone in the development of the web. </p>\n\n<p>The conference led to the forming of the International World Wide Web Conference Committee which has organized an annual conference since then. Cailliau was a member of the Committee from 1994 until 2002.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/5456/85456v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[176,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/5456/85456v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[225,318],"assets/images/resized/0008/5456/85456v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"he died\r\n","stoned_year":2005,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":17,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"google","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Cailliau","permalink":"robert-cailliau"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
