MeetCute Inc. has recently received funding from the Emmy &amp; Oscar award winning angel investor, Bill Warner.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Danil was a CEO and Founder at Questli AG. He traved between Switzerland, Russia, and the United States to manage his company. After generating excitement and funding for his idea at LeWeb’10, and continuing to attract investors and develop his platform, Danil won the “Audience Choice Award” at TechCrunch Disrupt 2011. He also manages a very promising project PassMyWill.com, created during the Disrupt Hackathon.</p>\n\n<p>Danil was born and raised in the middle of nowhere – a small town at the edge of Siberia where no English is spoken. He faced many obstacles on his journey from Angarsk to Silicon Valley, including knowing absolutely no one in the industry, but by the time Danil received his Engineering degree in Computer Science and Applied Math from Novosibirsk State Technical University, he already ran a social gaming company with four employees. His English is the product of sheer focus and concentration over nine months at the University of San Diego.</p>\n\n<p>Danil has “never thought about getting a job” because he looks forward to running his own companies and generating new ideas. Though his achievements can be attributed to hard work, positive thinking, and perseverance, he cannot ignore the importance of his father, Alexey’s, belief in him.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/0010/110010v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[168,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/0010/110010v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[302,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/0010/110010v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Danil Kozyatnikov at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2011 as an Audience Choice</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","institution":"Novosibirsk State Technical University","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Engineer","subject":"Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","institution":"Novosibirsk State Technical University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"ESL course","subject":"English Language","institution":"University of San Diego","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","firm":{"name":"Aksilon","permalink":"aksilon","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0010/6159/106159v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0010/6159/106159v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,119],"assets/images/resized/0010/6159/106159v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO and Founder","firm":{"name":"Questli","permalink":"questli","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0012/9010/129010v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,119],"assets/images/resized/0012/9010/129010v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,214],"assets/images/resized/0012/9010/129010v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"MeetCute","permalink":"meetcute","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6420/216420v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/6420/216420v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/6420/216420v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/z9qt67m1O6w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kpO_cGclAok\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QrDbYeAn0UE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?deepLinkEmbedCode=1zc21zMjo03MlK-rNfj82dLr06mHmu0Q&height=242&video_pcode=11amo6qGw2oucN78pR-BYbDpCESk&embedCode=1zc21zMjo03MlK-rNfj82dLr06mHmu0Q&width=430\"></script>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?deepLinkEmbedCode=pnNm5zMjrgcNRZ7kR7UJdwnAD4e7yCIh&height=242&video_pcode=11amo6qGw2oucN78pR-BYbDpCESk&embedCode=pnNm5zMjrgcNRZ7kR7UJdwnAD4e7yCIh&width=430\"></script>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?height=242&deepLinkEmbedCode=gzbWpzMjpYx56UHwOg05iKVA-ShN-vk4&video_pcode=11amo6qGw2oucN78pR-BYbDpCESk&embedCode=gzbWpzMjpYx56UHwOg05iKVA-ShN-vk4&width=430\"></script>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eVbM9yQ-I0E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dftsHiXQXPQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> ","description":""}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://blog.questli.com/200k-from-siberia/","title":"200,000 CHF in VC from Siberia"},{"external_url":"http://www.leweb.net/2011/blog/how-be-rock-star-evening-leweb","title":"How to be \"the rock star of the evening\" at LeWeb"},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/02/passmywill-is-a-will-for-your-online-assets-and-passwords/","title":"PassMyWill Is A Will For Your Online Assets And Passwords"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/danilka","title":"@Danilka"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/danilka","title":"LinkedIn Profile"},{"external_url":"http://about.me/Danilka","title":"about.me/Danilka"}]}
