Nuria graduated from Stanford University where she studied Economics and Spanish. She began her career in technology and management consulting at Accenture, focusing on customer relationship management. Leaving to pursue her interests in start-ups and marketing, and her passion for the Latino market, she joined a Hispanic digital marketing start-up, helping brands connect with this market through online advertising and branded content. The start-up was later acquired by AudienceScience. Nuria then moved to Los Angeles in search of more sunshine-filled days, and to lead all digital marketing efforts for a five-time Grammy winning and Spanish-speaking celebrity before joining EQAL. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Business Development and Partner Strategy","firm":{"name":"EQAL","permalink":"eqal","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[64,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/7414/17414v8-max-150x150.png"],[[64,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/7414/17414v8-max-250x250.png"],[[64,90],"assets/images/resized/0001/7414/17414v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
