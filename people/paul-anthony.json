Paul also recognized that this is possible only when businesses have easy access to high-quality music. So he and his team began reinventing music licensing. A musician in his own right, Paul produced recordings with Grammy award-winning artist Sarah McLachlan, composed full orchestral scores for feature films, and frequently co-produces with established artists such as the King of Funk, George Clinton. \nPaul frequently shares his expertise with regard to music-related copyright issues, speaking at industry events and giving interviews to a range of media outlets, including CNBC, CNN, Inc. Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, and Billboard.\nToday, Paul&#8217;s brainchild is thriving: the Rumblefish Music Licensing Store is widely recognized as the leading online source of music for businesses; and Rumblefish&#8217;s sonic branding practice is setting the standard for the strategic use of music in building brands and delivering transformative customer experiences.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Spaceman","permalink":"spaceman","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Rumblefish","permalink":"rumblefish","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0010/3480/103480v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[201,66],"assets/images/resized/0010/3480/103480v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[201,66],"assets/images/resized/0010/3480/103480v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Webdistortion","permalink":"webdistortion","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0002/7023/27023v2-max-150x150.png"],[[244,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/7023/27023v2-max-250x250.png"],[[244,33],"assets/images/resized/0002/7023/27023v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Shablamo","permalink":"shablamo","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"SongFlame","permalink":"songflame","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0011/4875/114875v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,89],"assets/images/resized/0011/4875/114875v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,161],"assets/images/resized/0011/4875/114875v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.FriendlyMusic.com","title":"Friendly Music - Soundtracks for social video"},{"external_url":"http://www.Rumblefish.com","title":"Rumblefish - Music Licensing"}]}
