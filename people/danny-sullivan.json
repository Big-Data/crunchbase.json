The results were published online as &#8220;A Webmaster&#8217;s Guide To Search Engines,&#8221; a pioneering effort to answer the many questions site designers and Internet publicists had about search engines.</p>\n\n<p>The positive reaction from both marketers and general search engine users caused Danny to expand the guide into Search Engine Watch, where he served as editor-in-chief through November 2006. Now he heads up Search Engine Land as editor-in-chief, taking it into the next generation of search coverage. Danny also serves as Third Door Media&#8217;s chief content officer.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/0644/40644v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/0644/40644v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0004/0644/40644v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dannysullivan/\" title=\"Danny Sullivan on Flickr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danny Sullivan on Flickr</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Editor in Chief","firm":{"name":"Search Engine Land","permalink":"search-engine-land","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0004/0643/40643v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0004/0643/40643v1-max-250x250.png"],[[314,74],"assets/images/resized/0004/0643/40643v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/people/Danny_Sullivan/684476602","title":"Danny Sullivan on Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/dannysullivan","title":"Sullivan on Twitter"}]}
