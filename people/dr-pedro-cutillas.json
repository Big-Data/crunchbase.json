His focus of research involves the use of MS and related analytical techniques to quantify the activity of cell signalling pathways. He holds a PhD in biological mass spectrometry from the laboratory of Mike Waterfield, UCL, and was co-supervised by\nAl Burlingame and Robert Unwin. Pedro conceived the core technologies of Activiomics and has developed unique knowledge and expertise in the use of these MS-based analytical techniques. This makes him uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between modern analytical technologies and their biological application.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[106,106],"assets/images/resized/0012/6476/126476v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[106,106],"assets/images/resized/0012/6476/126476v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[106,106],"assets/images/resized/0012/6476/126476v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founding Director","firm":{"name":"Activiomics","permalink":"activiomics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0012/6473/126473v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,59],"assets/images/resized/0012/6473/126473v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[310,74],"assets/images/resized/0012/6473/126473v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
