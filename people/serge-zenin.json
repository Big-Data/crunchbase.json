As he assimilated to his new environment, Serge expressed a fascination with the English language, and by the age of thirteen, enjoyed writing poetry and short stories. At Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn,</p>\n\n<p>Serge cultivated his creative writing abilities and excelled in specialized classes with exceptional teachers. In 2008, Serge graduated from Macaulay Honors College at Baruch with a B.B.A. in Operations Management, which honed his understanding. In 2011, Serge received his J.D. from the Fordham University School of Law, graduating with honors.</p>\n\n<p>His internship at Samsung Construction in Seoul, South Korea, and his legal work at NYC’s Department of Consumer Affairs have provided him with valuable insight related to commercial contracts, loan agreements, and false advertising issues. During his clinic experience with Fordham’s Lincoln Square Legal Services, Serge vigorously advocated on behalf of clients, helping them overcome financial difficulties resulting from elusive automobile financing contracts and personal debts.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, while in law school, Serge decided to apply his expertise in advertising law and founded Media Contours, Inc., a Manhattan based public relations and marketing firm specializing in web-based, virtual campaigns. Media Contours has consulted numerous small businesses and entrepreneurs on properly developing and maintaining compelling marketing strategies, managing events, and staying relevant in the crowded New York City marketplace. Using highly innovative virtual approaches combined with more traditional brick-and-mortar methods, Media Contours successfully steered new business to restaurants and other businesses primarily located in Manhattan area.</p>\n\n<p>In collaboration with partnering agencies, Media Contours has designed numerous websites, managed social media platforms on behalf of clients, ghost written content with highly optimized keywords, and developed promotional events that publicized numerous restaurants and other organizations.</p>\n\n<p>In his capacity as the Director of BD at Media Contours, Serge has worked passionately to solve the marketing problems of his clients, with a specialty in writing content for specific target audiences and diligently capturing the essence of his client’s message. </p>\n\n<p>His dedication to meeting client needs often goes over and above what is required of him, since there is no one-size-fits-all solution to a client’s personal marketing conundrums. Serge has worked arduously to find highly customized solutions with the assistance of expertly trained programmers, designers, and brand managers.</p>\n\n<p>In his free time, Serge enjoys traveling, skiing, writing poetry, and learning languages. Serge also works with musicians to organize monthly musical events designed to provide aspiring music artists and DJ’s with a platform to express themselves through their music in front of live audiences.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0019/0925/190925v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0019/0925/190925v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0019/0925/190925v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Media Contours","permalink":"media-contours","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/DXfJQLVPsXA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Serge Zenin - Social Media Week Made Manhattan Move</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aRVTAJxYRc8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Serge Zenin - How Company X was Guided to Success</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-OXmESDHLRQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Serge Zenin - Jack Found it at Exit Nine</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zAuz4Q69oFE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Serge Zenin - Destiny</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/sergezenin","title":"Serge Zenin Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/sergezenin","title":"Serge Zenin Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://sergezenin.tumblr.com/","title":"Tumblr"},{"external_url":"http://sergezenin.com","title":"Serge Zenin Home"},{"external_url":"http://sergezenin.wordpress.com/","title":"Serge Zenin Wordpress"},{"external_url":"http://www.meetup.com/members/48682362/","title":"Meetup"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/serge-zenin/13/34/95","title":"Serge Zenin Linkedin"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/114284881332325279211","title":"Google+"},{"external_url":"http://www.myspace.com/serge_zenin","title":"Serge Zenin Myspace"},{"external_url":"http://digg.com/sergezenin","title":"Serge Zenin's Digg"},{"external_url":"http://pinterest.com/sergezenin","title":"Serge Zenin Pinterest"},{"external_url":"http://sergezenin.tumblr.com","title":"Tumblr Serge Zenin"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXfJQLVPsXA","title":"Serge Zenin Poetry"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/people/sergezenin/","title":"Serge Zenin Flickr"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAuz4Q69oFE","title":"Serge Zenin \"Destiny\" Poem"},{"external_url":"http://vimeo.com/sergezenin","title":"Vimeo Profile"},{"external_url":"http://sergezenin.blogspot.com/","title":"Serge Zenin Blogspot"},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Serge_Zenin","title":"Serge Zenin Wiki"}]}
