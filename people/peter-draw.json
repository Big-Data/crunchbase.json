All he ever wanted to do when he grows up is to draw and make others happy.</p>\n\n<p>At 6 years old, he was kicked out of an drawing workshop and was told to forget about drawing because he couldn&#8217;t afford the fee. He ran home believing that dreams do not come true for poor people like him. But everything became alright when his grandfather told him that dreams do come true if you believe in yourself.</p>\n\n<p>At 16 years old, his grandfather passed away. In tears, he learnt that our loved ones do not wait forever for us to grow up. At this stage, Peter decided to draw to protect other children&#8217;s dreams. He wanted his life to mean something.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Peter travels around the world drawing to protect children&#8217;s childhood dreams &#8211; because children deserve the best. His record-breaking drawings have warmed the hearts of over 100,000 lives in 30 cities in 20 countries, including Jackie Chan and Nobel Peace Laureate Dr Oscar Arias.</p>\n\n<p>Peter dreams about the day he sits his grandchildren on a swing and tell them how a young artist went for his dreams and changed the world. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"DRAW","permalink":"draw","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNgdc-ozCwU","title":"Testimonial from Jackie Chan"},{"external_url":"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/303301/1/.html","title":"Peter's 1st Guinness World Record - World's Largest Caricature"},{"external_url":"http://www.csrdigest.com/2010/10/cisco-celebrates-25-years-of-giving-back/","title":"Peter's 2nd Guinness World Record - World's Largest Art Lesson"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/peterdraw","title":"Official Facebook "},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/whyidraw","title":"Official Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/peterdraw","title":"Official YouTube"}]}
