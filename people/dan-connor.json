I can work with a wide variety of media types such as: audio, video, print, and the web. </p>\n\n<p>Web: In new-media &amp; web development I work with businesses, artists, and corporations to create web presence, front-end, and e-commerce solutions. I&#8217;ve got a robust background in jQuery, CSS, HTML, and vector/raster graphics apps. On the backend I can work in PHP and Ruby. I set up and administer Linux and BSD web/email servers, deploying LAMP, LAPP, BNMP (BSD, nginx, mysql, PHP), and various Ruby stacks for clients and for miscellaneous personal projects.</p>\n\n<p>Audio &amp; Music: Engineered on Grammy nominated album, produced/engineered indie artists, prolific studio musicians, and Top 40 artists. I&#8217;ve been Pro Tools certified, but am fond of the leaner, meaner Reaper DAW environment. Mixing is my specialty. I can polish tracks to commercial or better-than-commercial standards on SSL consoles in huge control rooms or on DAWs with arrays of plugins.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/9195/169195v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/9195/169195v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0016/9195/169195v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Web Developer","firm":{"name":"Servio","permalink":"servio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0012/7345/127345v11-max-150x150.png"],[[250,58],"assets/images/resized/0012/7345/127345v11-max-250x250.png"],[[450,105],"assets/images/resized/0012/7345/127345v11-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.danconnor.com","title":"Dan Connor.com"},{"external_url":"http://thestereobus.com","title":"The Stereo Bus Blog"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/thestereobus","title":"Twitter"}]}
