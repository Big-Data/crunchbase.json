Jacques began his career in 1995 with the launch of the award-winning Web development agency, Web Elite. Jacques built the company into a 35 person perennial leader in the span of five years. As the company’s headquarters in Ann Arbor, MI spread to regional offices in New York City and San Francisco, companies like Sun Microsystems, General Motors, and Wells Fargo turned to Jacques to develop their on-line strategies. Jacques sold Web Elite in 2002 and focused on his already established private equity and consulting firm, Noospheric, LLC. Jacques launched FirstClickSEO in early 2007, helped launched Brush Buddy in 2008, and partnered with three engineering graduates in 2009 to launch the award-winning Phone Halo. Most recently, Jacques Habra launched SBClick to bring Santa Barbara in the Palm of the Hand.</p>\n\n<p>Jacques explains, “Successful startups are a function of focus, strategy, and most importantly - great management.”</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The opportunity to share insights of business and technology with a philosophical spin with colleagues, students, and fellow entrepreneurs has been a life dream that I will always pursue,&#8221; explains Jacques.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/7145/167145v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/7145/167145v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,267],"assets/images/resized/0016/7145/167145v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Dual BA with Honors","subject":"English and Philosophy","institution":"University of Michigan","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"FirstClickInc","permalink":"firstclickinc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"General Manager","firm":{"name":"Noospheric","permalink":"noospheric","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Partnered with Chris Herbert, Christian Smith, and Tyler Crain to launch Phone Halo","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":10,"source_url":"http://www.noozhawk.com/local_news/article/072510_phone_halo/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Phone Halo Rings In New Aura of Keeping In Touch","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jacques","last_name":"Habra","permalink":"jacques-habra-2"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.noospheric.com","title":"Noospheric"},{"external_url":"http://www.firstclickinc.com","title":"FirstClickInc"},{"external_url":"http://www.jacqueshabra.com","title":"Jacques Habra - Speaker and Philosopher"},{"external_url":"http://www.santabarbaraentrepreneur.com/","title":"Santa Barbara Magazine features Jacques Habra"},{"external_url":"http://www.noozhawk.com/article/091011_sb_mobile_meetup/","title":"Santa Barbara Mobile Meetup Features Jacques Habra as Keynote Speaker"},{"external_url":"http://www.jacqueshabra.com/awards-accolades/","title":"Jacques Habra Awards & Accolades"},{"external_url":"http://www.jacqueshabra.com/speaking-engagements/","title":"Jacques recent Speaking Engagements"},{"external_url":"http://www.vimeo.com/jacqueshabra","title":"Jacques Habra Video Clips"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/jhabra","title":"Follow Jacques on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueshabra","title":"Jacques Habra on LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/people/jacqueshabra/","title":"Jacques Habra on Flickr"}]}
