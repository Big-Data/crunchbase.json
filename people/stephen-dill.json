Scoring high in spatial reasoning and trained as an architect, I use the creative problem solving techniques I learned in nearly every application, to include manipulating 3D space. Having a natural affinity for technology and for empathizing with others, I have often utilized my communications skills to liaison between programmers and their clients or to distill business needs into application specifications. Since my second year out of college I have spoken to C-suite executives (3-star Generals to CEOs) and have spoken before audiences in the thousands in seminars and conferences. In addition to strengths in conceptualizing, communicating and collaborating, I am a trained and practiced leader. However, I am very comfortable in the role of follower in order to support the team. Attitude is everything.</p>\n\n<p>Face-to-face interaction with internal and external clients for over 20 years has resulted in extensive experience in determining needs, conceptualizing new approaches, developing and articulating new solutions, organizing teams, and taking products and services to market. I am a seasoned international marketer and manager with expertise in the development and use of social media and all other interactive channels, as well as their integration with traditional marketing and sales channels. I am excited by the evolution of the online channel to a point where customer interaction can be trusted, detailed, and highly rewarding for all concerned. The tools are available, interface knowledge is high, and the return on investment has never been more apparent.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Architecture","institution":"Lehigh University","graduated_year":1978,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Interactive Marketing","firm":{"name":"State Street Corporation","permalink":"state-street-corporation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0015/6881/156881v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,51],"assets/images/resized/0015/6881/156881v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[206,51],"assets/images/resized/0015/6881/156881v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Dir.
