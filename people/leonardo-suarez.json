While his career began with positions in the plastics and legal publishing industries, his entrepreneurial streak soon kicked in, as he provided technical assistance and consulting services to a number of other firms. Eventually, this experience led him to co-found Element Group Ltd., a consulting company for new media. Later, he sold his stake in the company in order to broaden his experience and horizons.</p>\n\n<p>At Torrenegra Labs, Leonardo applies his knowledge and experience to develop new business opportunities, as well conducting market research and strategic analysis for new projects and investments. Most of his current activities are focused on supporting the companyâ€™s start-ups, which include Voice123, Language123 and LetMeGo.com, Torrenegra Labsâ€™ most ambitious venture yet.</p>\n\n<p>He is an active supporter of social networking among the technology innovators in his native country. To this end, he has co-founded Bogotech, an â€œunconferenceâ€  and networking event inspired by the New York Tech Meetup. At Bogotech, people can pitch their projects or companies to other industry professionals; he is  currently developing hubBOG, a space in which tech companies can share workspace, exchange experiences, and network in BogotÃ¡, Colombia.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/4935/64935v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/4935/64935v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0006/4935/64935v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Industrial design","institution":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana","graduated_year":1999,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Localo","permalink":"localo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,74],"assets/images/resized/0013/2034/132034v2-max-150x150.png"],[[179,89],"assets/images/resized/0013/2034/132034v2-max-250x250.png"],[[179,89],"assets/images/resized/0013/2034/132034v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","firm":{"name":"Voice123","permalink":"voice123","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/5467/25467v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0002/5467/25467v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,139],"assets/images/resized/0002/5467/25467v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner and Operations Chief","firm":{"name":"Torrenegra Labs","permalink":"torrenegra-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/6163/26163v12-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/6163/26163v12-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/6163/26163v12-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","firm":{"name":"LetMeGo","permalink":"letmego","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0003/3706/33706v9-max-150x150.png"],[[200,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/3706/33706v9-max-250x250.png"],[[200,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/3706/33706v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"SnappyGo","permalink":"snappygo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0016/3913/163913v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,116],"assets/images/resized/0016/3913/163913v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,209],"assets/images/resized/0016/3913/163913v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder & COO","firm":{"name":"BookingMarkets (Dashbell)","permalink":"bookingmarkets-dashbell","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0014/5351/145351v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0014/5351/145351v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,84],"assets/images/resized/0014/5351/145351v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
