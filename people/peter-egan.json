Once Egan Medical&#8217;s move across state lines is complete, it will mark the first Egan company to conduct business from a state other than Louisiana.</p>\n\n<p>Egan Medical was the product of nearly a decade&#8217;s worth of experience in the e-commerce field, during which time Peter also founded such companies as GoDOTyourself.com and Premium Domains by Fat Lester.</p>\n\n<p>Peter attended St. Paul School in Covington, LA, where he obtained his high school diploma in the year 2000.
