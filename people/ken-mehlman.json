Before joining KKR, Ken Mehlman was a Partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld, where he helped businesses and individuals manage risk and seize opportunities at the nexus of business and public policy.</p>\n\n<p>Ken Mehlman served as 62nd chairman of the Republican National Committee. He received his B.A. from Franklin and Marshall College in 1988 and his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1991.</p>\n\n<p>Since coming out in 2010 Mehlman has been an ardent supporter of equal rights. Ken Mehlman played a key role in the passage of the same-sex marriage law in New York. Mehlman reached out to conservative donors and operatives in an effort to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. In June 2011, Mehlman went to Albany to speak to leaders of New York&#8217;s legislature, where he encouraged lawmakers to vote in favor of same-sex marriage. Mehlman told the group, &#8220;There&#8217;s a strong Republican and conservative case to be made in favor of the right to marry.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mehlman often spoke with undecided GOP senators, including three of the four who eventually voted in favor of the bill. Mehlman, who gained the support of many prominent gay-rights backers, discussed the political and ideological reasons why lawmakers should vote for the bill. He said, &#8220;Letting two adults who love each other get married strengthens and promotes families.&#8221; Mehlman told the GOP senators that legalizing gay marriage aligned with the Republican interests and principles. He also emphasized that polls showed a significant shift toward voter support of gay marriage. Subsequently, the votes of the four Republican led to the end of a deadlock in the legislative session and made New York the largest and most influential state to adopt same-sex marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Ken Mehlman is a trustee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, and the National Endowment for Democracy. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and serves on the Senior Advisory Committee of the Harvard University Institute of Politics and the executive leadership cabinet of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Foundation.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Franklin and Marshall College","graduated_year":1988,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"JD","subject":"","institution":"Harvard Law School","graduated_year":1991,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Global Head of Public Affairs","firm":{"name":"Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.","permalink":"kohlberg-kravis-roberts-co","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chairman","firm":{"name":"Republican National Committee","permalink":"republican-national-committee","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"\t\t\t\t\t\t<table style='font:11px arial; color:#333; background-color:#f5f5f5' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='512' height='340'><tbody><tr style='background-color:#e5e5e5' valign='middle'><td style='padding:2px 1px 0px 5px;'><a target='_blank' style='color:#333; text-decoration:none; font-weight:bold;' href='http://www.thedailyshow.com'>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a></td><td style='padding:2px 5px 0px 5px; text-align:right; font-weight:bold;'>Mon - Thurs 11p / 10c</td></tr><tr style='height:14px;' valign='middle'><td style='padding:2px 1px 0px 5px;' colspan='2'><a target='_blank' style='color:#333; text-decoration:none; font-weight:bold;' href='http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-june-13-2006/ken-mehlman'>Ken Mehlman</a></td></tr><tr style='height:14px; background-color:#353535' valign='middle'><td colspan='2' style='padding:2px 5px 0px 5px; width:512px; overflow:hidden; text-align:right'><a target='_blank' style='color:#96deff; text-decoration:none; font-weight:bold;' href='http://www.thedailyshow.com/'>www.thedailyshow.com</a></td></tr><tr valign='middle'><td style='padding:0px;' colspan='2'><embed style='display:block' src='http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:cms:item:comedycentral.com:125818' width='512' height='288' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' wmode='window' allowFullscreen='true' flashvars='autoPlay=false' allowscriptaccess='always' allownetworking='all' bgcolor='#000000'></embed></td></tr><tr style='height:18px;' valign='middle'><td style='padding:0px;' colspan='2'><table style='margin:0px; text-align:center' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='100%' height='100%'><tr valign='middle'><td style='padding:3px; width:33%;'><a target='_blank' style='font:10px arial; color:#333; text-decoration:none;' href='http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/'>Daily Show Full Episodes</a></td><td style='padding:3px; width:33%;'><a target='_blank' style='font:10px arial; color:#333; text-decoration:none;' href='http://www.indecisionforever.com/'>Political Humor & Satire Blog</a></td><td style='padding:3px; width:33%;'><a target='_blank' style='font:10px arial; color:#333; text-decoration:none;' href='http://www.facebook.com/thedailyshow'>The Daily Show on Facebook</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","description":"<p>Ken Mehlman on the Daily Show</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ql61w4B-wak?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Ken Mehlman of KKR Discusses The Green Portfolio Project</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Gay-marriage-talk-1412502.php","title":"Ken Mehlman- Gay marriage talk"},{"external_url":"http://www.advocate.com/printArticle.aspx?id=207819","title":"Ken Mehlman Lobbies for New York Marriage"},{"external_url":"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/02/same_sex_opposite_impact/singleton/","title":"Ken Mehlman- Same sex, opposite impact"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.kkr.com/leadership/bios/KenMehlman.php","title":"Ken Mehlman at KKR"}]}
