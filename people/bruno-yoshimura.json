My first website was LinkGratis, a website directory.</p>\n\n<p>After some year, LinkGratis became top 50 in Brazil, with more than 20 million pageviews/month (nov/2006). The growth of the visits was only possible because I was one of the first to implement SEO in Brazil. In the same year, LinkGrÃ¡tis became the first case study in Google Brasil (sponsored links). </p>\n\n<p>In 2005 I launched the website Fotos de Pesca www.fotosdepesca.com.br (=&#8221;Fishing Pictures&#8221;), which quickly became one of the most visited website in its area. Fotos de Pesca is a collaborative website where users submit their photos. Currently, there are nearly 20 thousand photos.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006 I started my Internship in DRCLAs Harvard University, developing the new version of DRCLAS website (www.drclas.harvard.edu) and a web-based database of contacts (Mark Zuckerberg was working in the same project years before).</p>\n\n<p>In 2010 I founded the startup Kekanto.com with Fernando Okumura (CEO) and Allan Kajimoto (COO, since oct/2010), a social network of local businesses based on reviews. </p>\n\n<p>I am also interested in investments, particularly stock market and real estate for rent. My investments are based on fundamentals, cash flow and mathematics.
