Straight out of college Eric went to work as a Support Specialist for the international bank Schroder Wertheim. </p>\n\n<p>Right about this time the Interweb was taking off and Eric was looking to be a part of it. In late 1999 he landed a Systems Administrator job with Flooz.com. From the inside of their data center Eric helped to build Flooz&#8217;s technical infrastructure and really got to feel the rush of a startup. The excitement of these times appealed to him and it was here he decided one day to start his own venture.</p>\n\n<p>After the bursting of the bubble in 2001 Eric found a job at the national sales rep firm National Cable Communications (owned by Time Warner, Cox &amp; Comcast). At NCC Eric learned how to manage, how to create and maybe most importantly how to inspire. Although these traits are not always appreciated in the &#8220;corporate world&#8221; Eric had his sights set on putting them to good use with cubTales.com.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"cubTales.com","permalink":"cubtales-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0012/5365/125365v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0012/5365/125365v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,149],"assets/images/resized/0012/5365/125365v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/gogatz","title":""}]}
