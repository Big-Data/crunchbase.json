During that time he obtained his MSEE from the University of Texas at Austin, and through the relationships forged there, he became aware of the power of professional networking in terms of managing his own career.  Realizing that most technology professionals he knew did not actively network with their local industry colleagues, Matt decided to address that problem at the local level.  With the goal of building a career-oriented networking community of technology professionals with an Austin-focus, Matt started door64.com in 2007.  The community has grown to over 18,000 professionals in the Austin area, and Matt continues to hold face-to-face networking events that bring out hundreds of local technology professionals to network.  Matt is especially keen to help job seekers who are struggling to find employment, which is why the door64.com community thrives as members help each other during tough times through online conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Matt has spoken with countless job seekers who are spinning their wheels because they lack an infrastructure and process for conducting a successful job search.  In 2010 Matt joined JobCannon.com as CEO, and is working full-time to develop the tools and process for managing the job search, and engaging their network to find leads into the &#8220;hidden&#8221; market of unpublished jobs.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,149],"assets/images/resized/0010/0094/100094v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,149],"assets/images/resized/0010/0094/100094v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,149],"assets/images/resized/0010/0094/100094v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Steven Noreyko</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MSEE","subject":"Electrical Engineering","institution":"The University of Texas at Austin","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BSCE","subject":"Computer Engineering","institution":"Rochester Institute of Technology","graduated_year":1997,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"JobCannon","permalink":"jobcannon","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0010/0098/100098v2-max-150x150.png"],[[200,105],"assets/images/resized/0010/0098/100098v2-max-250x250.png"],[[200,105],"assets/images/resized/0010/0098/100098v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"Door64","permalink":"door64","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0011/2407/112407v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0011/2407/112407v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,83],"assets/images/resized/0011/2407/112407v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://brainshowerconsulting.com/blogs","title":"Online Community Blog"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/mgenovese","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
