He also\nstarted Gravitywell, an ASP based customer service solution, and Venturian, a subsidiary of ATIO\nCorporation, where Osman served as VP of Business Development and Marketing. Between\nstart-ups, Osman was Director of Business Development at Chordiant Software, Inc.\nSince its launch in 2003, Chegg has grown 25 times its original size. Osman was inspired to\nlaunch Chegg because he wanted college students to have convenient access to textbooks at a\nreasonable cost. Cheggâ€™s purpose is simple: Students donâ€™t need to purchase textbooks; they\nneed to be allowed to rent them.\nOsman holds a Bachelorâ€™s in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. He resides\nin Fremont CA with his wife and two daughters. One day, Osman hopes to climb to the summit of\nMount Kilimanjaro. Heâ€™ll get there.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder/CEO/Board of Directors","firm":{"name":"Kno","permalink":"kno","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,130],"assets/images/resized/0007/1060/71060v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0007/1060/71060v5-max-250x250.png"],[[263,228],"assets/images/resized/0007/1060/71060v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder and Chairman","firm":{"name":"Chegg","permalink":"chegg","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,104],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,187],"assets/images/resized/0002/8171/28171v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"angel","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1850000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Kno","permalink":"kno","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,130],"assets/images/resized/0007/1060/71060v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0007/1060/71060v5-max-250x250.png"],[[263,228],"assets/images/resized/0007/1060/71060v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
