He subsequently spent two and half years participating in the development of methane gas sensors based on near infrared diode lasers at the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, UK). During his current PhD research project on QC Lasers for gas sensing applications, Erwan developed, in collaboration with Prof. Duxbury and Dr. Langford, a novel technique, which led to the patent application GB0208100.8 being filed in April 2002. Erwan has also completed a post-graduate course in technology entrepreneurship at the Hunter Centre and is member of the Strathclyde Entrepreneurial Network (SEN).</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Scientific Officer","firm":{"name":"Cascade Technologies","permalink":"cascade-technologies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/5166/45166v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/5166/45166v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/5166/45166v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
