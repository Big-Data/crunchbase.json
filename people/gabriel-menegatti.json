Angel Investor ( http://br.linkedin.com/pub/gabriel-menegatti/7/b97/5a4 )</p>\n\n<p>During the past years, weâ€˜ve created and managed some successful (Software, Internet and Online Media) companies in Brazil. </p>\n\n<p>Detailed Background:\nI started working really young (with just 8 years old), helping my father on his food company.</p>\n\n<p>Rapidly I started to discover that â€œfood industryâ€ wasn&#8217;t the â€œmarket and futureâ€ for me, then, as media and technology is mainly necessary in every company, I started to study and learn everything possible about Media and Technology.</p>\n\n<p>GM2B Period:\nOn the beginning of 2001, after being involved in some online media companies and projects, I decided to launch my first company, called GM2B.</p>\n\n<p>GM2B was a Internet â€œstartupâ€ that developed and managed a successful free  web-hosting platform, called CriandoSite (CreatingSite).</p>\n\n<p>We build this project using the â€œfreemiumâ€ business model and, in the early beginning, CriandoSite demonstrated to be a really successful project, having more than 550.000 registered users and hosting more than 750.000 websites.</p>\n\n<p>During this period, CriandoSite generated more than 30 million of page impressions per day (almost 1 billion per month), where we normally sold advertisement.</p>\n\n<p>Later, during the â€œInternet Bubbleâ€, we sold our platform and customer base to a huge Brazilian ISP.</p>\n\n<p>FSD Mercosul (F-Secure Representative) Period:\nSome time after the CriandoSite project, I started to look for new ventures and opportunities, when we found F-Secure Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>So, beginning of 2004, when I visited the CeBIT event in Hannover (Germany), I had the opportunity to meet the F-Secure Corporation, considered as one of the biggest security companies in the world, that provides: digital security solutions and protection for online threads.</p>\n\n<p>After knowing the company better, I became interested in the solutions and I decided to bring the F-Secure Corporation to Brazil, which until then, was only represented by a single small reseller.\nSo, in the beginning of 2005, we launched the F-Secure Brasil official office, with just 10 professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2005, we created an company that (today):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Employs more than 65 professionals.</li>\n<li>Received more than 4 prizes from CRN magazine.</li>\n<li>Was elected as one of the best companies in Products and Services in Brazil.</li>\n<li>Sold and supporting to more than 5.000 medium and large (enterprise) companies in Brazil, such as: HONDA, BASF, Souza Cruz, Claro, Brazil Telecom, and others.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EmpÃ³rio de MÃ­dia Period:\nDuring the F-Secure growth in Brazil, I was â€œalmost obligatedâ€ to learn more about consumer behavioral, so, as we used many online marketing strategies to launch and build the F-Secure brand in Brazil, Iâ€˜ve decided to launch a new venture, called EmpÃ³rio de MÃ­dia.</p>\n\n<p>Today, EmpÃ³rio is one of the Top 5 Online Media Agencies in Brazil, providing online media planning, execution and monitoring for most of the biggest Ad Agencyâ€˜s on the market, such as: Ogilvy, WPP, Y&amp;R, JW Thompson, etc..</p>\n\n<p>EmpÃ³rio is the first and unique Media Planning Agency in Brazil, able to provide full and deep multiplatform behavioral targeting for advertisers and agency&#8217;s.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,93],"assets/images/resized/0012/9323/129323v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,155],"assets/images/resized/0012/9323/129323v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,280],"assets/images/resized/0012/9323/129323v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"EmpÃ³rio de MÃ­dia","permalink":"emprio-de-mdia","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"PagoPago","permalink":"pagopago","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0013/3890/133890v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/3890/133890v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0013/3890/133890v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"GM2B","permalink":"gm2b","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":800000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":3,"company":{"name":"PagoPago","permalink":"pagopago","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0013/3890/133890v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0013/3890/133890v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0013/3890/133890v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
