Membership of the BLN is restricted to owners of high growth businesses, corporates and a limited number of investors.</p>\n\n<p>He has been a part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the UK for over ten years and prior to the BLN he ran Library House which ran the first UK conference on Cleantech, created the Guardian Mediatech 100, the first comprehensive analysis of UK and European venture capital deals before that was fashionable. Library House was sold to Dow Jones.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Littlewood, like Lord Sugar, does not like bullshitters but unlike Lord Sugar, does not have a personalised numberplate. </p>\n\n<p>Mark has a blog that he is still puzzled why anyone would read but 20,000 people seem to every month but is grateful that they do.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/8991/108991v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[202,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/8991/108991v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[363,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/8991/108991v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Mark Littlewood</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=502467&locale=en_US&trk=tab_pro","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/marklittlewood","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/marklittlewood","title":"The Facebook thing"},{"external_url":"http://thebln.com","title":"The BLN"}]}
