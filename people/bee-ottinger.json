She invented modern video editing to music—quick cuts, jump cuts, visual effects, nonlinear montage—whose syntax is now the ubiquitous visual language used in commercials and music videos. Her style is familiar through MTV Networks and videos featuring Justin Timberlake, Janet Jackson, Cher, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez and many other artists, along with spots for Chrysler, Nike, Calvin Klein and Samsung, to name a few.  Previously, she founded cutting-edge Skylight Productions, acquired by Mad River Post, and was head of the National Avid User Group.</p>\n\n<p>At SnapCuts, users can combine video clips, add text and share custom messages via email, Facebook, twitter and mobile text:  a place to create, communicate and share thoughts with video.</p>\n\n<p>MUSIC VIDEOS:</p>\n\n<p>• kd lang, &#8220;Trail of Broken Hearts&#8221; (2006)\n• kd lang, &#8220;Pulling Back the Reins&#8221; (2006)\n• Chaka Khan, &#8220;Love You All of My Lifetime&#8221; (2006)\n• Omarion, &#8220;Touch&#8221; (2005)\n• N.E.R.D., &#8220;Rock Star&#8221; (2003) <em>Explicit</em>\n• Justin Timberlake, &#8220;Like I Love You&#8221; (2002)\n• Shakira, &#8220;Underneath Your Clothes&#8221; (2002)\n• N.E.R.D. &#8220;Provider&#8221; (2002)\n• Clipse, &#8220;Grindin&#8221; (2002)\n• The Exies, &#8220;My Goddess&#8221; (2002)\n• J.
