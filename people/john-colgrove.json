Coz was the primary architect for the hugely successful VERITAS Volume Manager (VxVM) and VERITAS File System (VxFS), and later served in various other engineering, management, and consultative roles. During his time at VERITAS Coz became one of the industry&#8217;s foremost experts on optimizing I/O streams and data structures for the unique idiosyncrasies of rotational hard drives, a challenge he&#8217;s now re-solving for solid state Flash memory. Prior to VERITAS, Coz was with Amdahl Corporation, where he was a key contributor to the development of the UTS mainframe UNIX operating system kernel. After leaving Symantec in 2008 to pursue personal interests, he joined Sutter Hill Ventures in the role of Entrepreneur in Residence. It was there he observed the growing acceptance of solid-state storage by enterprises that led him to co-found Pure Storage with John Hayes, with the goal of fully exploiting the advantages of the new technology. Coz is a graduate of Rutgers University, and holds over 70 patents in the areas of computer system and reliable data storage design.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,129],"assets/images/resized/0015/0331/150331v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[90,129],"assets/images/resized/0015/0331/150331v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[90,129],"assets/images/resized/0015/0331/150331v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Graduate ","subject":"","institution":"Rutgers University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CTO ","firm":{"name":"Pure Storage","permalink":"pure-storage","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0010/5732/105732v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0010/5732/105732v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0010/5732/105732v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
