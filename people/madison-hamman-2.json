After becoming deeply involved in the ideas Marc had been cultivating Madison was ready to take the project to the next level. A quick thinker and doer, Madison approached the owner of Samtec, Inc (a 480 million dollar, debt free company where Madison was employed) to seek financial backing.</p>\n\n<p>Since securing an investment agreement with Samtec, Inc, Madison has played an integral role in transforming Mavizon from a two-person idea house to a legitimate 17-person company.  He has directed the hardware design and development for Mavizonâ€™s flagship product, the Maviaâ„¢ connected car solution, led negotiations with Fortune 100 partners, recruited top technical talent, and served as the face of Mavizon Technologies for public relations and media requests. </p>\n\n<p>Madison often accepts public speaking engagements for industry events, networking groups, and local universities to share insights on starting a business, give advice to young professionals, or show off some of the projects in development at Mavizon. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,129],"assets/images/resized/0013/3411/133411v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,216],"assets/images/resized/0013/3411/133411v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,389],"assets/images/resized/0013/3411/133411v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"Marketing","institution":"University of Louisville","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"Mavizon","permalink":"mavizon-technologies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0013/4321/134321v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0013/4321/134321v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0013/4321/134321v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Business Development Manager","firm":{"name":"Mavizon","permalink":"mavizon-technologies","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0013/4321/134321v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0013/4321/134321v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0013/4321/134321v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/madisonhamman","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonhamman","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
