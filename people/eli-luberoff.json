Back in his hometown of Amherst, Mass, he remembers occasionally doing his brother&#8217;s math homework in elementary school in return for a ride to KFC. His motivation (aside from food) has always been a love for teaching. He started tutoring professionally in high school, and has been a volunteer/peer/professional tutor ever since.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Desmos","permalink":"desmos","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0012/8490/128490v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0012/8490/128490v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,153],"assets/images/resized/0012/8490/128490v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
