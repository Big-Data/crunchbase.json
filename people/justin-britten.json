Since his first job as a UNIX systems administrator at the age of sixteen, Justin has spent over 15 years in the hi-tech software industry.  Finally deciding to follow through with his entrepreneurial dreams he founded Prefinery in 2007 on the idea that excellent software is built in collaboration with your beta testers.  </p>\n\n<p>Justin is passionate about building, discovering, and using awesome software and encourages other young entrepreneurs to simply Build, Launch, and Tinker.  He is founder of the Entrepreneurs on Rails group in his home of Austin, Texas and when he can pry himself away from work enjoys traveling (he&#8217;s been to more than 30 countries), photography, cooking, and spending time outdoors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0005/1202/51202v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0005/1202/51202v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0005/1202/51202v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Electrical Engineering","institution":"University of Tennessee, Knoxville","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, President, CEO","firm":{"name":"Compulsivo","permalink":"compulsivo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/1694/21694v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/1694/21694v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[340,67],"assets/images/resized/0002/1694/21694v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/justinbritten","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jbritten","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://delicious.com/britten","title":"Delicious"}]}
