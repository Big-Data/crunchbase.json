The concept for BlogTalkRadio was developed by Levy as he mourned his father&#8217;s passing. Levy maintained a blog, www.theinspirationalvisit.blogspot.com to update his family and friends on his father&#8217;s health - and later as a memorial to his life. Levy thought by combining blogging and telecommunications, a true immediate two-way interactive online platform could be established. This led to the birth of BlogTalkRadio. In addition to BlogTalkRadio, Levy is a principal shareholder of XChange Telecommunications, a local telephone provider and myphonecompany.com, a VOIP company, both of which were founded in 2002. XChange powers BlogTalkRadioâ€™s telephone needs. From December 1999 to March 2000, Levy served as Chief Operating Officer at Viatel Inc. (NASDAQ â€“ VYTL), a facility based global telecommunications company. In December 1999, Viatel Inc acquired Destia Communications in an all stock transaction valued at $1.2 billion. Prior to Viatel Inc, Levy served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Destia Communications (NASDAQ - DEST) from July 1996 to December 1999. The company sold an array communications services including voice, data, and ISP services with sales operations in eleven countries including the US, UK and most of Western Europe. When Levy joined Destia in August 1996, the company had 40 employees in two countries, 10,000 customers and revenue of $2 million per month. Under Levyâ€™s leadership, Destia grew to 1200 employees, 550,000 customers (with a growth rate of 50,000 customers per quarter, and annual run rate revenue of $400 million). From October 1993 to July 1996, Levy held positions including Managing Director Europe, Executive VP of Legal and Finance, and Chief Financial Officer at Viatel. He joined the company after George Soros purchased a 20% minority stake in the company. During his tenure, the company raised more than $100 million to deploy a pan European fiber network and establish sales and marketing organizations throughout Western Europe. Prior to joining Viatel, Levy was a Certified Public Accountant in New York City.
