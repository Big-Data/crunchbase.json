Ashwin earned a dual B.A. from Claremont McKenna in Government and Economics.</p>\n\n<p>At BitTorrent, Ashwin Navin crafted a business model for the BitTorrent protocol, invented by his co-founder. With hopes of bringing BitTorrent out of the fringes and into the mainstream. Navin has assumed the public face of the company as an evangelist for its commercial viability. In 2007, Navin drove the acquisition of uTorrent and launched 3 commercial services: the BitTorrent Entertainment Network in February, the BitTorrent SDK in June, and BitTorrent DNA in October. </p>\n\n<p>To catalyze BitTorrent&#8217;s commercialization, Navin began by engaging movie industry executives directly. Although predicted by many to be highly unlikely, BitTorrent struck relationships with many major media companies including Time Warner, News Corp., Viacom, Lionsgate, Kadokawa Pictures, and others. He also signed the company&#8217;s first toolbar agreement which continues to be the company&#8217;s primary revenue stream. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/7655/17655v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[85,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/7655/17655v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[85,128],"assets/images/resized/0001/7655/17655v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Flingo","permalink":"flingo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[110,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/2559/172559v3-max-150x150.png"],[[110,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/2559/172559v3-max-250x250.png"],[[110,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/2559/172559v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","firm":{"name":"Crunchyroll","permalink":"crunchyroll","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0000/0160/160v21-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/0160/160v21-max-250x250.png"],[[450,83],"assets/images/resized/0000/0160/160v21-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Partner","firm":{"name":"i/o Ventures","permalink":"ventures","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0007/2403/72403v2-max-150x150.png"],[[156,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/2403/72403v2-max-250x250.png"],[[156,59],"assets/images/resized/0007/2403/72403v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Advisors","firm":{"name":"Scripped","permalink":"scripped","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/4848/24848v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,96],"assets/images/resized/0002/4848/24848v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,173],"assets/images/resized/0002/4848/24848v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Advisors","firm":{"name":"Mochi Media","permalink":"mochimedia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0000/1309/1309v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,188],"assets/images/resized/0000/1309/1309v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0000/1309/1309v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Advisors","firm":{"name":"OpenDNS","permalink":"opendns","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0002/2391/22391v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Advisors","firm":{"name":"Talenthouse","permalink":"talenthouse","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/8701/48701v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0004/8701/48701v5-max-250x250.png"],[[300,60],"assets/images/resized/0004/8701/48701v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President and Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"BitTorrent","permalink":"bittorrent","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/0743/10743v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0743/10743v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,192],"assets/images/resized/0001/0743/10743v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Corporate Development","firm":{"name":"Yahoo!","permalink":"yahoo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-150x150.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-250x250.png"],[[226,81],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
