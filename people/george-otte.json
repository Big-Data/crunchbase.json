A Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, Mr. Otte started his career as a network analyst for Gibraltar Bank in Coral Gables, Florida.  </p>\n\n<p>A driven entrepreneur, Mr. Otte quickly developed his own computer repair business at the age of 21.  His technicians assisted residential and small business clients, but Mr. Otte then took his company to the next level by being one of the first to repair computers remotely via the Internet.  This option allowed him the freedom he wanted to expand his customer base.  </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Otte, as a believer in â€œhands onâ€ management, is very involved in the daily operations of Geeks On Site.  This methodology has served him well: from the days when he had four employees, to now when he manages a staff of over 200 people in the U.S. and Peru.   </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Otte holds a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Business Management from Florida International University. He most recently visited China; and his other travel experiences have taken him to South America, Europe, the Caribbean and the Middle East, where he sought to develop a more global business view.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/2478/92478v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[178,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/2478/92478v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,350],"assets/images/resized/0009/2478/92478v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor's Degree","subject":"Business Management","institution":"Florida International University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Geeks On Site","permalink":"geeks-on-site","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0008/6106/86106v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,113],"assets/images/resized/0008/6106/86106v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,204],"assets/images/resized/0008/6106/86106v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/george-otte/20/283/439","title":"LinkedIn Profile"}]}
