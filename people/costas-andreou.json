He processes the sounds of fretted and fretless electric bass in real time, creating multi-level soundscapes. The organic instrument sound is processed with analog and digital effects and looped in real time, using various live looping techniques and a number of delay, feedback, tape and loop devices. The textures, the themes, the melodies and the soundscapes are created via improvisation and often are further processed during mixing. He has collaborated with musicians, film and theatre directors, actors, dancers, visual artists, online applications designers and new media artists. His music is available to preview and download from the iTunes Store worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>(source: Wikipedia)</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/2571/132571v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/2571/132571v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/2571/132571v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>costasandreou.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.itunes.com/costasandreou","title":"iTunes Store"}]}
