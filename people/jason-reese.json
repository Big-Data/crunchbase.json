Reese, provides a cross-pollination of fine art photography and photojournalism for his clients that has earned him a distinguished reputation in the wedding world. With an astute mastery of photography&#8217;s formal qualities and a vision seasoned by intuition and artistic mastery, Jason&#8217;s work appeals to the modern bride whose concerns are centered around simple, elegant images that compel and recite stories without words.</p>\n\n<p>Services include - Wedding, Corporate Event, Editorial, Architecture, Commercial, Portrait, Fine Art, Travel, and Stock Photography.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;My approach to all photographic/visual projects is always unique, as it is tailored to the client&#8217;s needs, expectations, and personal vision.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I embark upon assignments relying most heavily on my visual intuition; a curious and discerning eye that has been refined by many years of formal training and education. I&#8217;m interested in not only meeting my client&#8217;s expectations, but more importantly, surpassing them.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;My personal style could be summed up as visceral and evocative. I believe my images to be distinctive due to the blending and integration of various photographic disciplines to which my eye has been trained, i.e. commercial, documentary, and fine art.&#8221;</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,98],"assets/images/resized/0013/9136/139136v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,164],"assets/images/resized/0013/9136/139136v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,296],"assets/images/resized/0013/9136/139136v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Interactive Media Design / Photography","institution":"USI","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/23553945?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"268\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/23553945\">Time-lapse Photography</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/photorexit\">Jason Reese</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","description":"<p>Time-lapse Photography</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/DEF-jvK4Ws8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Architectural Photography</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QZkidK9GHoM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Wedding Photography</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
