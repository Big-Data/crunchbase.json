PayByGroup is a 500 Startups company, and Camilo&#8217;s second venture with Frank Langston.</p>\n\n<p>Before starting PayByGroup, Camilo and Frank started Root Orange, a domain-splitting business that allowed a different business in every city to use the exact same domain name at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to that, Camilo worked for his momâ€™s government communications company,The Media Network, where he introduced newfangled tools young people use like Facebook and Twitter to the companyâ€™s communications offerings.  Years later, the federal government is still figuring out how to use social media.  He also oversaw the companyâ€™s website re-design, which introduced him to the headache of website re-design.  Camiloâ€™s previous gigs include stints at the Corporate Executive Board and New Vantage Group, a venture capital firm in Northern Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>During the rare times he is not working, Camilo does fundraising and advocacy work for education reform efforts, a cause both he and Frank fervently support.  He was almost assaulted once by an angry mob of fired (read: low-performing) public school teachers while testifying at a D.C. City Council hearing.  Camilo enjoyed the experience and The Washington Post found it newsworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Camilo received his B.A. in Politics from Princeton University, where his thesis on micro-finance in South Africa inexplicably managed to receive the Picard Prize. He is a graduate of the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C, where he enjoyed pasta dinners with Al Gore at the Vice Presidentâ€™s residence and seeing Hillary Clinton in frumpy mom clothes.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"PayByGroup","permalink":"paybygroup","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/9844/159844v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/9844/159844v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/9844/159844v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-President","firm":{"name":"Root Orange","permalink":"root-orange","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
