He developed and sold a customized PSP (Playstation Portable) software on eBay that enabled the device to play open-source free games. After selling a couple hundred units over a summer, Adam was inspired to continue his entrepreneurial activities. </p>\n\n<p>A few years later Adam made a similar open source software for the iPhone and started selling iPhones in bulk both on eBay and Craigslist. But he still wasn&#8217;t satisfied despite having six figures in the bank. He wanted to create something unique that he could call his own. </p>\n\n<p>Enter Swapidy.</p>\n\n<p>Being an avid eBay seller for several years, Adam realized the amount of money he lost in fees was quite substantial. Not only do sites like eBay charge a hefty fee for selling an item - there&#8217;s a second charge for transmitting the payment via Paypal. On top of that, add shipping costs. Finally, the value of a product depreciates by 15-20 percent when you sell secondhand online.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of buying and selling on eBay in pursuit of saving on fees, Adam turned to local classifieds such as Craigslist. Although Craigslist is a great option for local commerce, it certainly isn&#8217;t the safest or the most reliable. Adam found that many times, he&#8217;d have to drive hours to supposedly get an amazing deal to find out when he got there, the person was a no show or a weirdo.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, Adam created his vision of an online trading hub free from the problems of eBay or Craigslist. &#8220;I wanted a place where I could not only get amazing deals like you can on Craigslist, but where I could have a seamless experience similar to eBay with lower fees.&#8221;</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","firm":{"name":"Swapidy","permalink":"swapidy","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,103],"assets/images/resized/0020/0656/200656v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0020/0656/200656v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,173],"assets/images/resized/0020/0656/200656v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://libertyville.suntimes.com/13669010-417/libertyville-teen-launches-trading-site-i-think-this-can-be-the-next-ebay.html","title":"Sun Times Article"},{"external_url":"http://lakeforest.patch.com/articles/libertyville-teen-starts-online-trading-site-3cfdb2f7","title":"Patch Article"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.adamahmad.me","title":"About"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/theswapdaddy","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/Adamdaman25","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=115330389&locale=en_US&trk=tab_pro","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
