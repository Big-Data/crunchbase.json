It took him six months to realize he had no idea what he was doing. After a few days of soul searching, he decided to push forward spending the next 12 months learning to become an entrepreneur. The highlight (and often lowlight) of the journey was teaching himself to build websites (Python/Django).</p>\n\n<p>Before working in finance, he graduated from Harvard College in 2003 with a degree in Applied Mathematics.</p>\n\n<p>He is a mentor at TechStars. He shares the lessons he learned as a first-time entrepreneur on twitter and his blog: http://vacanti.me</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4958/34958v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/4958/34958v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/4958/34958v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"AB","subject":"Applied Mathematics","institution":"Harvard College","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"UnHub","permalink":"unhub","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0003/7564/37564v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/7564/37564v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/7564/37564v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder/CEO","firm":{"name":"Yipit","permalink":"yipit","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0010/4332/104332v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/4332/104332v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,106],"assets/images/resized/0010/4332/104332v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"140it","permalink":"140it","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/4867/34867v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/4867/34867v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/4867/34867v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://viniciusvacanti.com","title":"Blog"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/vacanti","title":"Twitter"}]}
