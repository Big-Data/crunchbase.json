Growing up in Michigan, Fred was an avid participant in high school sports, church activities, and community projects and this established a solid foundation for personal development and community service that he has followed throughout his life. </p>\n\n<p>Fredâ€™s academic achievements and skills on the basketball court interested the recruiters at Grand Valley State University where he graduated in 1973 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Science, emphasis on behavioral sciences, and earned NAIA All-American honors for basketball. He then continued his studies at Western Michigan University and earned his Masterâ€™s Degree that same year with an emphasis on counseling psychology. After beginning his professional career and starting a family, Fred attended Columbia University in New York City where he earned a Doctorate in Education in 1987 with an emphasis on corporate training and development. His doctoral dissertation, â€œLearning in the Workplaceâ€, was published that same year.</p>\n\n<p>Fredâ€™s professional career began not in academia, but on the polished hardwood of professional basketball courts where he played for five years and won three championships in the Continental Basketball Association. After retiring from professional sports, he accepted executive director positions in the ensuing years with several health organizations where he was responsible for the development and implementation of corporate-based wellness programs and employee health services. </p>\n\n<p>Fred then applied his management and interpersonal skills to a consulting position with a national consulting firm which provided healthcare and organizational development consulting services to Fortune 500 companies such as Motorola, Southwestern Bell, AT&amp;T, and many others. In 1986, he branched out on his own and founded Roh Investment Consultants, an investment firm specializing in raising capital for start-up ventures as well as employee benefits consulting and financial services for employers and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>In 1993, he co-founded and was president of a national physician networking organization which included membership of over 18,000 physicians in all 50 states which served over 25 million patients across the country. From 2006 to the present, Fred has been a Managing Member of a payroll management firm which provides services for over 100 employers with 2000 employees. Continuing his dedication to his faith and his community, Fred also serves as a Group Leadership Training Director for his church in Arizona.</p>\n\n<p>Fred is on the Board of Directors for several local sports organizations and community high schools where his children attend and has served as a basketball coach for many years helping high school athletes further their education and prepare for college scholarships and athletic competition. Heâ€™s been married for 18 years and lives in Scottsdale, AZ, with his wife and four children where they attend the Camelback Bible Church. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
