At one time, he managed 15-20 tenants/roommates and operated 3 rental properties in the Inland Empire while working a full-time job as a programmer for a Defense company in San Diego. He discovered from using other services such as Craigslist, placing classified ad in the local PennySaver, and signing up to other roommate matching service where they charge membership fee for an inbox, were like fishing with his bare hands. The good ones seem to slip away. He had problems with these other services, then in 2010, he began coding Roomplug from the ground up.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"UCSD","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Roomplug","permalink":"roomplug","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0014/6847/146847v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,88],"assets/images/resized/0014/6847/146847v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[282,100],"assets/images/resized/0014/6847/146847v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rodney-nguyen/7/876/790","title":"Linkedin"}]}
