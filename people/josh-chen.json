Josh continued to hone his programming skills which landed him an engineering position at Newegg.com. Most recently, Josh led the development, launch and scaling of Yintai.com (a popular fashion e-commerce site in China) as the site grew from $0 to $50 million in sales. Josh has been building full-stack, massive e-commerce platforms for 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Monogram, Josh founded Packagetrackr.com (a side project) and grew the site to 2 million monthly page views and 40,000 registered users.
