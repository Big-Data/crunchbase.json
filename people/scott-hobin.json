I started my networking career in 1997 at a Gold value added reseller for Cisco Systems, Planetary Networks.  I focused on large enterprise and service provider networks from the core to the edge.   In 2001, I started Hula Networks with my two business partners,  Steve Robinson and Joe Commendatore.   As a business owner and acting CFO my responsibilities and skill sets focus on operations, accounting, and sales.  My areas of data IP network expertise include design and integration in enterprise campus WAN and LAN environments, core routing and switching, data center build outs, and WAN acceleration, application control, sever load balancing, wireless, security, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Hula&#8217;s mission is to help our clients increase profits, decrease expenses, and mitigate risk. We work hard to increase our client&#8217;s productivity and revenues by addressing the gaps in their current communication infrastructure and company procedures. Hula Networks takes great pride in introducing the right technology to our clients while factoring their specific business needs and budgetary restraints into the equation. We focus on designing, installing and supporting the network infrastructure that is best for our clients needs. </p>\n\n<p>I am highly responsive, excellent with follow up, accountable, customer centric, knowledgeable on technologies from the desk top to the cloud.

I also enjoy mountain biking, snowboarding, photography, cooking, and of course spending time with family.
