As a computational psychologist of science, Dr. Shrager seeks to understand how science works and how technological platforms can be designed to fit the way science actually operates. As CTO, he&#8217;s applying these concepts to biomedicine and drug discovery to create a technical platform that supports all the managerial and operational tasks of virtual pharmas.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to his role at CommerceNet, Dr. Shrager is an associate professor in the Symbolic Systems program at Stanford University. He&#8217;s also the primary investigator on the BioBike project, a Web-based, programmable biological knowledgebase that enables biologists to manipulate biological data, develop computational methods, and then deploy those methods immediately to working biologists.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining CommerceNet, Dr. Shrager worked for Powerset, a CommerceNet-funded company focused on building a transformative consumer search engine based on natural language processing. He was also a research fellow at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of Plant Biology at Stanford. Work originating out of the department has resulted in novel intelligent methods for genome assembly, as well as Microarray and biological pathway analysis.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[101,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/9103/29103v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[101,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/9103/29103v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[101,103],"assets/images/resized/0002/9103/29103v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","firm":{"name":"CommerceNet","permalink":"commercenet","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/9066/29066v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[75,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/9066/29066v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[75,87],"assets/images/resized/0002/9066/29066v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
