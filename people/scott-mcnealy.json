In 1982, McNealy, who was then manufacturing director at Onyx Systems, a vendor of microprocessor-based Unix systems, was approached by fellow Stanford alumnus Khosla to help provide the necessary organizational and business leadership for the fledgling company. The name &#8220;Sun&#8221; was derived from Bechtolsheim&#8217;s original SUN computer project.</p>\n\n<p>In 1984, McNealy took over the CEO role from Khosla, who would ultimately leave the company in 1985. On 24 April 2006, McNealy stepped down as CEO after serving in that position for 22 years, and turned the job over to Jonathan Schwartz.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most people who become involved in high technology industries, Scott McNealy did not come from the world of amateur programmers, hackers, and computer scientists. Instead, his background was in business, having earned a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Harvard and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Prior to college, he graduated from Cranbrook Schools in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where his father was in the automotive industry; most of his work experience prior to joining Sun was in automotive manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2009, Oracle bought Sun Microsystems for an estimated $5.6 billion.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,115],"assets/images/resized/0012/1467/121467v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,192],"assets/images/resized/0012/1467/121467v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,308],"assets/images/resized/0012/1467/121467v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Economics ","institution":"Harvard University ","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Economics ","institution":"Harvard University ","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board","firm":{"name":"Sun Microsystems","permalink":"sun-microsystems","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0001/6586/16586v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/6586/16586v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,86],"assets/images/resized/0001/6586/16586v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Hardcore Computer","permalink":"hardcore-computer","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0008/3334/83334v1-max-150x150.png"],[[249,63],"assets/images/resized/0008/3334/83334v1-max-250x250.png"],[[249,63],"assets/images/resized/0008/3334/83334v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Crucial Point","permalink":"crucial-point","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0009/1772/91772v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0009/1772/91772v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,62],"assets/images/resized/0009/1772/91772v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Nyoombl","permalink":"nyoombl","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0011/9841/119841v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0011/9841/119841v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[423,144],"assets/images/resized/0011/9841/119841v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Greenplum Software","permalink":"greenplum","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0000/3256/3256v1-max-150x150.png"],[[173,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/3256/3256v1-max-250x250.png"],[[173,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/3256/3256v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/02/vungle-hustles-its-way-into-2m-seed-round-from-all-star-investors-for-mobile-app-video-trailers/","source_description":"Vungle Hustles Its Way Into $2M All-Star Seed Round For Mobile App Video Trailers Network","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":2,"company":{"name":"Vungle","permalink":"vungle","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0012/2446/122446v2-max-150x150.png"],[[163,75],"assets/images/resized/0012/2446/122446v2-max-250x250.png"],[[163,75],"assets/images/resized/0012/2446/122446v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}},{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/nebula-raises-25m-from-comcast-kleiner-perkins-to-help-companies-deploy-on-premise-private-clouds/","source_description":"Nebula Raises $25M From Comcast, Kleiner Perkins To Help Companies Deploy On-Premise, Private Clouds","raised_amount":25000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":5,"company":{"name":"Nebula","permalink":"nebula","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0016/0132/160132v10-max-150x150.png"],[[250,83],"assets/images/resized/0016/0132/160132v10-max-250x250.png"],[[450,149],"assets/images/resized/0016/0132/160132v10-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://mashpedia.com/Scott_McNealy","title":"Scott McNealy at Mashpedia"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/search/smcnealy","title":"Scott McNealy on Twitter"}],"web_presences":[]}
