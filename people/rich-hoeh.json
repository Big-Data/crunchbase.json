On October 28, 2010 I want to set a new world record for organ donations. I need some people to help me spread the word. I am a painter not a programmer.                                                                             When I told the Transplant Group at the Peidmont Hospital in Atlanta, Ga they burst into applause, nurses and doctors included. The man sitting beside me was only 40 and has been called to the hospital twice so far and he and his wife are still waiting for a liver for him. Please help.                                                          Only 1 in every 4 people who need a liver get one. The others die waiting. I cannot change this alone. Please contact me at NewLife4Rich@gmail.com.      Thank You</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
