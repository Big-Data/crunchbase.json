Ferrell has over 25 years of business experience, including the successful launch and development of four startup companies. A CPA, Pat&#8217;s early career was primarily focused on finance and operations. Diverging from this background, Pat founded GamePro magazine in 1988, and, after selling the company to IDG in 1989, stayed with them for 9 years as he built Infotainment World to over $50 million in revenues. During this time, Pat also created and launched E3, the world&#8217;s largest trade show launch. Following his departure from IDG in 1997, Pat then co-founded the first true social networking company, SocialNet, which was sold in 2000. Pat&#8217;s most recent startup was the creation of the first teen-only fitness/wellness center, which is currently operating in Mountain View, CA. In the 18 years Pat has been a CEO, he has fostered his expertise in business development, marketing/branding, consumer products, and the Internet and media industries.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,135],"assets/images/resized/0014/5757/145757v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[135,135],"assets/images/resized/0014/5757/145757v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[135,135],"assets/images/resized/0014/5757/145757v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder ","firm":{"name":"Zenergo","permalink":"zenergo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/2418/102418v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/2418/102418v2-max-250x250.png"],[[376,129],"assets/images/resized/0010/2418/102418v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
