Previously, he was senior vice president and general manager of the Data Center and Cloud Division at Citrix, having joined that company in 2007 by way of its $500 million acquisition of XenSource, a provider of open-source virtualization sofware, where he was CEO. XenSource&#8217;s customers included Microsoft, Symantec, HP, NEC and Dell.\nThis will be Levine&#8217;s second go in the venture capital ring. He spent three years as a general partner at the Mayfield Fund and in that capacity served on the board of Consera Software, which was purchased by HP. He sat on the advisory board of VMWare and was an investor in Actona, which was ultimately acquired by Cisco Systems.</p>\n\n<p>Levine first rose to prominence as an early employee of Veritas Software, and during his 11-year stint there helped to grow it to 5,000+ and more than $1.5B in annual revenue. His last job at Veritas was executive VP, where he was responsible for worldwide marketing, OEM sales, business development and several product divisions. Before that, he was a software engineer at MIT and worked on Project Athena, an early-1980s research project to build a campus-wide distributed computing network that turned out to be a forerunner of the kind of corporate networks we now use every day.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0014/8091/148091v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0014/8091/148091v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[275,182],"assets/images/resized/0014/8091/148091v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Andreessen Horowitz","permalink":"andreessen-horowitz","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0006/5679/65679v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/5679/65679v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[432,212],"assets/images/resized/0006/5679/65679v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","firm":{"name":"Udacity","permalink":"udacity","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,12],"assets/images/resized/0018/2446/182446v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,21],"assets/images/resized/0018/2446/182446v1-max-250x250.png"],[[290,25],"assets/images/resized/0018/2446/182446v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
