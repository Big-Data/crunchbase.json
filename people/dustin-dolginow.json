Entering the space with only an idea, a modicum of savings and lots of passion, Dustin found a technical partner, iterated through several prototypes and became a practitioner of lean startup practices. The site continues as a side project and reminder of the challenges of building a sustainable web company.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to entering early stage tech, Dustin began his career at Lehman Brothers, working within the Investment Banking Division on structured finance products. His three years on Wall Street provided a world of experience in global capital markets, fixed income instruments and various liquidity structures.</p>\n\n<p>Dustin completed his B.A from Middlebury College in 2006. He graduated with high honors as an International Politics and Economics Major. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[104,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/2032/92032v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[173,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/2032/92032v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[312,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/2032/92032v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Lehman Brothers","permalink":"lehman-brothers","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0001/1387/11387v1-max-150x150.png"],[[219,32],"assets/images/resized/0001/1387/11387v1-max-250x250.png"],[[219,32],"assets/images/resized/0001/1387/11387v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Barclays Capital","permalink":"barclays-capital","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/8830/48830v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/8830/48830v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,157],"assets/images/resized/0004/8830/48830v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
