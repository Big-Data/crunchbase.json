He began coding in college and at the age of 20, developed an online learning system for engineers. Leo earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering and MIS at Kettering University in Michigan and with the help of a professor, his software was acquired by the Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC). He soon took on several leadership roles across the development, marketing, sales and services organizations during his tenure with PTC where he developed strong skills in product development. Leo was responsible for bridging the gap between technology and business through his work with companies such as NASA, Boeing, and Ferrari. He then joined the Trigo acquisition of IBM and went on to lead IBM Rationalâ€™s global software sales relationships with IBMâ€™s marquee technology customers, including Intel, Cisco, HP, Oracle and eBay and helped them develop better software.
