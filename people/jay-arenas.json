They are professional, prompt and exceedingly talented.&#8221;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Darren Hardy | Entrepreneur, Investor, Publisher SUCCESS Magazine</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>â€œJay Arenas and his team are hands down the absolute best in the market! Jay was very responsive to all correspondence, a refreshing experience in customer service. Their intuitive designing, quick delivery and pride of product made our entire transaction a pleasurable and stress-free experience. Not only have I recommended them to my other colleagues but we will be back in the future for other projects!!â€\n-Todd Greenwood, Chief Executive Officer | Titanium Cobra Solutions</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I use Jay Arenas for my clients that ask me for web and logo designs. No Matter who I have sent to them, they have provided superior quality results, always ahead of schedule and at a price that I cannot beat. Cheaper priced companies have disappointed me 100% of the time, fixing and redoing projects over and over&#8230;.Yet Jay and his staff always shine. ALWAYS THE BEST VALUE you can find in these areas.&#8221;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mark Dennis, Owner | AllCalls4Business (AC4B)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#8220;Being a consultant I often have several projects going on at once and I need to be able to ramp up quickly and have short turn around times. The team at June Spring Multimedia was a real pleasure to work with and very responsive and helpful.&#8221;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jason Brinkerhoff | President and CEO at TAO Consulting Group</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#8220;I had made various attempts in the past to have a logo made for my business with other vendors but was not happy with the results. Wow, on the very first try they nailed it. The logo was creative and professional and represented what I wanted for my firm. I highly recommend Jay to other organizations. They are professional, creative and they deliver results quickly. Their prices are also very fair and competitive.&#8221;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Karen Parsons, President | Successful Solutions Life Coaching</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>â€œI can now say I have had the pleasure of working with Jay. His services are excellently priced and with amazing turn around times.. I had Jay and his graphics team build a corporate logo for a business partner of mine and we were very pleased with the finished product. The final product was very eye catching and exactly what we had envisioned prior to doing business. I would trust Jay with any project no matter how big or small and his level of expertise in his field is astounding. I recommend Jay to any of my graphic needing clients and will return to do more business with him soon. (His turn around time for my project was eleven hours!)&#8221;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sean Strate, Co-Owner/CMO &amp; EVP | Correlation Enterprises</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>â€œThis is our first project with June Spring Multimedia and it won&#8217;t be the last. Fast! Creative! Great Price! Jay and the team at June Spring Multimedia, are experts in creative media. I highly recommend their services.â€</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>John Bellamy, Managing Director | Global Network Builder</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>â€œRecommendation for Arturo &#8220;Jay&#8221; Arenas-Vergara II: I was fortunate to connect with Jay via LinkedIn. Jay noticed that I did not have a website and intuitively concluded that I may not have a logo as well. He was correct. We chatted briefly through e.mail and with in a day he had three mock ups ready for me to review. The mock ups were excellent, and two our of three were perfect, but I would gladly use any of them. Jay seems to be very astute to people, both by circumstances and, somehow, through their expressions via e.mail. We have never spoke, but somehow, he hit the nail right on the head. I also believe that if Jay (and team) did not get a mock up right the first time, he&#8217;d get it the second. I don&#8217;t believe he needs much to work with as he and his team are very talents.&#8221;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jay E Gonzalez, CEO | JEX Consulting</li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/6992/126992v4-max-150x150.png"],[[249,249],"assets/images/resized/0012/6992/126992v4-max-250x250.png"],[[249,249],"assets/images/resized/0012/6992/126992v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"June Spring Multimedia","permalink":"june-spring-multimedia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0012/9159/129159v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,134],"assets/images/resized/0012/9159/129159v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,241],"assets/images/resized/0012/9159/129159v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eQ92sBrQolY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://quorumm.com/team/jay_arenas.htm","title":"Quorumm Digital Venture Partners - Jay Arenas, Senior Advisor - APAC"},{"external_url":"http://ph.linkedin.com/in/jayarenas","title":"LinkedIn Profile"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.junespringmultimedia.com","title":"Logo Design"},{"external_url":"http://www.junespringmultimedia.com/blog","title":"Blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/junespringmultimedia","title":"Fan Page"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/junespring","title":"Twitter"}]}
