Chris is known for developing a radically new and successful approach to Automated Image Review. In his &#8220;AIR&#8221; program, he pioneered a way to monetize MySpace&#8217;s most underutilized resource &#8211; an untapped, multi-petabyte image repository and daily image influx. Working with vendors and the MySpace Product team, he developed a system to automatically process incoming images, taxonomy, eliminating harmful and illegal content &#8211; saving more than $10 million per year after cost.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to MySpace, Chris was with Intel for nearly 17 years where he was a senior engineering manager. Working his way up quickly through the ranks through Intel&#8217;s corporate automation teams, Chris was a software engineer, database dbms developer, robotics interface and statistical process controls developer, project manager, and software engineering manager. He developed loading, ETL, and reporting systems for multi-terabyte, world-wide distributed database systems, often writing the DBMS systems by hand.

Their MIS program has been ranked No. 1 in the U.S. since its inception. He received a Chevron Academic Scholarship, was president of the student organization  (MISA), and received the singular &#8220;Outstanding Undergraduate Award&#8221; in his graduating class. After college, Chris joined Digital Equipment Corporation as a programmer/analyst where he greatly enjoyed working with some of the brightest technologists in the internet and software industry before the minicomputer apocalypse led him to work for Intel for the majority of his career. Chris lives and works in Los Angeles. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[92,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2956/82956v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[153,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2956/82956v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,293],"assets/images/resized/0008/2956/82956v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSBA - cum laude","subject":"Management Information Systems","institution":"University of Arizona","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Analytics","firm":{"name":"ValueClick","permalink":"valueclick","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/7115/27115v1-max-150x150.png"],[[138,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/7115/27115v1-max-250x250.png"],[[138,73],"assets/images/resized/0002/7115/27115v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President / Owner","firm":{"name":"MM2Analytics","permalink":"mm2analytics","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Sr. Engineering Manager","firm":{"name":"Intel","permalink":"intel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,165],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,297],"assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Engineering","firm":{"name":"MySpace","permalink":"myspace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President / Architect","firm":{"name":"ZuumBe","permalink":"zuumbe","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Consulting Director Analytics & BI","firm":{"name":"Grindr","permalink":"grindr","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/9349/39349v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9349/39349v7-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0003/9349/39349v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Engineer","firm":{"name":"DEC","permalink":"dec","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Sr Director of Socialization, Analytics, Engineering","firm":{"name":"TiBesti","permalink":"tibesti","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Analytics and Business Intelligence","firm":{"name":"Outlook Amusements","permalink":"outlook-amusements","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/christopher.bridges","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.tibesti.com","title":"TiBesti"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/cebridges","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
