Bonobo applications have been featured in the New York Times and CNN as well as topping the App Store charts in several countries, both paid and free. Bonobo is a self funded company and was nominated for a 2010 Webby Award.</p>\n\n<p>In my previous role as Director of Sales for The Foundry, I relocated from our London office to Los Angeles to set up and run the American sales &amp; support office for this rapidly growing visual effects software company. I generated Â£4m in sales for clients including Sony, Dreamworks SKG &amp; Industrial Light &amp; Magic (Lucasfilm). I have a track record in beating performance targets, and contributed to the company growing 300% during this period.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/1429/201429v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/1429/201429v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/1429/201429v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Yoink!","permalink":"yoink","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[61,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/0541/200541v2-max-150x150.png"],[[61,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/0541/200541v2-max-250x250.png"],[[61,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/0541/200541v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
