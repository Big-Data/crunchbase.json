When the brutal winds blow, the lithe tree&#8217;s branches sway and bend, and the tree survives. A bigger, stronger tree, unable to adapt to the gusts, is snapped or blown out of the ground. Similarly in judo, use of skill and speed can win out over brute force, and a smaller opponent can prevail through quickness, cunning and superior technique.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/9106/199106v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0019/9106/199106v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0019/9106/199106v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Investor&#8217;s Day</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Catholical University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","firm":{"name":"Opara","permalink":"opara","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0019/8976/198976v2-max-150x150.png"],[[206,118],"assets/images/resized/0019/8976/198976v2-max-250x250.png"],[[206,118],"assets/images/resized/0019/8976/198976v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://br.linkedin.com/in/gustavomonteiro","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/gfmonteiro_","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://github.com/gustavomonteiro","title":"GitHub"}]}
