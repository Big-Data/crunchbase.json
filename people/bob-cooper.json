Over the past 10 years he has also led two turn-arounds of VC-backed companies and helped a number of entrepreneurs establish funding.</p>\n\n<p>In 1991 Cooper founded Frontier Media Group, Inc., one of the earliest interactive marketing firms in the country. Over the next seven years he grew that firm to be one of the largest and most profitable interactive agencies in North America. Ultimately, he sold the firm to a NASDAQ listed company which was soon thereafter acquired by Qwest Communications.</p>\n\n<p>In his current role at Frontier Service Design, he seeks to raise awareness around the growing discipline of service design. With 70% of the U.S. gross domestic product now based on services, it is imperative that we understand how to consciously design services with as much care and detail as is applied to product design.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0003/6832/36832v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0003/6832/36832v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0003/6832/36832v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"Journalism","institution":"Indiana University of Pennsylvania","graduated_year":1983,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"NeighborOil","permalink":"neighboroil","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0013/6706/136706v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,94],"assets/images/resized/0013/6706/136706v6-max-250x250.png"],[[396,149],"assets/images/resized/0013/6706/136706v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Frontier Service Design","permalink":"frontier-service-design","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0003/6737/36737v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[204,86],"assets/images/resized/0003/6737/36737v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[204,86],"assets/images/resized/0003/6737/36737v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.dailylocal.com/articles/2009/01/14/business/srv0000004487638.txt","title":"New Business Has Designs on Service"},{"external_url":"http://www.dailylocal.com/articles/2009/01/14/business/srv0000004487638.txt","title":"New business has designs on service"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/rtcooper","title":"LinkedIN"}]}
