After previously being a signed musician and running his own independent record label, Marcus has built a firm understanding on developing musicians and helping them succeed in the music industry.</p>\n\n<p>How Did You Get Into the Music Industry?\nMy interest in the music industry began in high school when I began playing drums in a hard rock band. Over the years I realised that succeeding as a musician wasn&#8217;t anything easy, but like many of musicians that I meet through this website, I knew that my drive and passion would get me there, eventually! </p>\n\n<p>After years of learning how to market myself and an ever so slight shift in genre to writing progressive trance (..okay maybe not so slight!) I eventually got my music released with several record labels all around the world and launched my own independent record label called Starharbour Records. Within less than a year the record label was established as an innovative and respected UK independent and was attracting major record label A&amp;R scouts and well-known artist&#8217;s on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009 I began writing The Musician&#8217;s Guide to World Domination and building this website to share the knowledge on succeeding in the music industry that I gained from managing and marketing musicians. </p>\n\n<p>I am now a social media marketing executive for one of the leading digital marketing agencies in the UK and continue to create resources, video courses, tools and provide music marketing consulting for musicians all over the world. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0008/7824/87824v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,247],"assets/images/resized/0008/7824/87824v6-max-250x250.png"],[[361,357],"assets/images/resized/0008/7824/87824v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Marcus Taylor</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"The Musician's Guide","permalink":"the-musicians-guide","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[137,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6610/86610v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/6610/86610v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[413,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/6610/86610v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Social Media","firm":{"name":"SEOptimise","permalink":"seoptimise","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0005/7765/57765v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0005/7765/57765v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/7765/57765v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Toy Transport","permalink":"toy-transport","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.themusiciansguide.co.uk","title":"The Musician's Guide"},{"external_url":"http://www.wegetnoticed.com","title":"Get Noticed"},{"external_url":"http://www.marcus-taylor.net","title":"Marcus Taylor"}]}
