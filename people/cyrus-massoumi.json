Massoumi struggled for four painful days to find a doctor, and became convinced that a better healthcare system is possible. He has extensive experience in the healthcare-technology nexus, web commerce and management.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to ZocDoc, Massoumi served as an Engagement Manager at the global management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, where he focused on healthcare and technology. Massoumi’s four-year tenure at McKinsey &amp; Co. began soon after his 2003 graduation from Columbia University, where he earned an MBA and received the Heffernan Award for Outstanding Service.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, Massoumi founded his first business, a web startup specializing in e-commerce management tools. During the prior year, he worked in Austin, Texas, for Trilogy Software, which recruited Massoumi upon his graduation from the Wharton School cum laude. </p>\n\n<p>Massoumi currently resides in Manhattan, New York. A native of Florida, Massoumi once served as a staffer for a US Senator. He also worked at Disney World, where he learned important lessons about customer service. </p>\n\n<p>Massoumi first met ZocDoc founder and Chief Technology Officer Nick Ganju when the two shared a desk at Trilogy Software. He met ZocDoc founder and COO Dr. Oliver Kharraz several years later, when they collaborated on a project at McKinsey &amp; Company. Massoumi’s most proud and humbling distinction to date is ZocDoc’s recognition by Crain’s New York Business as the Best Place to Work in New York.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/9640/9640v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0000/9640/9640v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0000/9640/9640v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"","institution":"The Wharton School","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Columbia University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO/Founder","firm":{"name":"ZocDoc","permalink":"zocdoc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0000/0250/250v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/0250/250v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,44],"assets/images/resized/0000/0250/250v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Engagement Manager","firm":{"name":"McKinsey & Company","permalink":"mckinsey-company","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/2040/22040v1-max-150x150.png"],[[209,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/2040/22040v1-max-250x250.png"],[[209,38],"assets/images/resized/0002/2040/22040v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
