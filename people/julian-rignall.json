Since then he has cut his hair and gone on to create some of the most influential and best-regarded gaming magazines and websites in the world, including Mean Machines, Computer and Videogames, and the Official Nintendo Magazines in the UK, and IGN.com, Nvision and World of Warcraft: Official Magazine in the states.</p>\n\n<p>While he is best known for his contributions to gaming journalism, Julian has also spent time working with some of the biggest corporations in America, including tours of duty running the web content creation teams at both BankofAmerica.com and Wal-Mart.com, and also creating national ad campaigns, catalogs and marketing materials for Dell, Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently, he spent three years at Future Plus, the custom publishing division of Future US, where he created highly successful content solutions for Fortune 500 companies such as Best Buy, K-Mart, Apple, Blizzard-Activision, Toys R Us and Research in Motion/BlackBerry.</p>\n\n<p>When not writing for magazines and websites, Julian can be found DJ-ing, competitively playing World of Warcraft, and finding new sinewy Northern Californian backroads to challenge his motorcycle riding skills.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"vice president of content","firm":{"name":"GamePro Media","permalink":"gamepro-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,24],"assets/images/resized/0011/7035/117035v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,40],"assets/images/resized/0011/7035/117035v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[332,54],"assets/images/resized/0011/7035/117035v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
