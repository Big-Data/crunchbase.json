In fact, his seminal Ph.D. research on light field technology earned the fieldâ€™s top honor, the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award for best thesis in computer science and engineering, as well as Stanford Universityâ€™s Arthur Samuel Award for Best Ph.D. Dissertation. The entrepreneurial spark came when Ren purchased his first DSLR camera and saw the potential to apply light field technology to capture pictures in addition to image generation. As a result, instead of continuing on a purely academic path, Ren decided to apply and extend his theoretical work by making light field cameras that everyone can use. Thatâ€™s how the Lytro picture revolution began.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/7789/147789v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[156,218],"assets/images/resized/0014/7789/147789v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[156,218],"assets/images/resized/0014/7789/147789v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"computational science","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Lytro","permalink":"lytro","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0014/4938/144938v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[177,72],"assets/images/resized/0014/4938/144938v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[177,72],"assets/images/resized/0014/4938/144938v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
