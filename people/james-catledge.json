Raised by a single mother, James worked odd jobs to afford good clothes and any extras. James paid his own way through college and his two-year LDS mission. Jamesâ€™s mother, Janie, made certain he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest honor in scouting. Janie said, â€œNo Eagle means no driverâ€™s license,â€ and that was all he needed to know. When James was a young man, his mother also gave him great advice. She told him it was more important to be focused and to dream big rather than just to dream. She promised if he did that, he could accomplish anything. After graduation from high school, James moved west to attend college. At age 19 he was called to serve a mission for his church. As a missionary he found his passion in serving others. Working in northern California he was able to serve hundreds. Later he enrolled at Brigham Young University where he studied Business and Communications. James has been married to his lovely wife Tiffany for 15 years. He is also an avid golfer and is a current USGA member and maintains an active golf index.</p>\n\n<p>Business - James knew when he started his career that he wanted to accomplish big things. He has always had a desire to make a difference. Joining a large financial services group, he realized immediately that he had found a vehicle to accomplish this goal. He was coached and mentored well, and he learned every aspect of financial services. By the age of 29, he had become the principal &#8220;Communicator&#8221; for the company. By 35 James had built a team that included several thousand agents across America. He was now sharing his passion and mastery of financial services with other leaders as well as his unique talent for business building. James identified the need to bring unbiased advice to families and proceeded to launch his own company. The focus would be to teach people about money and to help families be more responsible for their own net worth. Now thousands of associates and tens of thousands of clients have been taught these principles. Today James is a business entrepreneur still dedicated to making a difference.</p>\n\n<p>As a powerful public speaker, James receives numerous requests to speak about success principles at universities and corporate events.</p>\n\n<p>Family - James and his wife, Tiffany, have 6 children and have centered their lives around their beautiful family. In 2006 James and Tiffany were blessed with identical twins. They consider the work they do within their home to be the most important work they will accomplish.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,90],"assets/images/resized/0008/3518/83518v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,151],"assets/images/resized/0008/3518/83518v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,272],"assets/images/resized/0008/3518/83518v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>James with Former President Bush</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
