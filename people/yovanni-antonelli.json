What are the mechanisms in which we can cultivate this mindfulness leading to reduced cognitive error, corrected maladaptive psychological processes, and flourishing well-being for non-clinical populations is in sum the focal area of Yovanni Antonelli&#8217;s research. She employs sophisticated empirical, systematic methodology to gain insight into this domain - more than often leading to counterintuitive findings.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Yovanni has been working specifically on identifying the correlates of a rewarding life. The 3C or &#8220;cookie&#8221; model includes challenge, social connectedness, and choice (control) as fundamental components towards fulfilling universalizable human motivation.
