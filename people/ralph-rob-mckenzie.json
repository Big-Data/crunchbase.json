They personally feel this will help the indie Artist spread the word about their Music quickly and get the exposure they deserve especially for un-signed Artist looking to get signed to a Major Record Deal.</p>\n\n<p>In June of 2011, Hype Music Mix will launch â€œHype Music Mix Radioâ€ where they will conduct one on one interviews with Indie Artist, give single CD reviews and provide information to their Artist Members on how to get their music heard.</p>\n\n<p>Hype Music Mix â€œPromoting Indie Music Worldwide is what they do bestâ€!</p>\n\n<p>So start spreading the word about Hype Music Mix</p>\n\n<p>Join for FREE at http://hypemusicmix.com/</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/5704/135704v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/5704/135704v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0013/5704/135704v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Music Social Network</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
