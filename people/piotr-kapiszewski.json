At the end of 1997 Piotr moved to Freddie Mac, helping the company to develop and deploy a company-wide storage\ntechnology, and later deployed a similar storage solution at IBM&#8217;s Netfinity server build lab in RTP. In 1999 Piotr built various automation tools to facilitate system level deployment at NASD.</p>\n\n<p>Piotr next moved to Road Runner (a Time Warner Cable company), helping to expand its internet presence in the emerging online cable market. He worked on the physical and technical buildout of the datacenter that would power Road Runner&#8217;s internet portal, and contributed to the installation of the server farm that ran www.rr.com for company cable customers as well as the internet audience.</p>\n\n<p>In mid-2000 Piotr moved to California. Here he joined Neoforma (a healthcare supply chain management company) to lead its internet data center team. His team provided direction and implementation to various corporate projects including the design of an EDI processing system\nallowing customizable B2B connections with hundreds of trading partners participating in the market place. He then jumped to a home lending application software company (Dorado), running its data center operations group from 2001-2002.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, Piotr switched to running his own company, 3D Gamers, an internet gaming news and digital download portal. While Piotr had begun to build the company in 1996, between 2002 and 2005 it experienced spectacular growth, eventually reaching a monthly audience of over 2\nmillion unique visitors. In early 2005 Piotr sold 3D Gamers to IGN Entertainment (Fox Interactive Media, News Corp), continuing to run it for the buyer through early 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout 2007 Piotr helped NaturalPath Media, a startup in the green and healthy living space, to grow its portal (Naturalpath) and to create an ad representation business (GreenAdWorks). Leveraging his experience in the entertainment industry, Piotr helped to develop a strategy to\ncreate an advertising network and to pitch the idea to venture capitalists. He also played a key role in designing the first generation of the advertising platform deployed to both publishers and\nadvertisers who joined the network.</p>\n\n<p>Piotr lives in Orange County, CA. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Infrastructure","firm":{"name":"Sleepy Giant","permalink":"sleepy-giant","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,35],"assets/images/resized/0017/0293/170293v2-max-150x150.png"],[[193,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/0293/170293v2-max-250x250.png"],[[193,46],"assets/images/resized/0017/0293/170293v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"3D Gamers","permalink":"3d-gamers","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"NaturalPath Media","permalink":"naturalpath-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0004/1154/41154v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/1154/41154v1-max-250x250.png"],[[277,54],"assets/images/resized/0004/1154/41154v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Operations","firm":{"name":"Javaground","permalink":"javaground","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0003/8029/38029v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/8029/38029v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/8029/38029v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"IGN Entertainment","permalink":"ignentertainment","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/7173/27173v5-max-150x150.png"],[[144,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/7173/27173v5-max-250x250.png"],[[144,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/7173/27173v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/pkapiszewski","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
