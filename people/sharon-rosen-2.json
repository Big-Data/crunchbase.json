Another email was sent with final arrangements information and one more with location, days, and times for sitting shiva. She found the internet to be the most efficient and comfortable way to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>Stress grew as the phone kept ringing with questions about food. Friends continued to call asking what was needed, when to send it and people from out of town called not knowing where to order from. An abundance of food was delivered, platters were taken back to delicatessens for overnight refrigeration and others were donated to a local shelter. </p>\n\n<p>Exhausted and overwhelmed by this experience, Sharon conceived the idea of an all- inclusive online resource to conveniently provide information, assistance and coordination of the bereavement period &#8230;ShivaConnect.com.</p>\n\n<p>It  features informative articles, an online Shiva Registry to conveniently share as well as coordinate funeral &amp; shiva details, and many other services that are helpful at a time of loss.</p>\n\n<p>After more than a year of intricate programming and design, a mourner, relative or caring friend can now easily enter pertinent information on a private Shiva Registry page.  Much more than an online Jewish obituary,  it includes funeral and shiva dates, times, places, interactive directions, mournersâ€™ contact information, food notes, synagogue affiliations, family charitable requests, eulogies and who to call if you have a question.  A direct link to the personal Shiva Registry page can then be emailed, texted, tweeted,  posted on Facebook or found through a search on ShivaConnectâ€™s  home page. </p>\n\n<p>With â€œjust a click,â€ family and friends learn sitting shiva details, find local delis and send shiva platters, view and post food already sent, make charitable donations, find helpful resources, read eulogies and send thoughtful messages to mourners. Each Shiva Registry is typically viewed by more than 100 visitors, making it convenient for them to express their condolences. Mourning families appreciate using a Shiva Registry to minimize stress, unnecessary phone calls, confusion and wasted food.</p>\n\n<p>Shiva Connect.com has educational articles that are of interest to Jews and non-Jews about customs, traditions and preparing  your home for sitting shiva, visiting the shiva house, Jewish prayers, poems,  kaddish, etc. Another unique feature is the â€œYahrzeit Reminderâ€ which is emailed each year to subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>Jewish charitable organizations, Synagogues, Jewish Funeral Homes and Hospices are welcomed to complimentary listings, a direct charity link to facilitate memorial donations, shiva information cards and access to the Shiva Registry system.   ShivaConnect.com has begun to list a wide range of helpful resources available throughout the United States, such as bereavement groups, senior living facilities, nursing homes, geriatric care services, realtors, movers, consignment shops, legal assistance, financial and insurance consultants, jewelry appraisal, pre-need planning, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Sharonâ€™s vision of creating a comprehensive website to help others is now a reality.ShivaConnect.com is a tribute to her Mother, who always gave love and support to family and friends.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[142,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/8039/138039v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[231,243],"assets/images/resized/0013/8039/138039v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[231,243],"assets/images/resized/0013/8039/138039v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>SharonRosen/<a href=\"http://www.shivaconnect.com\" title=\"ShivaConnect\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShivaConnect</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Education","institution":"Queens College","graduated_year":1970,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Shiva Connect, Inc.","permalink":"shiva-connect-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.shivaconnect.com/page/what-is-shivaconnect/","title":"What is ShivaConnect?"},{"external_url":"http://www.shivaconnect.com/page/how-it-started/","title":"How ShivaConnect Started"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/shivaconnect","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/shivaconnect1","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.shivaconnect.com/page/contact-us/","title":"ShivaConnect Contact Us"}]}
