He opened a web company in college that helped him pay for school while developing an RFID hardware system for the Department of Homeland Security (before RFID was cool). For his work with Homeland Security, he won the coveted senior design award from Purdue&#8217;s College of Technology.</p>\n\n<p>After graduation, Jonathan moved to Los Angeles, CA to become a product manager at MySpace where he worked directly with founder Tom Anderson. He quickly became Tom&#8217;s &#8216;go-to&#8217; guy for fixing and innovating on MySpace&#8217;s most critical products; including the homepage and profile.</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan left MySpace in early 2008 to build a startup for high school athletes called <a href=\"http://www.firststring.com\" title=\"FirstString\" rel=\"nofollow\">FirstString</a>. Following FirstString, he was recruited by eHarmony to lead a complete site redesign.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2012, he launched <a href=\"http://thelittleblackbookapp.com\" title=\"The Little Black Book\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Little Black Book</a>, which he designed, a friend developed and they launched for iPhone in just five weeks. Just a month after launching they put out an <a href=\"http://thelittleblackbookapp.com/the-hookup-statistics\" title=\"Infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infographic</a> illustrating the sexual behaviors of the apps users which received numerous attention in the press.</p>\n\n<p>In the summer of 2012, Jonathan founded <a href=\"http://onradpad.com\" title=\"RadPad\" rel=\"nofollow\">RadPad</a>, an iPhone app for renters and listers. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/1483/71483v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/1483/71483v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/1483/71483v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jonathan Eppers</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Computer Graphics Technology","institution":"Purdue University","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"RadPad","permalink":"radpad","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/7175/197175v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0019/7175/197175v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0019/7175/197175v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / Product","firm":{"name":"FirstString","permalink":"firststring","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,82],"assets/images/resized/0001/8163/18163v14-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0001/8163/18163v14-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,246],"assets/images/resized/0001/8163/18163v14-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / Product","firm":{"name":"The Little Black Book","permalink":"the-little-black-book","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/3354/183354v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/3354/183354v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/3354/183354v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Product Manager","firm":{"name":"eHarmony","permalink":"eharmony","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-150x150.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-250x250.png"],[[200,48],"assets/images/resized/0000/4480/4480v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Product Manager","firm":{"name":"MySpace","permalink":"myspace","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0000/4414/4414v80-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.sociableblog.com/2009/02/11/interview-with-jonathan-eppers-ceo-of-firststring/","title":"Interview with Jonathan Eppers, CEO of FirstString.com"},{"external_url":"http://startupmeme.com/firststring-a-home-on-the-web-for-high-school-athletes/","title":"FirstString: A home on the Web for high school athletes"},{"external_url":"http://www.adotas.com/2009/02/firststring-teen-sport-social-network/","title":"FirstString Teen Sport Social Network"},{"external_url":"http://www.kernelmag.com/editors-blog/1620/lies-damned-lies-and-fucking-statistics/","title":"At supper in West Hollywood"},{"external_url":"http://blogs.laweekly.com/afterdark/2012/03/hook-up_sex_iphone_app.php","title":"Little Black Book Hook-up App Reveals Unexpected International Sex Trends"},{"external_url":"http://techzulu.com/your-little-black-book-mobile-app/","title":"Your Little Black Book Mobile App"},{"external_url":"http://consumingpr.com/2012/03/21/app-spotlight-the-little-black-book/","title":"App Spotlight: The Little Black Book"},{"external_url":"http://thejoeyparkermovement.com/post/21301269850/joey-parker-sits-down-with-entrepreneur-jonathan-eppers","title":"Joey Parker Sits Down With Emerging Entrepreneur Jonathan Eppers!"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/jonathaneppers","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathaneppers","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/jonathaneppers","title":"Facebook"}]}
