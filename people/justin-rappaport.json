He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Michigan State University in Telecommunications, Information Studies, and Media. His primary involvement within the company is oversight in product development, and information technology management.</p>\n\n<p>Justin knew he had an affinity for information technology at an early stage in life. At nine years old, he began coding and custom-rolling software and data applications that interacted with early internet service providers and internet platforms. After pushing the limits of what early mainstream internet experiences had to offer, his efforts turned commercial and he started a web development and design firm. Managing client relationships, product development, working with designers, and running the day-to-day operations of the business helped him to forge new pathways in the business and continue growing his skill-set.</p>\n\n<p>While attending Michigan State University, those skills continued to grow and helped attain employment at the College of Education. In the past year Justin has been working with the SocialTab team to develop cutting edge products in social media and niche content arenas. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/9542/139542v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/9542/139542v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0013/9542/139542v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Justin Rappaport / <a href=\"http://www.socialtab.com\" title=\"SocialTab Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow\">SocialTab Inc.</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"Telecommunications, Information Studies, and Media","institution":"Michigan State University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Information Officer","firm":{"name":"SocialTab","permalink":"socialtab","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0006/1844/61844v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0006/1844/61844v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,155],"assets/images/resized/0006/1844/61844v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.socialtab.com","title":"SocialTab Inc."},{"external_url":"http://www.stuforest.com","title":"Stuforest"}],"web_presences":[]}
