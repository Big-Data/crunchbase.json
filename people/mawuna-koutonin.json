I became obsessively passionate about the Internet, and created with friends one of the first Togo news portal on the Internet in 1995. </p>\n\n<p>In 1993, when I was forced to walk 30km a day to go to school, I discovered a formula that completely changed my life. (The full story is here: http://bit.ly/ez7kPS). </p>\n\n<p>Unstoppable, my passion for the Internet coupled with the life success formula Iâ€™ve discovered, gave birth to my startup product: The Goodbuzz Network. </p>\n\n<p>Goodbuzz is a place where everyone can post his events and activities promotions, and taps into a free peer referral network to virally spread his message to buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Members recommend each other events for free using different channels available: emailing, social medias (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Myspace, etc.), blog, posters, flyers, sms, etc.</p>\n\n<p>When things work out well, itâ€™s like getting the Super Bowl spotlight on your business for free.</p>\n\n<p>The value of the program is that it makes it easier for people to ask and receive help to promote their events.</p>\n\n<p>Goodbuzz.org is young and small, but it has a good potential.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/1619/131619v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/1619/131619v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0013/1619/131619v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Linkcrafter","permalink":"linkcrafter","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/linkcrafter","title":"Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/4goodbuzz","title":"Twitter"}]}
