Before Hatch, he helped build Flurry, a venture-backed smartphone application analytics and monetization platform, where he was an early employee and led efforts in business development, marketing, and product support. Prior to this, Azeem was an investment banker at Houlihan Lokey, where he covered M&amp;A and advisory engagements primarily in the tech, media, and telecom sectors. </p>\n\n<p>Azeem has a Kindle and most of his books are about: software design, history, and health/nutrition. He played the guitar for a decade but stopped 5 years ago, so he’s picked it back up; you’ll find him strumming a tune every now and again along with a keyboard he just bought on Craigslist. He loves New York and Philadelphia. </p>\n\n<p>Azeem holds a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania with minors in Physics and Computer Science.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Product","firm":{"name":"Hatch Labs","permalink":"hatch-labs","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0017/9991/179991v1-max-150x150.png"],[[210,43],"assets/images/resized/0017/9991/179991v1-max-250x250.png"],[[210,43],"assets/images/resized/0017/9991/179991v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Early Employee","firm":{"name":"Pinch Media","permalink":"pinch-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0001/9614/19614v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0001/9614/19614v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0001/9614/19614v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
