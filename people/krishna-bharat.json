This service can automatically index about 4500 news websites around the world and provide a summary of the News resources. Officially his title is &#8220;Principal Research Scientist.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Krishna Bharat created Google News in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks to keep him abreast of the developments. Since then, it has been a huge hit and a popular offering from Google&#8217;s services. It is interesting to note that Google News was one of Google&#8217;s first endeavors beyond offering just plain text searches on its page.</p>\n\n<p>Krishna was born in India, and grew up in Bangalore, then a sleepy town in South India. He completed his schooling from St. Joseph&#8217;s Boys&#8217; High School in Bangalore, and received an undergraduate degree in computer science from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. He subsequently received a Ph.D from Georgia Tech in Human Computer Interaction. His work on the Hilltop algorithm earned him a joint patent with Google.
