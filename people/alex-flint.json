In 2008 Alex was awarded a scholarship from the Clarendon Fund in order to undertake his DPhil. This scholarship is awarded for overall academic merit and accepts less than 7% of applicants. Alex completed his undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Adelaide, from which he has subsequently received a University Medal for outstanding academic achievement. After graduating in 2007 he worked for Google for six months before beginning his DPhil at Oxford. In 2010 he founded the Oxford Transhumanist society to promote discussion and debate on issues around rationality, ethics, and technology. He also has been a member of the student committee for the Oxford Entrepreneurs and has helped found the Clarendon Scholars Council. He has also worked voluntarily for the Oxford Hub, where in 2009 he founded the Media Team to film short documentaries on student issues in Oxford.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[139,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1195/141195v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[232,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/1195/141195v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,323],"assets/images/resized/0014/1195/141195v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Oxford Ideas","permalink":"oxford-ideas","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[117,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1198/141198v2-max-150x150.png"],[[147,188],"assets/images/resized/0014/1198/141198v2-max-250x250.png"],[[147,188],"assets/images/resized/0014/1198/141198v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
