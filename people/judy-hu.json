As GE&#8217;s Global Executive Director, Advertising and Branding, Judy Hu has taken a complex array of technologies and forged a simplified global message for GE that can be seen in groundbreaking advertising, Olympic marketing, and the launch of GE&#8217;s newest business initiatives. </p>\n\n<p>That requisite imagination literally leapt onto the page and online in 2003 when Judy launched the now-familiar global campaign, &#8220;Imagination at Work,&#8221; introducing a new vision for GE while simultaneously integrating the company&#8217;s vast R&amp;D investments, high-tech products and solutions and services businesses. The campaign has won over 100 awards globally, including Gold and Silver Effies, Silver and Bronze Cyber Lions at Cannes, National Gold Addys, and NY Ad Week&#8217;s &#8220;America&#8217;s Favorite Ad Slogan&#8221; contest.  </p>\n\n<p>Building on that success, Judy launched GE&#8217;s &#8220;ecomagination&#8221; campaign, which encompasses all of GE&#8217;s energy efficient technologies, and positioned GE as a leader in environmental issues.  This was followed by &#8220;healthymagination,&#8221; which focuses on bringing better health to more people through improving access and quality and reducing costs. </p>\n\n<p>Between her GE experience and five years at General Motors, Judy knows how to make a splash when the world is watching as seen in GE&#8217;s Olympic sponsorship &#8211; where her work ranges from sales incentive programs used in 40 countries to mobile programs in China to an award-winning interactive GE showcase that was built on the Beijing Olympic Green.</p>\n\n<p>With a Harvard degree and an MBA from Yale, Judy began her career editing and designing trade books before moving into advertising at Leo Burnett in Hong Kong and DMB&amp;B, where she rose to Senior Vice President. A member of the Board of Directors of the Ad Council and the Association of National Advertisers, some of Judy&#8217;s most recent recognitions include the &#8220;Gertrude Crain&#8221; award from American Business Media in 2009 and the Advertising Women of New York &#8220;Changing the Game&#8221; award in 2008. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/7216/87216v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,209],"assets/images/resized/0008/7216/87216v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,209],"assets/images/resized/0008/7216/87216v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Global executive Director, Advertising and Branding","firm":{"name":"General Electric","permalink":"general-electric","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
