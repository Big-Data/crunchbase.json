With her entirely real, come-as-you-are-attitude, a heartfelt lyrical voice, and an undeniably positive spirit, Ketsia is proving that you donâ€™t have to be industry-contrived to make great pop music thatâ€™s heard and appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>With a rapidly increasing online presence, radio air play on Virgin 96 Montreal, Mix 103.7 Alberta, Hot 89.9 Ottawa, and Flow 93.5 Toronto, and sales of her single â€œQuand Je Tâ€™ai RencontrÃ©â€ on the verge of national Gold download status, Ketsia serves as a shining example of how independent artists with talent, distinct voices and perseverance can cut through the clutter of cookie-cutter music to reach fans worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>Like Montreal, the city in which she was born and raised, Ketsiaâ€™s unique style draws on several cultural and musical influences: her Haitian heritage, her background as a child choral singer, and her singing and songwriting work in variety of genres (R&amp;B, Pop, Hip-Hop, and Dance). All these are molded into a dance musical style that speaks to her personality (in both English and French): fun and infectious, at times bold, at times reflective, and always from the heart.</p>\n\n<p>Her recently released debut album, â€œUne Reine Est NÃ©eâ€, showcases her wide musical background, from the undeniably rocky pulse of â€œLet It Goâ€ to the dance grooving â€œDown Pour Toiâ€. The album features an impressive list of contributions from Canadian talent including Vancouverâ€™s Ryan Stewart (Carly Rae Jepsen, Canadian Idol) and Russell Klyne (Nelly Furtado, K-OS), as well as MontrÃ©alâ€™s own Joe Barrucco (MC Mario, Samantha Fox, 3 JUNO-nominated tracks). </p>\n\n<p>Unlike many Pop artists, Ketsia doesnâ€™t water down the integrity of her music. Nowhere is this more clear than in her live show, where she brings Barruccoâ€™s production to life through a rocking and grooving set, backed by the power of live guitars, basses, drums and a mother lode of funky keyboards and samplers. Ketsia is a proverbial â€œshow-stopperâ€ who genuinely loves performing, giving off a contagious enjoyment of being onstage, playing the music she loves. Watch for her to light up the stage this summer in hot spots across Canada!</p>\n\n<p>While just getting started in her solo career, Ketsia has already grown a network of thousands of loyal fans and supporters online, and the numbers keep growing. Listen to her music online at www.ketsiamusic.com or www.myspace.com/ketsiamusic, and join the many thousands of supporters who have already become a member of Ketsiaâ€™s Facebook fan page. Ketsia can also be found on iLike, iTunes, Puretracks, and YouTube, where her music video â€œLet It Go (Remix)â€ has been viewed over 100,000 times. </p>\n\n<p>If you havenâ€™t already, be sure to check out Ketsiaâ€™s new hit single â€œPossible.â€ Released in May 2010, â€œPossibleâ€ is generating tons of excitement online and in the media.
