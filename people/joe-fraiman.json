Over the last 15 years he&#8217;s lived in countless apartments across the country — and he obsessively designed each one. Along the way he hiked 1000 miles on the Appalachian Trail, crossed Asia on the Trans-Siberian Railway, and climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. Joe has worked in construction in Alaska, developed top-secret defense software in San Diego, and raised money for the world’s largest hedge fund in Connecticut. He studied computer science and philosophy at Dartmouth College and NYU. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/6061/206061v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/6061/206061v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,400],"assets/images/resized/0020/6061/206061v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joe-fraiman/20/28a/756\" title=\"Joe Fraiman on LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe Fraiman on LinkedIn</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Computer Science with Philosophy Minor","institution":"New York University","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Dartmouth College","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Tastemaker","permalink":"tastemaker","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0020/6059/206059v1-max-150x150.png"],[[197,38],"assets/images/resized/0020/6059/206059v1-max-250x250.png"],[[197,38],"assets/images/resized/0020/6059/206059v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Engineer, Process Engineer","firm":{"name":"Raytheon","permalink":"raytheon","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/1829/51829v1-max-150x150.png"],[[149,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/1829/51829v1-max-250x250.png"],[[149,28],"assets/images/resized/0005/1829/51829v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Head of Investment Consultant Relations, Software Engineering Manager","firm":{"name":"Bridgewater Associates","permalink":"bridgewater-associates","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,76],"assets/images/resized/0020/2159/202159v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[162,83],"assets/images/resized/0020/2159/202159v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[162,83],"assets/images/resized/0020/2159/202159v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joe-fraiman/20/28a/756","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
