GoDaddy.com is larger than its six closest competitors combined. </p>\n\n<p>The road to multi-million dollar success began in Baltimore where, by his own account, Bob barely graduated from high school. After a stint in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, he enrolled at the University of Baltimore where he earned his CPA degree.</p>\n\n<p>Bob spent the next decade building his first company â€“ an Iowa-based software firm named Parsons Technology â€“ into a company he would eventually sell to IntuitÂ® for $64 million.</p>\n\n<p>The entrepreneur, who describes himself as &#8220;someone who needs to be on the firing line,&#8221; started Go Daddy three years later.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the busy CEO manages his Web empire from a 57-inch computer monitor that hangs from the ceiling of his office in Scottsdale, AZ. The screen not only shows his companyâ€™s market share at any given moment, but also displays each domain name as itâ€™s registered at GoDaddy.com.</p>\n\n<p>An avid motorcyclist, Bob has logged 85,000 miles on his 12 motorcycles over the past few years. He also owns a multi-franchise motorcycle store that includes BMWÂ®, Ducati, KTMÂ® and TriumphÂ® dealerships as well as a HondaÂ® shop in Scottsdale. The dealership can be found online at www.GOAZ.com.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Served as a combat rifleman in the 26th Marines during Vietnam and was awarded a Combat Action Ribbon, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry and a Purple Heart.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, the University of Baltimore, and named its â€œdistinguished entrepreneurâ€ in April 2010.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0009/9491/99491v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,231],"assets/images/resized/0009/9491/99491v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,416],"assets/images/resized/0009/9491/99491v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>GoDaddy.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Chairman & Founder","firm":{"name":"GoDaddy.com","permalink":"godaddy","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/2280/22280v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/2280/22280v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0002/2280/22280v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://bobparsons.me","title":"Homepage & Video Blog"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/drbobparsons","title":"@DrBobParsons on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/DrBobParsons","title":"Facebook Fan Page"},{"external_url":"http://www.bobparsons.me/bp_16_rules.php","title":"Bob's 16 Rules"}]}
