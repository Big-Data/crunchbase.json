She has written previously in the newsrooms of the Vancouver Business Journal and North Bank magazine in Washington State, and the Lewiston Tribune  in Idaho. Charity co-authored the Spanish-English stageplay, &#8220;Strangers/Extranjeras,&#8221; with Jennifer Thalman Kepler and Looking for Lilith Theatre Company of Louisville, KY. She&#8217;s studying with Portland State University&#8217;s Graduate School of Education and has a Bachelor of Arts in English from Lewis-Clark State College in Idaho. And because she loves laughing almost more than writing, Charity has read with Mortified Portland, and blogs about all of the the weird situations she walks into at snapshotstory.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[52,62],"assets/images/resized/0010/5279/105279v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[52,62],"assets/images/resized/0010/5279/105279v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[52,62],"assets/images/resized/0010/5279/105279v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"English","institution":"Lewis-Clark State College in Idaho","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Contributor","firm":{"name":"Neighborhood Notes","permalink":"neighborhood-notes","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/4775/104775v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.neighborhoodnotes.com/author/Charity/","title":"Neighborhood Notes Blog"}]}
