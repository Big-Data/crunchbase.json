Answers emerged.</p>\n\n<p>Atanas professional experience includes business consultancy at the French VC-funded IKALEO project (telecom) and managerial position at Bluvizia, an affiliate company of Icygen, where he was responsible for the companyâ€™s operations on the French speaking markets and for the launch of the Bluevizia global e-commerce platform.</p>\n\n<p>People still remember 2 years ago as he declared loudly â€“ there is something broken in this web! What is the point of creating content at one place, consume it on another and interact on it elsewhere. As a result now people have a single place to do all possible things with the content of their interests - favit. </p>\n\n<p>Always full of energy and optimism, he lives at work, starting every morning at 6 am. He copes with great hardships, thousands of comparisons and searching to offer the most user-friendly solution.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[130,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/3784/73784v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[217,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/3784/73784v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[391,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/3784/73784v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master","subject":"Management","institution":"UniversitÃ© Montesquieu","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Business Administration","institution":"Sofia University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Head of Product Design","firm":{"name":"favit Network","permalink":"favit-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0007/3184/73184v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/3184/73184v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,134],"assets/images/resized/0007/3184/73184v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://bg.linkedin.com/pub/atanas-youroukov/4/3a1/131","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
