Shortly thereafter they discovered a major pain point: an inability to check local stock and prices in real-time from the web. In the fall of 2008 he raised an angel round with prominent angels Keith Rabois, Kevin Hartz and Jawed Karim which closed after the worst week in stock market history in fall 2008. In the following year Milo added 50,000 retail locations across the US and attracted over 1 million unique monthly visitors without marketing. In the fall of 2009, during the heart of the recession, the company closed an A round led by True Ventures and prominent angels including Ron Conway, Aydin Senkut, Jeff Clavier, Shervin Pishevar, Aaron Patzer, Chris Dixon and Russ Fradin among others. Shortly thereafter the company, then a strongly technical team of 26, was in a courting period for partnerships/acquisitions and eventually was bought by eBay.</p>\n\n<p>Jack also angel invests and has was the first investor in Invite Media (acq. Google) and Ampush Media. He also was a seed investor in Pinterest among other startups. He has been named in Business Weekâ€™s Top 25 Under 25, Incâ€™s 30 Under 30 and Fast Companyâ€™s 100 most creative people in business.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0004/2699/42699v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,169],"assets/images/resized/0004/2699/42699v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,228],"assets/images/resized/0004/2699/42699v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSE","subject":"Technological
