He is carefully crafting all global branding for Portalarium and its products as he has done for several top game studios/publishers in the past as an exec with NCsoft, ORIGIN / Electronic Arts and MicroProse Software back in the day, plus many other entertainment companies in the fields of radio, television, cable television, print, music and retail.</p>\n\n<p>As a restless gamer, Fred plays &#8220;hundreds of different games a little bit,&#8221; trying to stay on top of the market and trends, and to kill time he doesn&#8217;t have. He lives in Downtown Austin where he never sleeps because he is actively engaged in community affairs and busy bicycling, kayaking and absorbing loads of the rich local music scene. A political refugee from Poland as a kid, Fred is the least technically proficient member of the team but the only one with a college degree; the rest of the guys try not to hold that against him.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[146,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/4943/144943v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[244,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/4943/144943v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[440,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/4943/144943v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, President & CEO","firm":{"name":"Portalarium","permalink":"portalarium","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0013/7301/137301v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0013/7301/137301v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[321,69],"assets/images/resized/0013/7301/137301v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
