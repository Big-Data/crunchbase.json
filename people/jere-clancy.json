I am the child of two CPA&#8217;s and we were not allowed to go home after school from January until May. Instead we had to go to their office and study or somehow entertain ourselves at a Kentucky CPA Firm. Tax Code is only so fun. My parents could only trick us into &#8220;let&#8217;s put the checks in order&#8221; game so many times.</p>\n\n<p>The work wasn&#8217;t that bad. We were paid $5 an hour when we worked and that went a long way in the 70&#8217;s. At age 10, I was working on Digital Equipment&#8217;s giant accounting machine which was the size of a refrigerator and less powerful than my cell phone is now. I was working on AP and Payroll. Then the greatest thing happened. The PC arrived and with it Compuserve followed by AOL sucking endless amounts of idle time. Sometime later a browser came out but I missed that until college because I was an athlete and was not indoors again until college.</p>\n\n<p>My dad had every business magazine which you could subscribe. At 7, I was reading Fortune, Businessweek, Forbes and all kinds of crazy trade journals such as Realtor, Journal of Accountancy, Contractor, Hotel Business, etc. From an early age, I was curious as to why some people at work were happy and made lots of money and others were always fighting and complaining about co-workers who made more money and did half their job. Ever since, I continually challenge the notion of &#8220;because that&#8217;s how we have always done it&#8221;. There is ALWAYS a different way, you only have to be open to it. </p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine, listening to the dinner conversations in our home was like having 25 years of experience under my belt before I ever started my first job. In fact, at my first job, I was expected to know Lotus 123 but I did not. I had to learn it on the fly. Ever since, I vowed keep current with technology. Moreover, I have been a champion and early adopter of technology in the fields of accounting, finance, FP&amp;A, etc. by automating manual processes whenever possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/5313/175313v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[160,240],"assets/images/resized/0017/5313/175313v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[160,240],"assets/images/resized/0017/5313/175313v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Jere W Clancy</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BBA","subject":"Finance","institution":"University of Kentucky","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, Finance & Accunting","firm":{"name":"Wonderverse Inc.","permalink":"wonderverse-inc-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0017/5825/175825v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,31],"assets/images/resized/0017/5825/175825v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,56],"assets/images/resized/0017/5825/175825v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://angel.co/jereclancy","title":"Angel List"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/jereclancy","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jereclancy","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/jereclancy","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/101111942214759008383/posts","title":"Google+"}]}
