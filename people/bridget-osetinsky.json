It was founded to make the knowledge in big data transparent. She was qualified to do it because she both understood the extreme gravity of the problem and, unique within that group, had the ability to fix it. She filed her first patent at nineteen for a laser that converges to a variable focal depth. She studied physics at the University of Notre Dame followed by law at Temple&#8217;s Beasley School of Law. She went to law school because she hopes to become a judge (around sixty). She invented this technology the summer after her first year. Second year she entered many competitions and the summer after second year worked at a private equity firm. Third year she conducted international interviewing to find her co-founder and wonderful partner, Dr. Abdul Aziz and spent this past year building the prototype for the Big Data research tool. She has three younger, strong-willed, kind, intelligent sisters, was raised mostly in Seattle, WA and loves salmon. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,137],"assets/images/resized/0021/1090/211090v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,229],"assets/images/resized/0021/1090/211090v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,229],"assets/images/resized/0021/1090/211090v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Physics","institution":"University of Notre Dame","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Juris Doctor","subject":"Intellectual Property, Legal Theory","institution":"Temple Beasley School Of Law","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Hyperfine","permalink":"hyperfine","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bridget-osetinsky/16/866/19","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
