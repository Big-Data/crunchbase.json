To me it&#8217;s one of the best forms of human expression.  And at PoetryVisualized.com, we have taken it to the next level.  Not just with words, but combine it with music, sounds, images.<br/>\nPoetry is already a beautiful art form by itself - and when combined with music, photographs, videos, arts, graphics - the result is just awesome, the variety of expressions and creativity is just fantastic.\nWe believe that this form of poetic expression - which we refer to as a VPoem - short for Visualized Poem or Visualized Poetry - is the emerging genre of poetry in the 21st Century and beyond.  For you who love and appreciate poetry, and all the other related art forms that are integrated into Visualized Poetry, we&#8217;d like to invite you to share with us your creativity, and join us at PoetryVisualized.com.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing and PR","firm":{"name":"PoetryVisualized.com","permalink":"poetryvisualized-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/4151/24151v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/4151/24151v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,153],"assets/images/resized/0002/4151/24151v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
