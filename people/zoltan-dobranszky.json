The site concentrated only electronic music. TrancePort is now defunct. Besides this he started organizing electronic music events at the same year, and soon TrancePort became the number one trance party promoter company in Hungary. This way Zoltan had lots of connections in the music industry.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 he started to design the third version of TrancePort but soon realized that a redesign is not enough. In August of 2008 he was ready with the plans of a brand new social social network called Noise Freaks. He got two programmers and started the work in February of 2009. Due to Zoltan&#8217;s financial problems the project finished at 50% at the end of that year.</p>\n\n<p>One year passed by searching for funding, when Zoltan found Rudolf Major Gergely, former lead web developer of Ustream. Gergely liked the idea behind the project and started the work together. </p>\n\n<p>In October of 2010 Odor Zoltan joined with $10k seed funding. Odor is a marketing specialist at PWC.</p>\n\n<p>For June of 2011 they reached 60% and opened a splash page of Noise Freaks to the public.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[122,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/1154/141154v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[204,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/1154/141154v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[288,352],"assets/images/resized/0014/1154/141154v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder / CEO","firm":{"name":"Noise Freaks","permalink":"noise-freaks","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0014/1065/141065v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0014/1065/141065v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,245],"assets/images/resized/0014/1065/141065v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
