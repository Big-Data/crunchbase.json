Ever since I have been with shift planning; it has worked with me like an active business partner. Not only it has saved my time I used to spend on scheduling but also provided me with the adorable features which enable my staff to view their schedules, set availability, vacation requests and trade their shifts with whom they wish. It assures me of 100% amelioration and betterment by showing me the conflicts that occur from my end while scheduling. Either I cite my mangers, schedulers or employees all love ShiftPlanning immensely. I like the fact that these folks are giving round the clock support and it really won my recommendation for all kind of businesses and industries.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,33],"assets/images/resized/0009/1546/91546v2-max-150x150.png"],[[205,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/1546/91546v2-max-250x250.png"],[[205,46],"assets/images/resized/0009/1546/91546v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
