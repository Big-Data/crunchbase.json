He started his first design firm at the age of twelve, followed by several entertainment-focused social networks that competed with MySpace and introduced him to artists including Sister Hazel, The Gym Class Heroes, and MXPX. During high school, he neglected the things he was supposed to be studying in favor of indulging his curiosity. Over the course of four years, he read nearly four hundred books on everything from behavioral economics to french cooking, engineering, psychology, and art. </p>\n\n<p>Today, Patrick Widen is the founder of a service called EYES|ONLY that uses secrets to connect brands to people that will fall in love with them. He also runs a design consultancy called Blend that harnesses psychology, sociology, and behavioral economics to create products, services, and experiences that make people smile. To date, his touch can be seen in everything from iPhone apps to logos to products and experiences all over the world. </p>\n\n<p>Patrick&#8217;s adventures have landed him the world&#8217;s smallest cameo in Esquire, a position as one of the youngest guest lecturers in Vanderbilt&#8217;s history, and the beginning stages of two books he hopes to release as soon as they&#8217;re ready. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/2541/92541v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/2541/92541v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/2541/92541v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"EYES|ONLY","permalink":"eyes-only","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0014/9240/149240v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0014/9240/149240v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0014/9240/149240v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickwiden","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/patrickwiden","title":"Facebook"}]}
