Avado was founded on the premise that it will be virtually impossible to succeed in the new healthcare reimbursement models without recognizing that for 3/4 of healthcare spend (chronic disease), it&#8217;s the individual who controls decisions that drive outcomes. Avado gives the individual (aka &#8220;patient&#8221;) a seat at the care team table rather than being an afterthought as outlined in a TechCrunch piece entitled &#8220;Patients are More Than a Vessel for Billing Codes.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>During Dave&#8217;s time as an Accenture management consultant and leading Microsoft&#8217;s Health business, he reviewed or implemented over 100 healthIT systems at providers ranging from small rural settings to large, inner-city hospitals. Prior to co-founding Avado, Dave spent several years working in a variety of startups in acting executive/founder roles for market-leading digital media &amp; SaaS companies. During that time, Dave honed his digital marketing skills while developing low cost customer acquisition models. </p>\n\n<p>Dave&#8217;s entrepreneurial roots go back to building up a lawn mowing business in junior high to helping pay his way through college leading ski trips to Whistler. During college, Dave was a PAC-10 800 meter competitor. After college, he&#8217;s competed in multi-sport events including running, biking, Nordic skiing, Alpine skiing, canoeing and portages. Juggling multiple sports during multi-sport endurance events and the half sprint/marathon nature of the 800 are strikingly similar to the challenge of being a startup leader.</p>\n\n<p>You can follow him on Twitter @chasedave.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6969/86969v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/6969/86969v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0008/6969/86969v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Avado","permalink":"avado","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0013/2048/132048v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,86],"assets/images/resized/0013/2048/132048v7-max-250x250.png"],[[280,97],"assets/images/resized/0013/2048/132048v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Sr. Partner","firm":{"name":"Altus Alliance","permalink":"altus-alliance","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,18],"assets/images/resized/0004/2355/42355v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,30],"assets/images/resized/0004/2355/42355v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,55],"assets/images/resized/0004/2355/42355v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"https://profiles.google.com/chasedave","title":"Google Profile"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.avado.com","title":"Avado"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/chasedave","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
