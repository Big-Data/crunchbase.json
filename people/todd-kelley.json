Most recently he has led the software development for Axentra&#8217;s flagship product, the Net-Box Server Appliance, since the project began in early 2003. Before joining Axentra as Senior System Architect in the fall of 2000, Todd filled roles ranging from Systems Architect to Senior Designer at Nortel Networks. There he developed an award winning process effectiveness tool while working with the design, verification, and in-house tools groups to develop high-integrity process effectiveness metrics. Todd has long valued the relevance of Open Source Development, and was thrilled about the challenges and opportunities that joining the Axentra team offered him.</p>\n\n<p>Todd did his doctoral studies at the University of Toronto, where he was taught by one of the leading contributors to the field of Knowledge Representation, which comprises the theory and principles underlying the representation and computational manipulation of knowledge. There he developed a keen appreciation for the importance of mathematical rigor in computer science research. Among Todd&#8217;s contributions to the mathematical logic side of Knowledge Representation is the extending of the Situation Calculus to include functions as domain objects. He also holds a master&#8217;s degree in Artificial Intelligence and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science and physics, both from Queen&#8217;s University at Kingston.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","firm":{"name":"Axentra","permalink":"axentra","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/9450/19450v1-max-150x150.png"],[[209,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/9450/19450v1-max-250x250.png"],[[209,65],"assets/images/resized/0001/9450/19450v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"Axentra Corporation","permalink":"axentra-corporation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0004/9484/49484v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,48],"assets/images/resized/0004/9484/49484v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/9484/49484v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
