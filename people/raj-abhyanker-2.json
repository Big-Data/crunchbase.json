I enjoy building great new things, in diverse spaces. I have created a number of Internet websites including :</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Trademarkia.com (one of the largest legal websites on the Internet, attracting 3 million page views per month).  Trademarkia was a TechCrunch50 2009 Demo Pit company.     Trademarkia is a visual search engine for brands, logos, and government data.   It has grown to become one of the most successful companies in the legal information space, now driving nearly 3 million page views per month and on track to surpass more than $6 million dollars in revenue in 2011.    It has achieved this with no venture funding.</p></li>\n<li><p>TheDealMap/Fatdoor (acquired by Google Inc.), where I was CEO and co-founder, raising both the Series A and Series B venture financing, prior to the companyâ€™s acquisition by Google, Inc. in July 2011. </p></li>\n<li><p>AOLClassifieds (acquired by AOL, Inc.), and MacInsider (acquired by Ziff Davis, CNET). </p></li>\n<li><p>Instaroo, a new stealth-mode startup that hopes to make it&#8217;s launch at TechCrunch Disrupt 2012.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Prior to entering the legal profession, I worked at Lockheed Martin, Hewlett-Packard, and Juniper Networks (where I was the Director of Supply Chain).</p>\n\n<p>I hold a J.D., an M.B.A., and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University.
