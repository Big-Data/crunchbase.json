Previously, Biz helped build other popular social media services Xanga, Blogger, and Odeo. After launching the journalling service Xanga in 2000, Biz went on to publish two books about the origins and social significance of blogging.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Google invited Biz to join a recently acquired Blogger.com team at its Silicon Valley headquarters in a full-time, senior role. Biz helped relaunch the service and grow Blogger significantly worldwide. He left Google in 2005 to rejoin the startup world.</p>\n\n<p>Stone, 34, is a native of Boston, Massachusetts and teaches an annual master class at Oxford&#8217;s Sa√Ød Business School.
