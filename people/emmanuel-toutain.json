After receiving a definite no, Emmanuel felt compelled to find something else to show gratitude to the intern for his good work. He offered to serve as a reference. However, he knew that the chances that a prospective employer would call from overseas to speak with him were very slim. The internet was the solution.</p>\n\n<p>Emmanuel is also a fervent triathlete. He qualified and made it to the Ironman 70.3 world championship in 2010 and 2012. Emmanuel was part of Team USA&#8217;s triathlon team (M35-39) at the 2011 ITU world championship. </p>\n\n<p>Emmanuel was born in Paris. He has been living in the United States for more than 10 years.
