Bonobo applications have been featured in the New York Times and CNN as well as topping the App Store charts in several countries, both paid and free. Bonobo is a self funded company and was nominated for a 2010 Webby Award.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Bonobo, I was Product Manager at Simmersion where I identified an opportunity to apply their unique 3D technology for the emerging virtual world space. In this role I co-invented patented technology (Australia, USA). I drove their business analysis, product management, marketing, business development and played a key role in capital raising of $1.9m in 2008.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Bonobo","permalink":"bonobo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,54],"assets/images/resized/0006/9874/69874v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,91],"assets/images/resized/0006/9874/69874v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,164],"assets/images/resized/0006/9874/69874v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Yoink!","permalink":"yoink","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[61,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/0541/200541v2-max-150x150.png"],[[61,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/0541/200541v2-max-250x250.png"],[[61,61],"assets/images/resized/0020/0541/200541v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://au.linkedin.com/in/benhamey","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/hamey","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/people/hamey/","title":"Flickr"}]}
