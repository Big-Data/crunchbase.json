He is an entrepreneur, community builder, master of brand development, and has an eye for market opportunities. Brian has an infectious enthusiasm for space, aviation, history and technology, and is passionate about their intersection. His search for a business opportunity involving this powerful combination led him to Germany, where he discovered the Zeppelin NT. After flying on a Zeppelin in Germany during the Soccer World Cup in 2006, he was convinced that this unique flightseeing experience and technology must be brought to the U.S. market. Brian is responsible for the overall strategic direction of Airship Ventures and is particularly excited about the future that lies ahead for airship technology in both commercial and scientific applications.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Airship Ventures","permalink":"airship-ventures","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,145],"assets/images/resized/0004/1128/41128v2-max-150x150.png"],[[144,145],"assets/images/resized/0004/1128/41128v2-max-250x250.png"],[[144,145],"assets/images/resized/0004/1128/41128v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Mark/Space","permalink":"mark-space","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0007/3087/73087v2-max-150x150.png"],[[226,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/3087/73087v2-max-250x250.png"],[[226,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/3087/73087v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Space Angels","permalink":"space-angels","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0003/0856/30856v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0003/0856/30856v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,72],"assets/images/resized/0003/0856/30856v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://venturebeat.com/2009/02/26/airship-ventures-raises-25m-to-bring-zeppelins-to-the-bay-area/","source_description":"Airship Ventures raises $2.5M to bring zeppelins to the Bay Area","raised_amount":2500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Airship Ventures","permalink":"airship-ventures","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,145],"assets/images/resized/0004/1128/41128v2-max-150x150.png"],[[144,145],"assets/images/resized/0004/1128/41128v2-max-250x250.png"],[[144,145],"assets/images/resized/0004/1128/41128v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
