He always had a vision of spreading education to all those, who want to acquire knowledge but lack in resources or have to face a problem of being from an average grade college. He is not a social worker, but is a person, who has faced all these problems, still remained intact, and achieved his goal. Now, he is uplifting his vision of spreading education to all those who have the talent but cannot polish the talent because of proper education amenities.</p>\n\n<p>After completing his degree in Computer Enginnering he had few big offers from various MNCs India and abroad but, he never wanted to let his dream go dim, so, he came to Mumbai. He joined Powai Labs Pvt. Ltd. which was an IIT Bombay startup, as soon he finished his training from Powai; he was appointed as a Research Assistant in IITB.</p>\n\n<p>Always having the thrust to acquire and share his knowledge, he went down to Bangalore and joined the Mobiance Technologies(another IITB initiated Startup) as a Project Manager, then he came back to Mumbai as he got the offer from Reliance BIG Entertainment to join as a Deputy Manager Technology, where he worked for a couple of years.</p>\n\n<p>But, his mission for spreading education led him to leave his job, and now he has fully dedicated himself to this service.
