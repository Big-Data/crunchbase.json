Michael Arrington (born March 13, 1970 in Huntington Beach, California) is a serial entrepreneur and the founder of <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/techcrunch\" title=\"TechCrunch\">TechCrunch</a>, a blog covering startups and technology news.</p>\n\n<p>Arrington attended Claremont McKenna College (BA Economics, 1992) and Stanford Law School (JD, 1995) and practiced as a corporate and securities lawyer at two law firms: O&#8217;Melveny &amp; Myers and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati. His clients included <a href=\"/company/idealab\" title=\"idealab\" rel=\"nofollow\">idealab</a>, <a href=\"/company/netscape\" title=\"Netscape\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netscape</a>, <a href=\"/company/pixar\" title=\"Pixar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pixar</a>, <a href=\"/company/apple\" title=\"Apple\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple</a> and a number of startups, venture funds and investment banks. He also co-authored a book on initial public offerings.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, he left WSGR to join <a href=\"/company/realnames\" title=\"RealNames\" rel=\"nofollow\">RealNames</a> as VP of Business Development and General Counsel. In 2000, he cofounded <a href=\"/company/achex\" title=\"Achex\" rel=\"nofollow\">Achex</a>, an online payments company, that was later acquired by <a href=\"/company/first-data-corporation\" title=\"First Data Corp\" rel=\"nofollow\">First Data Corp</a> for $32 million. Achex is now the back end infrastructure to Western Union online.</p>\n\n<p>Arrington worked in an operational role at a Carlyle backed startup in London, founded and ran two companies in Canada (Zip.ca and Pool.com), was COO to a <a href=\"/financial-organization/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers\" title=\"Kleiner\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kleiner</a>-backed company called <a href=\"/company/razorgator\" title=\"Razorgator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Razorgator</a>, and consulted to other companies, including <a href=\"/company/verisign\" title=\"Verisign\" rel=\"nofollow\">Verisign</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In May 2008, <a href=\"/company/time\" title=\"Time\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time</a> Magazine named Michael Arrington as one of the world&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733758_1735848,00.html\" title=\"100 most influential people\" rel=\"nofollow\">100 most influential people</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conflicts Of Interest</strong></p>\n\n<p>Updated 10/23/12</p>\n\n<p>I am a partner at CrunchFund, a venture capital firm with investments in many startups around the world. I am also a limited partner in many other venture funds which have their own startup investments. </p>\n\n<p>Because of these investments, if there&#8217;s a startup there&#8217;s a good chance I&#8217;m a direct or indirect investor in it. Many times I won&#8217;t even know that I&#8217;m an investor, because venture funds that I invest in don&#8217;t normally share non public information with limited partners.</p>\n\n<p>Also, CrunchFund&#8217;s investors include AOL and many of the top tier venture funds.</p>\n\n<p>That means I invest in a lot of startups. And I invest in a lot of venture funds. And a lot of venture funds have invested in me.</p>\n\n<p>I also occasionally own public company stocks. I currently own shares of Facebook. Until recently I owned shares of AOL. I also own other public company stocks through the management of a third party, although I typically don&#8217;t know about those investments and they are primarily not in the tech industry.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I have so many financial conflicts of interest that I can&#8217;t even keep them straight.</p>\n\n<p>So when you read what I write on Uncrunched, TechCrunch or wherever, understand that I&#8217;m conflicted. A lot.</p>\n\n<p>How do I <a href=\"http://uncrunched.com/2012/02/22/look-this-is-what-it-comes-down-to/\" title=\"deal with this and still write\" rel=\"nofollow\">deal with this and still write</a>?</p>\n\n<p>I addressed it in one of my <a href=\"http://uncrunched.com/2011/09/25/what-exactly-is-uncrunched/\" title=\"first posts on Uncrunched\" rel=\"nofollow\">first posts on Uncrunched</a> in 2011:</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Here are the things you can expect from me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>TRANSPARENCY: I will disclose, as I&#8217;ve always done, all financial conflicts of interest (I have lots and lots of those). I&#8217;ll also disclose other conflicts of interest, like friendships, when I can. I know a lot of you don&#8217;t understand why I can&#8217;t disclose all conflicts of interest. The answer is that if I did, not that many people would want to talk to me in the direct, honest way that I prefer. As a reader you must remain aware of the inherent bias in everything you read, and form your own opinions accordingly. Read <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/tech-press-screw-them-all/\" title=\"this post on TechCrunch\">this post on TechCrunch</a> and the links for more about how I see the world.</p></li>\n<li><p>TRUTH: I always try to find the truth in a situation. That unvarnished, pure nugget of truth at the core of every issue that I write about. Sometimes this takes more than one post, and sometimes I have to go back and correct things I&#8217;ve gotten wrong. I&#8217;ll continue to do that. For more on this, read my post about <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/06/07/the-morality-and-effectiveness-of-process-journalism/\" title=\"process journalism\">process journalism</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>BIAS: I have lots of it, and I never try to ignore it or hide from it. The main thing to know about me is that I&#8217;m a champion of entrepreneurs and the startups they build. They are my rock stars. If in doubt I side with them, and that&#8217;s clear from my writing. For more on this, read my ll always disclose the conflict of interest directly in that post.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/2794/12794v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/2794/12794v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[262,394],"assets/images/resized/0001/2794/12794v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Economics","institution":"Claremont
