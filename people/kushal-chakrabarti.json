In his free time, he runs Ironman triathlons and trains guide dogs for the blind. Kushal was recently named as one of Seattle&#8217;s Top 40 People Under 40 and voted the #1 Game-Changer in Philanthropy by 1.7 million readers on Huffington Post. He is a frequent speaker on youth poverty and education, including SOCAP, Pop!Tech and TEDxBrussels.
