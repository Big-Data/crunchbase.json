As the founder and chief creative officer of the Web-publishing juggernaut Buzzmedia, he turned culture blogs like Idolator and Stereogum into must-reads for todayâ€™s influencers. He was CEO until 2008 and CCO until 2010. He then joined Ashton Kutcher and Jason Goldberg at their founding company Katalyst as President and Head of Digital where he consults for heavyweight brands such as Virgin Media, Intel, and GE on how to design their digital presence and the most effective ways to expand their reach online.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, he was co-founder of Metapa (now Greenplum) a technology company specializing in data warehousing, which sold in July 2010 for $350 million. </p>\n\n<p>Batt, together with Craig Newmark, co-founded Troon, an early San Francisco based web agency and award-winning pioneer of brand published entertainment for the Internet. It was at Troon that Newmark started a side project, which Batt helped take from its original format â€“ an email list to acquaintances â€“ to the eponymous online global destination, Craigslist. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0007/1132/71132v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0007/1132/71132v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,444],"assets/images/resized/0007/1132/71132v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"BUZZ MEDIA","permalink":"buzz-media-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/1777/1777v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/1777/1777v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/1777/1777v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Katalyst","permalink":"katalyst","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder, CCO","firm":{"name":"BUZZMEDIA","permalink":"buzz-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0005/0866/50866v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,53],"assets/images/resized/0005/0866/50866v1-max-250x250.png"],[[288,62],"assets/images/resized/0005/0866/50866v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Anthony Batt CEO & Founder of Buzznet Inc. closes successful series A round lead by Anthem Venture Partners","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":null,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/anthem-venture-partners","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Batt","permalink":"anthony-batt"}},{"description":"Anthony Batt joins Katalyst Films as President","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110311005660/en","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Batt","permalink":"anthony-batt"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
