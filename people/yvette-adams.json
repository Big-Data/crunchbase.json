She started her first business at the age of 17 â€“ a newspaper â€“ which was bought out by an American entrepreneur after its first issue. She created her second business and first e-commerce site in 2002, Tikanga Teeshirts â€“ an online tee-shirt business. Within one month of launching she received a Government Grant and won a website award. </p>\n\n<p>She travelled the world for seven years from 1998 to 2004, the highlight of which was negotiating a free year around the world ticket for herself and her partner, and a digital camera to write a blog and submit pictures to a UK travel website. In between travels she worked in the media, PR &amp; marketing fields across industries.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006 she sold the online teeshirt business and concentrated on launching The Creative Collective a busy and rapidly growing creative services agency offering social media, PR, marketing, branding, websites, online marketing, graphic design, print and more to a wide range of clients located on the Sunshine Coast, inter-state and internationally.
