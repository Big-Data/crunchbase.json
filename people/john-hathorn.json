The company started with their hub website of http://www.spillyourbrain.com but have since moved onto other subsidiaries. Their strongest, and fastest growing website, is Beat My Secret. A recent article featured on KillerStartups.com said this about Beat My Secret.\n &#8220;Everybody loves secrets. Everybody loves when a friend takes him as a confidant and places his full trust on him. Also, the feeling of power that derives from knowing other personâ€™s innermost secrets plays a role that we should not overlook.</p>\n\n<p>That brings me to this site. Named Beat My Secret, it has been devised for people to tell their secrets to the world at large, in an entirely anonymous way. Once a secret has been posted, others can comment on it and also cast a vote and rate it as either a â€œBad secretâ€ or a â€œGood secretâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Secrets are browse-able by category, and seven are featured so far: â€œHealthâ€, â€œKidsâ€, â€œMoneyâ€, â€œLoveâ€, â€œSexâ€ and â€œWorkâ€. The seventh (and final) category is the one named â€œMiscellaneaâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Membership to the site comes at no cost, and creating an actual account is accomplished in a mere couple of minutes. Once the process has been dealt with, you can start posting your own secrets, and interacting with other site users to the full.&#8221;\n(http://www.killerstartups.com/User-Gen-Content/beatmysecret-com-share-your-secrets-with-everybody) </p>\n\n<p>When asked, why the site will be killer?\n&#8220;The site is easy to use, and people being people they will be glued to the kind of content that is revealed (specially the saucier one).&#8221;</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Spill Your Brain","permalink":"spill-your-brain","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0009/1170/91170v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,143],"assets/images/resized/0009/1170/91170v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,257],"assets/images/resized/0009/1170/91170v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.killerstartups.com/User-Gen-Content/beatmysecret-com-share-your-secrets-with-everybody","title":"Killer Startup Review of BMS"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/beatmysecret","title":"Twitter"}]}
