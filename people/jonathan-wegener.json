The digital content we create tells our life stories, but so far this content remains disaggregated and siloed across devices and services. Timehop is a powerful product that brings together all our content into a single re-experience moment.</p>\n\n<p>Before co-founding Timehop, Jonathan created Exit Strategy NYC, the ultimate NYC Subway App (www.exitstrategynyc.com) and also did product development work with many awesome NYC startups.
