My latest is Legalprise; a new type of legal services company.</p>\n\n<p>Before Legalprise I built Blue Ocean Strategy Createware under the supervision of the authors of the book by the same name. Createware is the only authorized practitioner&#8217;s tool for Blue Ocean Strategy. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Blue Ocean Strategy read the book, or check out my blog at www.valueinnovation.net. I&#8217;m also a qualified Blue Ocean Strategy consultant: I&#8217;ve passed an extensive vetting process.</p>\n\n<p>Before Createware that I worked at GE as a product manager integrating a badge making product that I developed at Avery Dennison and which GE licensed. I&#8217;m also the architect or the core software behind personalized postage, in use by stamps.com. Besides photo stamps and the Photo ID system I built an early long-range RF-ID system for file management and box content identification. I came to Avery by writing the software for the Avery Office Products web print software, called FormsServer. Avery acquired the technology.</p>\n\n<p>Before Avery I built a complex legal expert solution for a large insurance company.</p>\n\n<p>Before that I invented the online pregnancy calendar. I&#8217;d like to call it a stroke of genius but it was more a stroke of luck. I was working for Merrill Corporation on a distributed system to manage production through their network of print plants. On my own I tried experimenting with then new web tables to see if I could contextualize information into a calendar format. My wife was pregnant so I used the fetal development information in the books around the house. I built it for her, she gave it to a friend, they gave it to friends and soon it was all over. I sold that to iVillage where it remained their #1 draw for five years, until they rewrote it.</p>\n\n<p>I live in South Florida with my son and two dogs. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/7832/107832v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/7832/107832v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[80,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/7832/107832v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Legalprise, Inc.","permalink":"legalprise-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Blue Ocean Strategy Createware","permalink":"blue-ocean-strategy-createware","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Registry","permalink":"registry","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Product Director","firm":{"name":"General Electric","permalink":"general-electric","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-150x150.png"],[[230,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-250x250.png"],[[230,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/0851/10851v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
