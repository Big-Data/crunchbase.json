After completing his degree Jim started at the bottom run in it with support desk, programming and junior management. His flair and enthusiasm soon landed him a senior role on Information Services Manager in a further educational establishment where his management and project management skills were honed. \nDespite the challenges Jim felt unfulfilled in this role and persuaded Barry Hughes to join him in the creation of their first company, a partnership called niBizNet. After a couple of years of steady growth a new company was formed to take focus on managed services, this company is Fast Tech NI Limited, a rapidly growing company with a bright future.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,149],"assets/images/resized/0006/7740/67740v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,149],"assets/images/resized/0006/7740/67740v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,149],"assets/images/resized/0006/7740/67740v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSc","subject":"Information technology","institution":"University of Ulster, Magee College","graduated_year":1995,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director/Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Fast Tech NI","permalink":"fast-tech-ni","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0006/7590/67590v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0006/7590/67590v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,93],"assets/images/resized/0006/7590/67590v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.fasttechni.com","title":"Fast tech NI Limited"},{"external_url":"http://www.nibiznet.com","title":"niBizNet"},{"external_url":"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jimdkane","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jim_kane","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.jimkane.co.uk","title":"Personal"}]}
