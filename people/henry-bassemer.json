Untreated chemical and even nuclear waste have been dumped illegally in Italy for more than 20 years. </p>\n\n<p>In 2005, while visiting Somalia, Bessemer saw first hand the secondary damage of the tsunami as it disrupted and destroyed dumps where for decades nuclear and chemical waste had been deposited in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Determined that he would use his wealth and influence to stop the destruction of the African coast, he began lobbying for investment in companies that can aid in the clean-up effort.  Since then, reports indicate that Dr. Bessemer and his various foundations have contributed more than one-hundred and thirty million US dollars to the clean-up and restoration of East Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Bessemer&#8217;s campaign in Africa left him with specialist knowledge which is now being used in The Gulf of the United States, following BP&#8217;s oil spill.  Indeed, one of Dr. Bessemer&#8217;s companies was the first to receive US Federal funding to help aid in the clean up efforts.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, Bessemer famously vowed to put at least 60% of his vast family trust toward, â€œresearch and grants into earth-friendly technologies and industries.â€  </p>\n\n<p>â€œI freely acknowledges,â€ he said, â€œthat I am a businessman and industrialist first. However, today, steel recycling go hand-in-hand with environmentalism.â€</p>\n\n<p>Married for 22 years to Abigail, he is the father of two: Henry (Harry) and Gregory.  </p>\n\n<p>Bessemer is a businessman and environmentalist, a philanthropist and an avid sportsman.  His sports activities include skiing, golfing and yachting. He owns one of the largest private yachts in the world: the Eos which is currently anchored off the British coast of Dartmouth.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","firm":{"name":"Bessemer Industries","permalink":"bessemer-industries","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
