We critically review and rate a number of residential and commercial properties based on various criteria such as Location, Facilities, Value for Money and Builder&#8217;s Track Record etc and recommend only the best ones to the clients.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to change the current unorganized nature of the Indian Real Estate industry by presenting useful analysis and information (often overlooked by property buyers) so that the clients can take informed decisions.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that the customers&#8217; opinion is of utmost importance. Therefore, we also provide users an opportunity to post their own reviews and ratings on our website. The collective ratings from multiple users carry more weight and help the potential buyers in selecting the right property.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0008/8942/88942v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[174,78],"assets/images/resized/0008/8942/88942v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[174,78],"assets/images/resized/0008/8942/88942v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
