Greenspan founded eUniverse Inc. in 1998, which went public in 1999. The company survived the economic downturn of 2001 and was the incubator that launched MySpace in 2003, as well as gaming site Skilljam, entertainment destination Flowgo.com, and dating site CupidJunction.</p>\n\n<p>Revision of controversial accounting problems resulting in three quarters of financial results forced a four-month halt in trading of eUniverse stock, which led to Greenspan&#8217;s resignation as CEO of eUniverse later in 2003. </p>\n\n<p>Greenspan owned 10% of Myspace when it was sold to <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation\" title=\"News Corp\">News Corp</a> in 2005, and strongly opposed the acquisition.
