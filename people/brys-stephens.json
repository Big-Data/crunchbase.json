Although his time in the legal world did wonders for the clarity of his thinking, he figured his culinary obsessions would take his legal career only so far.</p>\n\n<p>Brys worked in sales and marketing for American Premium Beverage (a major wine distributor in the Southeast) and later in PR and viticultural management for Joseph Phelps Vineyards. (Phelpsâ€™ 2002 Insignia was recently named Wine Spectatorâ€™s â€œWine of the Year.â€)</p>\n\n<p>Since college, Brys has spent countless hours in the kitchen, watched an unhealthy number of cooking shows and dog-eared his huge library of cookbooks and food magazines.</p>\n\n<p>As a young man, he lived in France and Italy, where he fed off of local markets. He remembers one year at a house near Grasse where a tall thick hedge of rosemary grew off the patio. There was something about grilling a leg of lamb seasoned with rosemary picked ten feet away, something that bound food to place for him, something that was a revelation.</p>\n\n<p>A native of Alabama, Brys now lives in Washington, D.C., where you will periodically find him sermonizing about quinoa from a bench in Rose Park.
