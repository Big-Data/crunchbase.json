The person behind the RedheadWriting persona (on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest – don’t judge), Erika’s a 30-some-odd (ish) writer and business strategist based in Colorado. Her blog, RedheadWriting, began back in 2006 and today delivers “unpopular thoughts and blunt advice,” calling out the overly P.C. in life and in business alike. But it’s not all funny animal photos and unfiltered snark.</p>\n\n<p>Erika consults and speaks nationally on business and online marketing strategy, advising primarily on brand development and social tactics for launching companies. Her work and lessons learned in the branding industry led to the book contract with John Wiley &amp; Sons for &#8220;The Power of Unpopular&#8221; along with a recurring monthly column in Entrepreneur Magazine – both print and online editions. </p>\n\n<p>She has tattoos (!), one small dog, one large dog, doesn’t take her holiday decorations down until the end of January, and (currently) has more bicycles to her name than ex-husbands. She rallies against lactose intolerance with the occasional banana milkshake and has an inexplicable affinity for hedgehogs. An admitted audiophile, her vision of heaven includes a choir headed up by Darryl Hall with Stevie Ray Vaughan on lead guitar. Her iTunes library is a dirty, dirty place — and she likes it that way.</p>\n\n<p>By reading her blog, you might not know that there’s a digital strategy consultancy behind the red head – but alas! Erika’s client list includes a wide range of industries, ranging from national nonprofit organizations to major outdoor retailers and incredible companies across the national startup and tech community. She&#8217;s also a sought-after SEO copywriter for highly visible regional, national, and international brands and is the voice behind many of those snazzy email marketing messages you see in your inbox every day.</p>\n\n<p>Her firm specializes in “keeping companies from looking like a-holes online,” so if you’re looking to come across as one, you probably aren’t her ideal client. In conjunction with selected public relations firms, she develops comprehensive strategies to help companies develop lasting relationships with their customers and clients. And perhaps most importantly, she helps brands become human – because there’s no such thing as B2B or B2C. Business is always H2H – human to human.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/3521/193521v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/3521/193521v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[289,289],"assets/images/resized/0019/3521/193521v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Some rights reserved - Darren Mahuron, Summit Studios (www.summit-style.com)</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Theatre","institution":"University of Houston - University Park","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Head Redhead","firm":{"name":"RHW Media LLC","permalink":"rhw-media-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director - Marketing & Communications","firm":{"name":"InvestorLoft","permalink":"investorloft-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0009/3114/93114v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,153],"assets/images/resized/0009/3114/93114v2-max-250x250.png"],[[400,245],"assets/images/resized/0009/3114/93114v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Senior Manager - Strategic Planning & Development","firm":{"name":"Brand LTD","permalink":"brand-ltd","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"430\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/embed/474dc6945d649\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.unpopularbook.com","title":"The Power of Unpopular (book)"},{"external_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/author/1709","title":"Entrepreneur Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/94.03.TheShattering","title":"The Shattering (Featured on ChangeThis)"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcompany.com//1834404/the-bitch-in-the-boardroom-stereotype-women-speak-out-about-success-and-likeability","title":"Featured in FastCompany \"The Bitch in the Boardroom\""},{"external_url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/03/11/erika-napoletano-the-power-of-unpopular-at-sxsw/","title":"Featured in Forbes"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcompany.com/mba/video/mba2143/erika-napoletano-how-do-you-find-out-what-you-dont-know","title":"Featured on FastCompany's 30-Second MBA"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://redheadwriting.com","title":"RedheadWriting (blog)"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/RedheadWriting","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/RedheadWriting","title":"RedheadWriting on Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/erikanapoletano","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
