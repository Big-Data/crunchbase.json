Whatever keeps him working in hotspots/areas of interest around the world!</p>\n\n<p>Richard’s main areas of expertise are in all things commercial online, business, the evolution of Public Relations and the future of news.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[93,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/1084/171084v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[155,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/1084/171084v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[279,450],"assets/images/resized/0017/1084/171084v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Richard Powell / <a href=\"http://www.presswire.com\" title=\"Presswire\" rel=\"nofollow\">Presswire</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Journalism","institution":"Southampton Solent University","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Managing Director","firm":{"name":"Presswire","permalink":"presswire","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0017/0722/170722v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0017/0722/170722v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0017/0722/170722v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2950070.stm","title":"Richard Powell on BBC News"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10225525&trk=tab_pro","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/presswirePR","title":"Twitter"}]}
