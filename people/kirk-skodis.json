He has over thirty-five  years experience in consumer relationships, since trying to exchange a Corgi 007 Aston Martin at Buddy Brownâ€™s Toys in Studio City because the ejector seat wasnâ€™t ejecting a tiny James Bond. Two weeksâ€™ allowance was at stake and he fought hard to win the sympathy of the skeptical clerk.</p>\n\n<p>Kirk also co-owns and operates Real Pie Media, an award-winning digital creative agency that has pioneered social media marketing strategies for clients like Fox Searchlight, MGM Mirage, Disney and Activision. In 2004, he personally taught Zach Braff how to moblog from airports and hotel lobbies while on his press tour for the film Garden State. In the four years since, the social media landscape has had a profound impact on Kirkâ€™s (and by extension, Real Pieâ€™s) marketing philosophies.</p>\n\n<p>Before starting Real Pie in 2000, Kirk was a successful Animatronics Designer for the Stan Winston Studio. There, he created and performed the Budweiser ferret, The Lost Worldâ€™s stegasaurus and many other hideous creatures. Kirk attended USC School of Cinema &amp; Television and grew up in Los Angeles where he now lives with his co-entrepreneur wife and two children.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/4810/34810v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,225],"assets/images/resized/0003/4810/34810v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,225],"assets/images/resized/0003/4810/34810v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Trustworthy","permalink":"trustworthy","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0003/3596/33596v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0003/3596/33596v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0003/3596/33596v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
