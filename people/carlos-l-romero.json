Strangely, the gangs in his native  &#8220;Edenwald&#8221; projects were interracial. Education took him from The Bronx, through Brooklyn, where he attended the prestigious Brooklyn Technical High School. He traveled through the  South Bronx during the tumultous late 70&#8217;s, when the South Bronx was burning and where Hip Hop was being invented. These elements are what has come to define his explosive chameleon like style. Music is his talent also, playing the electric bass guitar, Carlos was Avant Garde in that respect too. As a concept he auditioned to play bass on live sets with rappers and DJ&#8217;s, to add a heavy low frequency bass, that is now popular to live sessions around 1982 for Afrika Bambaataa, but was not realized as Bambaataa believed the studio bass was enough and was going more technica. Carlos now lives with his two children and pet cat in Greenville, North Carolina. Carlos studied art at Pratt Institute in NYC. He has created everything from book covers for the Ikologiks organization, to designing a trophy case for a WPA Art Deco, Hansborough Recreation Center Bathhouse in Harlem to mounting art shows at The Studio Museum of Harlem. His focus is producing affordable digital computer assisted, painted pieces.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/4535/24535v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[148,220],"assets/images/resized/0002/4535/24535v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[148,220],"assets/images/resized/0002/4535/24535v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Carlos Romero / [Carlos L Romero]9http://www.carloslromero.com)</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"","firm":{"name":"SkyView","permalink":"skyview","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Project Manager","firm":{"name":"CellularVision","permalink":"cellularvision","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Nominated to Who's Who in America","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":30,"source_url":"http://www.marquiswhoswho.com/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Editor-in-Chief, Who's Who in America ","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Romero","permalink":"carlos-l-romero"}}],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"286\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/S-QDK7lMx2Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Wes Nyle Smoke Kush CPirateTV</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://carloslromero.blogspot.com/","title":"Blogspot"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/CPirateTV","title":"facebook"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/CPirateTVkohaus-Avant-Garde-Artsts/182184938496203","title":"CPirateTV"}]}
