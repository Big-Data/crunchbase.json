Whether that community is digital, physical or both, Aaron wants to be a part of it and quite possibly started it.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004, Aaron founded Elevator Up, a web-hosting and web-development company. Through websites, social media and the sponsoring and hosting of events, Elevator Up rapidly established a strong presence in the community.</p>\n\n<p>One of the initiatives Aaron is most passionate about is coworking. He created The Garage in Zeeland, MI and The Factory in Grand Rapids, MIâ€”two venues open to people of all professions and walks of life to visit, work and collaborate. The model scares some at first, but quickly turns most into advocates.</p>\n\n<p>The entrepreneurial spirit in Aaron can only be held down in the sense that he doesnâ€™t like to refer to himself in clichÃ©s. However, he canâ€™t stop himself from being heavily involved with Momentum-mi.com, helping others grow their ideas and start-ups while also launching and co-launching several new ventures of his own, like Downstream (http://downstreamapp.com) and Canvas (http://canvashosting.com).</p>\n\n<p>A strong believer in community and supporter of other entrepreneurs, Aaronâ€™s enthusiasm for growing businesses through relationships is contagious. Thatâ€™s a true community.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3137/103137v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3137/103137v2-max-250x250.png"],[[264,396],"assets/images/resized/0010/3137/103137v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Elevator Up","permalink":"elevator-up","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0001/9607/19607v2-max-150x150.png"],[[166,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/9607/19607v2-max-250x250.png"],[[166,77],"assets/images/resized/0001/9607/19607v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/CEO","firm":{"name":"Downstream","permalink":"downstream","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0011/6614/116614v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,65],"assets/images/resized/0011/6614/116614v2-max-250x250.png"],[[322,85],"assets/images/resized/0011/6614/116614v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/schaapy","title":"schaapy"}]}
