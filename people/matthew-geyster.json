What we came up with was impactbandÂ®. impactbandÂ® features a material called TPU that on impact absorbs 100% of the shock so your iPhone is safe from damage. With this one case you can rest assure that your iPhone will be working perfectly as long as you own it. We take pride in our work and we know you will love impactbandÂ®.</p>\n\n<p>Everything we do is in house. Whether it is shipping our products, photography, designing new products or updating our website, everything is done here. We don&#8217;t have the large overhead that most case companies have so this allows us to have frun with what we do and work on new and exciting projects. We will never make or sell anything that we would not use ourselves and our quality control is done by hand to assure every single product meets our standards. We are very proud of what we do.</p>\n\n<p>BaseOneLabs is a small team of people that work to put out the best niche cases for iPhone 4 and beyond.
