After hearing story after story about untrustworthy firms, brokers and advisors Brian decided there must a better way to communicate to individuals about possible financial hazards. During the latest downturn, there were money managers who were right on the trade betting against the entire mortgage crisis, professionals who foreshadowed the near banking collapse, and individuals who decided not to invest with Madoff &#8211; if they only had a louder voice. Somewhere along the line there was a communication breakdown. In fact, some argue there was not even a line of communication at all. We are here to help bridge that gap and establish a clear line of communication. In December 2008, Brian decided to build this website to help those without a financial advisor get sound advice and help bring accountability and transparency to clients regarding financial firms and advisors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/1316/61316v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[168,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/1316/61316v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[185,275],"assets/images/resized/0006/1316/61316v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>FinanceAnswers.com</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.
