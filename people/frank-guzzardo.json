(NASDAQ: YAHOO), Blue Lithium, and ValueClick (NASDAQ: VCLK).</p>\n\n<p>He began his online career with ValueClick shifting from a pure smile-and-dial approach to a relationship selling approach, resulting in an eye popping $750k monthly ad buy during the darkest post bubble days. He leaped into sales management, training sales teams on relationship selling and refined this philosophy as VP of Eastern Sales for Blue Lithium, where he cast sales people for â€œevangelical zealâ€ producing $60 million in annual revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Yahoo! acquired Blue Lithium for $300 million, where Guzzardo directed Yahoo Network Sales East for three years, ringing in over $300 million. Guzzardo helped spearhead Yahooâ€™s certification of its first and only Full Funnel Attributionâ„¢ vendor (C3 Metrics), after experiencing first-hand knowledge of revenue increases seen by display, search, and advertisersâ€™ overall ad spend.</p>\n\n<p>Frank is a graduate of the University of California, San Diego, and still heeds his fatherâ€™s heavily Brooklyn accented advice that â€œyouâ€™ll never go wrong doing the right thing!â€</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/1551/121551v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,152],"assets/images/resized/0012/1551/121551v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,152],"assets/images/resized/0012/1551/121551v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CRO","firm":{"name":"C3 Metrics","permalink":"c3-metrics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0012/1374/121374v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0012/1374/121374v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,112],"assets/images/resized/0012/1374/121374v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
