Because while The Stone Foxes may be influenced by the greats of the late 60s and early 70s like The Band, Bob Dylan, and Led Zeppelin, they never sound like theyâ€™re trying to be anything but exactly who they are. But then they donâ€™t need to, their style of blues-rock stands on its own.â€¨â€¨What makes the  The Stone Foxes so unique is their approach to making music.â€¨â€¨&#8221;Weâ€™ll never be a traditional studio band,â€ says Aaron. That makes perfect sense to anyone thatâ€™s been to one of their shows: itâ€™s clear the Foxes care far more about performing their music for living, breathing human beings than an empty room filled with microphones.â€¨\nThe Stone Foxes released their second full length record &#8220;Bear &amp; Bulls&#8221; in 2010 and  rather than holing up in a studio, writing songs in a void, then cutting an album and touring it, The Stone Foxes worked their new material out on stage over a period of months, playing it for their fans, andd thatâ€™s part of what makes their shows, and their recordings so good. Each song in their arsenal has evolved organically over time, taking on a unique personality while retaining the core DNA that makes it a Stone Foxes original. Every song, every lick, every fill on Bears and Bulls has had its own unique path to maturity, taking the energy and feedback from the live experience and making it a critical part of the music. â€¨â€¨ In order to capture the real soul of the music it would be critical to maintain that energy, those unique aspects of each song. So Bears &amp; Bulls was recorded with virtually no overdubs, at a studio they built themselves.  Itâ€™s a reflection of their live show and a tribute to the interplay between musicians and fans. Itâ€™s a moment in time captured digitally, then mixed by Alex Newport and mastered by John Cuniberti in beautiful, warm, old-school analog. Just like it should be. </p>\n\n<p>NPR said that Bears &amp; Bulls &#8220;&#8230;.tackles ambitious arrangements with diverse moods ranging from acoustic twang to thunderous electric-guitar riffs.â€ The SF Chronicle claims that &#8220;In much the same way Jack White salvaged dinosaur guitar jams from the ashes of 1980s Arena Rawk excess, the Stone Foxes use these grooves to tell their own contemporary San Francisco stories, &#8221; and Jambase said that &#8220;&#8230;Bears &amp; Bulls is one of the best records to slide across the JamBase desk this year.&#8221; Bears &amp; Bulls was featured in iTunes New &amp; Noteworthy, peaked at #4 FMQB&#8217;s Sub Modern Albums chart, was featured on NPR&#8217;s &#8220;World Cafe: Next&#8221; and the band was picked as Relix Magazine&#8217;s #1 On the Verge Artist.</p>\n\n<p>The Stone Foxes music has been featured on Showtime&#8217;s Shameless, USA&#8217;s Sons of Anarchy and most recently on the National ad campaign for Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey performing the blues classic &#8220;I&#8217;m a King Bee,&#8221; which was the last recording done Avi Vincour.</p>\n\n<p>The band has been on the road winning over audiences all over the west coast including a opening for the  Black Keys in Phoenix, and will continue on tour doing club and festival dates, including Wakarusa, Outside Lands, Deluna Fest, Jazz Aspen Snowmass Summer Series and The New Orleans Voodoo Experience. The band is writing and recording to support the upcoming summer dates on which fellow Bay Area musician, Elliot Peltzman is lending a hand on keys for the recording and tour. \nâ€¨So youâ€™ve got this band of players that can actually play, writers that can actually write, none of whom seem to have much ego: itâ€™s about the music and the band over all â€“ not the individual. You turn them loose to create songs that evolve and mature over time, then you drop them in a studio to track a record or on stage to play a show. As it turns out, what you end up getting is something way deeper and more heartfelt than most bands ever deliver.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/1846/161846v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/1846/161846v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0016/1846/161846v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
