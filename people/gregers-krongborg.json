At that time, in the aftermath of the Information Tech Bubble, Danish Venture Capitalism has just imploded, he recalls. The critical mass of Venture Capital firms simply wasn&#8217;t there, and then Northzone stepped in.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to joining Northzone, Gregers was an active and hands-on business angel and member of the formal Danish business angel network. Gregers co-founded the Danish broadband start-up COCOM in the mid-90&#8217;s.</p>\n\n<p>COCOM was acquired by Cisco in 1999 and Gregers served as general manager of Cisco Cable Products and Solutions in Denmark. Prior to co-founding COCOM, Gregers was management consultant and partner in Bisballe Planlï¿½gning serving Danish and international clients, and he served as expert and evaluator to the European Commission R&amp;D programs.</p>\n\n<p>When not investing time and money with Northzone, Gregers actually finds joy in Real Estate projects, having initiated a sizeable rental apartment project outside Copenhagen in Denmark, a venture that already delivers attractive cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>Gregers holds a M.Sc. in Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark, and a B.Sc. in Business Administration from Copenhagen Business School. Gregers serves as Chairman of the Board of Asetek and Proxilliant and as a Director of  Napatech, NanoFreeze and the Danish Venture Capital and Private Equity Association.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/9648/29648v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0002/9648/29648v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,254],"assets/images/resized/0002/9648/29648v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
