He focuses on licensing and human resources. He entered the Browsergame sphere in 2003, still as an apprentice, when he created the game Tribal Wars together with the brothers Eike and Hendrik Klindworth. Today, Tribal Wars is one of the most successful Browsergames ever, with 33 million users from more than 200 countries. Creating the first playable version only took them one month of programming. InnoGames was in 2007 founded as a consequence of this huge success and today has more than 50 million users.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/1820/101820v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[207,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/1820/101820v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[261,314],"assets/images/resized/0010/1820/101820v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Michael Zillmer</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Director & Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"InnoGames","permalink":"innogames","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0008/7531/87531v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,135],"assets/images/resized/0008/7531/87531v1-max-250x250.png"],[[292,158],"assets/images/resized/0008/7531/87531v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
