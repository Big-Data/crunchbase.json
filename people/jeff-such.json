After organizing nationwide during the 2008 Presidential elections, he worked on down-ballot campaigns and learned firsthand that only the most well-funded candidates have access to the latest web technologies. He co-founded Stumpwise to correct that inequity and remove any barriers preventing direct communication between candidate/elected official and voter.</p>\n\n<p>When heâ€™s not democratizing political technology, Jeff can be found outdoors skiing, hiking, or camping. He lives in San Francisco with his dog â€“ and home-state namesake â€“ Jersey.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/9338/99338v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[207,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/9338/99338v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[373,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/9338/99338v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"M.P.S.","subject":"Political Management (Electoral Politics)","institution":"The George Washington University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"International Relations (Political Science)","institution":"Lehigh University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & President","firm":{"name":"Stumpwise","permalink":"stumpwise","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
