MOC stands for â€œModality of Choiceâ€ and MED stands simply for â€œMedicineâ€.</p>\n\n<p>Let us understand Modality of Choice better Modality of Choice actually means the various modes available for diagnosis of a particular disease or clinical condition. Want to understand it better? Let us look at this example. If you have fractured your leg the doctor / medical practitioner has to first recommend an X-Ray. This is the first Modality of Choice. After looking at the X-Ray, if the Medical Practitioner determines that the fracture is compound, he may want to recommend a CT scan. So in this case CT scan becomes the second Modality of Choice. Assuming the Medical Practitioner wants to look into the tissue and bone damage caused by the fracture, he may recommend an MRI which becomes the third Modality of Choice.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,63],"assets/images/resized/0015/1805/151805v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,106],"assets/images/resized/0015/1805/151805v2-max-250x250.png"],[[350,149],"assets/images/resized/0015/1805/151805v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Games</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
