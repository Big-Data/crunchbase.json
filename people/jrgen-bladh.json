One could rightly claim that Jï¿½rgen fits the Northzone bill perfectly: His background includes co-founding and building two companies (eLearning start-up AcadeMedia and the high-speed Internet access company Thalamus Networks), both which was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, management and ownership of a small engineering company during a challenging turnaround process, and Management Consultancy at McKinsey &amp; Co.  </p>\n\n<p>Those who have met Jï¿½rgen in negotiations often bear witness to his relentless attention to, and memory for, important details. However, nothing less is to be expected from a man who is able to discuss the finer details and strategies of virtually any football team of importance (and actually, a few of very little overall impact) since the early seventies. </p>\n\n<p>Jï¿½rgen holds a M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Linkï¿½ping, Sweden, and an MBA from MIT Sloan School in Boston (1991).</p>\n\n<p>Jï¿½rgen serves as Chairman of the Board of Envox, and as Director in Xcerion, Norstel and Edvantage Group. Privately, he also holds an investment in one of Sweden&#8217;s leading Football Magazines.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/9651/29651v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/9651/29651v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[219,329],"assets/images/resized/0002/9651/29651v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Northzone","permalink":"northzone-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,75],"assets/images/resized/0001/6117/16117v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
