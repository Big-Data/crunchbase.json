He focuses all 88 of his self-reported IQ points into helping college students build their FICO.  </p>\n\n<p>He and his mentor hacked the Fair Isaac Co (FICO) credit scoring algorithm.  To maximize credit score, tips are sent in fortune cookie sized text messages delivered monthly to a college students cell phone.  He cut-and-pasted the technique of &#8216;second stage premiums&#8217; where you give more pizza after the initial slice of pizza given out on campus.</p>\n\n<p>He wrote the book, <a href=\"http://www.whattheydontteachyouatstanfordbusinessschool.com\" title=\"What They Donâ€™t Teach You At Stanford Business School\" rel=\"nofollow\">What They Donâ€™t Teach You At Stanford Business School</a>, blogs at <a href=\"http://www.whattheydontteachyouatstanfordbusinessschool.com/business-week-larry-chiang.htm\" title=\"Business Week\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Week</a>, GP at <a href=\"www.pehub.com/123451/texas-seed-firm-partners-with-hyper-networker-larry-chiang-to-target-stanford-entrepreneurs/\" title=\"Larry Chiang G51 Fund of Stanford Founders\" rel=\"nofollow\">Larry Chiang G51 Fund of Stanford Founders</a> and teaches ENGR 145 as EIR (entrepreneur in residence)<a href=\"http://http://www.facebook.com/stanford.engineering\" title=\"in the school of engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">in the school of engineering</a>. </p>\n\n<p>His role at Stanford has been interesting, controversial and ever-evolving. He first started as a fringe Stanford Athletics supporter where he has been a season ticket holder since 1999. He used a relationship with Ty Warner of Oak Brook IL to facilitate Stanford Athletic&#8217;s toy drive. He went from crasher to unofficial chair of Stanford Entrepreneur Week when he charged VCs to attend a free event that the GSB hosted annually; its their Entrepreneurship Mixer. Under Chiang&#8217;s self-appointed unofficial chairmanship, Stanford Entrepreneurship is now a month long. It is also interesting to note that two administrators that went against him were removed. He serves as EIR under tenured professor Thomas J Kosnik. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0010/3288/103288v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0010/3288/103288v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0010/3288/103288v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Brian Solis</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Engineering","institution":"University of Illinois (Urbana)","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"SSE Labs","permalink":"sse-labs","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0009/0159/90159v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,60],"assets/images/resized/0009/0159/90159v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,109],"assets/images/resized/0009/0159/90159v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Started Duck9 with Matt Smith and Steven Brightman","stoned_year":2004,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":10,"source_url":"http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources&id=3662820","source_text":null,"source_description":"ABC News","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Larry","last_name":"Chiang","permalink":"larry-chiang"}},{"description":"Started Guest Blogging (at GigaOm) (6/24/07)","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":24,"source_url":"http://gigaom.com/2008/02/21/howtoworktheroom/","source_text":null,"source_description":"How to Work the Room 4.0","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Larry","last_name":"Chiang","permalink":"larry-chiang"}}],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"370\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ejeIz4EhoJ0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":""}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://chronicle.com/weekly/v46/i47/47a05901.htm","title":"Chronicle of Higher Education"},{"external_url":"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1065286","title":"NPR"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pckbk9_1WOE","title":"CNN NY"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGEcnryZSXU","title":"CNN Chicago"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/larry.chiang","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/A26F6JYJHRMNU8","title":"Amazon"}]}
