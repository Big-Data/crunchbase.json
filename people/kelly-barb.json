Their policy has always been to continuously improve sourcing raw materials. They believe that suppliers are working with them. They always take a long term view on working with suppliers and aim to develop a mutually beneficial partnership. The production of their willow hampers comes from the villagers. The villages all work in co-operation with a larger central finishing factory which they supply with their part finished wicker products. They take pride on their baked goodies, exquisitely packed in food hampers.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
