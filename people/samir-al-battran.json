He is the founder of TweepsMap and co-founder of RentCompass.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career Samir worked on a variety of technologies and products, ranging from shrink wrapped software such as the world renown Corel Wordperfect Office to web based systems like Nielsen&#8217;s Answers Web (dubbed by Gartner as offering the most complete strategic information for consumer goods manufacturers), or mobile embedded and telematics systems. He also worked on a range of medical imaging systems including the world&#8217;s leading ophthalmology and PACS systems and the most advanced zero foot-print medical imaging viewer.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009 Samir realized a gap in the Canadian market for mobile apps with Canadian content so he co-founded RentCompass, the first Canadian service for finding rentals on mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 he founded TweepsMap, a location based social media analytics service that provides visualization of Twitter followers on an interactive Map. TweepsMap proved to be a big hit and was featured on major media blogs and technology shows.</p>\n\n<p>In his spare time, Samir likes to build free Android apps, some of which are amongst the most downloaded apps in Canada.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0017/3853/173853v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0017/3853/173853v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0017/3853/173853v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MSC","subject":"Computing","institution":"Imperial College of London","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Rent Compass","permalink":"rent-compass","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/6014/96014v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/6014/96014v2-max-250x250.png"],[[280,280],"assets/images/resized/0009/6014/96014v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","firm":{"name":"Connexinet","permalink":"connexinet","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0017/1441/171441v2-max-150x150.png"],[[240,42],"assets/images/resized/0017/1441/171441v2-max-250x250.png"],[[240,42],"assets/images/resized/0017/1441/171441v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.techvibes.com/blog/connexinet-a-canadian-location-based-app-building-success-story-2012-01-23","title":"Article on TechVibes"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/albattran","title":"Samir Al-Battran - LinkedIn profile"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/100744521251453053070/posts#100744521251453053070/about","title":"Samir Al-Battran - Google+"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/tweepsmap","title":""}]}
