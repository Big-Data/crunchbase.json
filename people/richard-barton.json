He is currently co-founder and executive chairman of Zillow, Inc., a real estate marketplace he co-founded in 2005 that went public in 2011 (NASDAQ: Z). Prior to Zillow, Rich founded Expedia inside Microsoft in 1994 at the age of 26, pioneering a new model that gave consumers more control over their travel and demonstrated how powerful e-commerce could be. He built the original Expedia team then spun out the company in a successful IPO in 1999, serving as President, Chief Executive Officer and Board Director through the company’s acquisition by IAC Corp in 2003. He co-founded Zillow with many of his former Expedia executives with the goal to bring the same level of transparency to real estate that they brought to travel a decade earlier. Today, Zillow has expanded beyond its trademark Zestimate® to become the largest real estate platform on mobile and the desktop. </p>\n\n<p>Rich has also taken pages from his “power to the people” playbook and in 2007 co-founded Glassdoor, a social career and jobs community, where he currently serves as non-executive chairman. He is also co-founder of Trover, a mobile app helping people find and share their “discoveries” around the world, and King of the Web, a entertainment and social gaming startup.  He is a Venture Partner at Benchmark Capital and is also on the boards of  Nextdoor, Netflix, RealSelf, Avvo and YearUp.  His angel investments include stakes in such innovative startups as Hotel Tonight, Hipmunk, Room 77, Decide, Qliance, Duetto, Seattle Bank, Revinate, Hark, and Zapd.</p>\n\n<p>Rich holds a Bachelor’s of Science in General Engineering: Industrial Economics from Stanford University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,131],"assets/images/resized/0001/6470/16470v1-max-150x150.png"],[[97,131],"assets/images/resized/0001/6470/16470v1-max-250x250.png"],[[97,131],"assets/images/resized/0001/6470/16470v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Industrial
