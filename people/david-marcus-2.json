He started his first company, GTN telecom, back in 1996 in Geneva, Switzerland. GTN became one of the top three alternative carriers in Switzerland and was acquired by World Access in 2000. In 2000, he founded Echovox, a leading mobile media monetization company that helps large media companies connect with their mobile audiences. In building out Echovox, David built direct relationships and connections with mobile operators around the world. This formed the foundation for Zong, which was spun out of Echovox . Convinced of the massive opportunity in front of him, David in early 2008 moved his company to the Silicon Valley, where he feels right at home.</p>\n\n<p>David is a regular speaker at events such as the Virtual Goods Summit, CTIA Wireless, World Mobile Congress (formerly 3GSM), World Economic Forum-SKU, TechCrunch CrunchUps, GigaOm Mobilize, and numerous high profile industry events.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7037/17037v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[158,171],"assets/images/resized/0001/7037/17037v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[158,171],"assets/images/resized/0001/7037/17037v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Zong","permalink":"zong","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0002/4680/24680v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,120],"assets/images/resized/0002/4680/24680v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,217],"assets/images/resized/0002/4680/24680v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chairman","firm":{"name":"Vox Telecom","permalink":"vox-telecom","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"founder, board of directors","firm":{"name":"Echovox","permalink":"echovox","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0008/5040/85040v1-max-150x150.png"],[[207,60],"assets/images/resized/0008/5040/85040v1-max-250x250.png"],[[207,60],"assets/images/resized/0008/5040/85040v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"GTN Telecom","permalink":"gtn-telecom","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"TwitterFone","permalink":"twitterfone","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0001/8050/18050v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0001/8050/18050v1-max-250x250.png"],[[344,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/8050/18050v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/davidmarcus","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/dmarcus","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.honestly.com/profile?id=465033","title":"Honestly.com Reviews"}]}
