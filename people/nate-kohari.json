During his experience in the software industry, he recognized that while the majority of focus is placed on the initial development of a software product, most of the effort is actually spent on the product&#8217;s maintenance and development after launch.

Nate also believes deeply in the value of open source software, and previously created Ninject, a popular dependency injection framework.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/9704/149704v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/9704/149704v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0014/9704/149704v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CTO","firm":{"name":"Enkari, Ltd.","permalink":"zen","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,69],"assets/images/resized/0005/2820/52820v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,115],"assets/images/resized/0005/2820/52820v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,207],"assets/images/resized/0005/2820/52820v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
