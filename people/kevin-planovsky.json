After stints at traditional agencies (Arras Group, Initiative Media), Kevinâ€™s early career was spent managing accounts, new business, and mobile for brands like AutoTrader.com, InterContinental Hotels, Disney, and Home Depot at Nurun Ant Farm Interactive. This eventually led to his most recent client-side gig as Marketing Manager of Zipcar Atlanta where Kevin helped lead a challenging car-sharing market into profitability with triple digit growth in both membership and revenue in under two years.
