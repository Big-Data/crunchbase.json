Previously he was a software engineer at Six Apart, where he was working on new ways to power online conversation and build interactive communities. Mike is an advocate for open source and open standards technologies. He contributes regularly to Django, an open source Python Web framework that encourages rapid development without sacrificing quality. Mike is active in the OAuth and Activity Streams standards efforts, and is a member of the Open Web Foundation, an organization whose goal is to develop best practices for creating community-driven specifications. Before joining Six Apart, Mike helped build the microblogging web site Pownce, where he learned a lot about the technical and social difficulties of scaling an online community. He&#8217;s currently focused on building tools and technologies that will address some of these difficulties, which he hopes will create a more open social web ecosystem.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/6980/16980v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[179,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/6980/16980v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[322,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/6980/16980v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Virginia Tech","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Lead Architect","firm":{"name":"SimpleGeo","permalink":"simplegeo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0004/4332/44332v19-max-150x150.png"],[[250,45],"assets/images/resized/0004/4332/44332v19-max-250x250.png"],[[450,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/4332/44332v19-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Developer","firm":{"name":"Pownce","permalink":"pownce","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0000/0925/925v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0000/0925/925v1-max-250x250.png"],[[285,100],"assets/images/resized/0000/0925/925v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Engineer","firm":{"name":"Six Apart","permalink":"six-apart","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4339/4339v1-max-150x150.png"],[[96,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4339/4339v1-max-250x250.png"],[[96,54],"assets/images/resized/0000/4339/4339v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://immike.net/","title":"I'm Mike"}]}
