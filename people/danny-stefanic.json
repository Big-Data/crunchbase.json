This was later licensed by the US technology multinational IPIX.</p>\n\n<p>In 1996 he was approached by a company called 3D Cubed, which captured his attention as they were interested in beginning an e-commerce solution in 3D â€“ an area that, as President of the Virtual Reality Association, was especially close to his heart. He ended up developing the software ShopFactory, a program that allows businesses to create professional 3D online shops and has since become a leading e-commerce solution with more than 50,000 shops based on its secure shopping cart software solutions.</p>\n\n<p>He decided to leave 3D Cubed after a few years to pursue his interest in 3D and the virtual reality space, and in 2000 ExitReality.com was registered. From that point on he has focused all his time, energy and efforts into developing the perfect 3D Internet. He saw 3D as an untapped market, a media type yet to be fully adopted by the mass market of web users.</p>\n\n<p>After nearly a decade of hard work, he couldnâ€™t be more proud and excited for ExitReality officially coming out of private beta and globally launching to the public in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2007, world-leading IT research &amp; advisory company, Gartner, made the prediction that â€œ80 Percent of Active Internet Users Will Have A â€˜Second Lifeâ€™ in the Virtual World by the End of 2011â€. With the launch of ExitReality, the aim is to potentially bring that predication date a lot closer!</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"ExitReality","permalink":"exitreality","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7375/17375v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/7375/17375v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,110],"assets/images/resized/0001/7375/17375v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
