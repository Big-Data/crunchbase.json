He pioneered a process whereby the mercury used in the gold mining industry was economically and safely removed from the mine workings.  Since then, he has become known for his  large scale environmental projects, including the clean-up of toxic waste sites in Somalia and Mozambique, and now in the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I freely acknowledge,â€ he famously said, â€œthat I am a businessman and industrialist first. However, today, steel recycling goes hand-in-hand with environmentalism.â€</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, after visiting Somalia, Von Strasser vowed to put at least 60% of his vast wealth into, â€œcompanies, research and grants focused on earth-friendly economic development.â€   Von Strasser saw first hand the secondary damage of the tsunami as it disrupted and destroyed dumps where for decades nuclear and chemical waste had been deposited in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Determined that he would use his wealth and influence to stop the destruction of the African coast, he began lobbying for investment in companies that can aid in the clean-up effort. Since then, reports indicate that Von Strasser and his various foundations have contributed more than one-hundred and thirty million US dollars to the clean-up and restoration of East Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Von Strasser&#8217;s campaign in Africa left him with specialist knowledge which is now being used in the Gulf of Mexico, following BP&#8217;s oil spill. Indeed, one of his companies was the first to receive US Federal funding to help aid in the clean up efforts.  He currently is chairman of the board of Central Europe Reclamations GmBH in Austria, a large steel and plastic recycler with facilities throughout Europe.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"C.E.O.","firm":{"name":"Central European Waste Management (Austria)","permalink":"central-europe-waste-management","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0012/2850/122850v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[223,105],"assets/images/resized/0012/2850/122850v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[223,105],"assets/images/resized/0012/2850/122850v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Frederick Von Strasser acquired majority stake in Paradigm Industrial Metals.","stoned_year":1993,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":12,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"Forbes","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Von Strasser","permalink":"frederick-von-strasser"}},{"description":"Paradigm Industrial Metals merges with Vulcan Holdings AG, acquiring several smaller Central European recycling enterprises.
