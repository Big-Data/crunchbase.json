He has not looked back since, and he has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 every year since 2002. Anthony was born in Cleveland, Ohio, graduated from Holy Name High School in 1998, and earned a B.S. from The University of Akron in Accountancy. Anthony went on to form Davian Capital L.P., a long/short hedge fund, and decided to launch The Davian Letter in October 2008 to help out those investors the SEC deems too â€œaverageâ€ to invest in hedge funds. Currently, Anthony reside in Akron, Ohio with his lovely wife Danielle and his two crazy bulldogs â€“ Hank â€œthe tankâ€ and Woody &#8220;Bears.&#8221;</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S","subject":"Accounting ","institution":"The University of Akron","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"davianletter.com","permalink":"davianletter-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Stock.ly","permalink":"stock-ly","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,139],"assets/images/resized/0007/0367/70367v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,232],"assets/images/resized/0007/0367/70367v2-max-250x250.png"],[[306,284],"assets/images/resized/0007/0367/70367v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Davian Capital Advisors","permalink":"davian-capital-advisors","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
