At age 14, however, he got tired of milking, and turned to QBasic. So began his love-affair with algorithms (or perhaps just explosive bananas). He did undergraduate in computer science and Spanish at SUNY Potsdam, with a year in LeÃ³n, Spain to study CS in Spanish. For a final project, he wrote a parallel implementation of the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve factoring algorithm. Justin.tv was his first job out of school. He began by hacking on Usher, the brain of the Justin.tv video system, where he&#8217;s built inter-datacenter stream replication and flash crowd detection, and added on-demand transcoding to support mobile viewers. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,149],"assets/images/resized/0016/5611/165611v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,199],"assets/images/resized/0016/5611/165611v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,199],"assets/images/resized/0016/5611/165611v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder CTO","firm":{"name":"Socialcam","permalink":"socialcam","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0012/1876/121876v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0012/1876/121876v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,98],"assets/images/resized/0012/1876/121876v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Hacker","firm":{"name":"Justin.TV","permalink":"justintv","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[148,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7031/27031v20-max-150x150.png"],[[148,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7031/27031v20-max-250x250.png"],[[148,40],"assets/images/resized/0002/7031/27031v20-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
