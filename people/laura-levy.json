Following emerging trends in the rich media landscape, Ms. Levy Shatkin brought the Taste library of broadcast quality food and wine segments onto the Internet for on-demand viewing via the creation and launch of WinePeeks.tv.  Since WinePeeks.tvâ€™s inception, over three-dozen Internet sites have requested syndication rights and through Brightcove.com, the site is accessible on Yahoo Video and AOL Video.  WinePeeks.tv now merges with <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/winetastetv\" title=\"WineTasteTV\">WineTasteTV</a>, and the two brands move forward as WineTasteTV with Ms. Levy Shatkin bringing her considerable skills to the venture.
