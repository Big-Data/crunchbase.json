by and skillfully studied as a System and devised his own &#8216;Liberation&#8217;, since and before being &#8220;Classified&#8221; as a &#8216;Gifted Prodigy&#8217; by a Public Government Institution on the Eastern Seabord, through a sequence of &#8220;Studies&#8221; including the Cornell Battery Test on Intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>Dissatisfied with the Arbitrary Categorization of Diverse Human Potentiality, and the Canalization of Arbitrarily recognized Merit and Control of an &#8220;Artificial Meritocracy&#8221;, he proved an early &#8220;Black Sheep&#8221; by shunning the &#8216;Questionable Favors&#8217; of the Latter, by taking an Entrepreneurial Route that began at the Age of 12 with his first Virtual Company called &#8216;Ars Philatelica/ Philatelia&#8217; - which was based on Auctioning Rare Postage Stamps and Collectible Philatelic Parapharnalia on International Auction Houses such as Stanley Gibbons, and Cherrystone Auction Centers.  </p>\n\n<p>Having ensured his own Fiscal Continuuity and proven himself as an Early Capacitor in understanding Artifices of the Money Markets as invariably understood through the Trade of Philatelic Dealing and Imports/Exports, he &#8220;moved on&#8221; to his second and third passions : Being Classical Book and Music, opening a number of Online and Offline Outlets dealing with their dissemination, purchase, and eventually extending to Antique Furnishings and Warehousing. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Social Enterprise streak, motivated by a &#8216;Vision to Empower Fellow Man&#8217; proved to be a transcendental passion, and Alexander was awarded a Scholarship Fund by a local Community College&#8217;s Department of Psychology, in the amount of $300, and invited to Join the Psychology Honor Society Psi Beta in early 2004, for creating a Paradigm Shift Model that successfully aligned Public and Private participatory regimes to work for and not against the Nation&#8217;s most Innovation/Discovery Inclined Youth.</p>\n\n<p>He was featured in Local and National News Commentary, mentioned additionally in the Local Papers &#8220;The Sun Series&#8221;, Cited in Think Tanks, awarded &#8216;National Leadership Award&#8217;, and &#8216;Businessman of the Year for 2006&#8217; by the D.C. based Business Advisory Council, and profiled in WSJ in a sponsored Award Ceremony Listing, as well as invited by MENSA to community meetings, and to participate in Scholarship Funds dedicated to Youth Entrepreneurship, Empowerment, and Pursuits. </p>\n\n<p>The Not-For-Profit 501 c 3 entity &#8216;The Alternative Pathway Program Foundation&#8217; was formally discharged on 2007, due to the attrition of labor and demands on personal ingenuity geared towards other corridors and alignments with a greater overarching priority.</p>\n\n<p>A theme of Exploration and &#8216;Tinkering&#8217; with Academia marked a period of Experimentation with Institutional Potentialities, coinciding with Alexander&#8217;s apparent Graduate-Post-Graduate Entrepreneurial Endeavors in other Industries and Disciplinary Regimes, extending to Biometrics, Data Modeling, Process Design, Algorithm Design, Neurology, Engineering, Architecture, and Meta-Architecture. </p>\n\n<p>As a Businessman, he successfully maintained Agreements based Contracts and collected Retainer Fees for having provided uncommon Edge and Strategic Value Maximization to several present day Fortune 100 companies and Small Firms, which provided reciprocal advantages in Liquidity and Dissemination of Trade Specialized Know-How Streams, including to Merchants and Curators and Subsidiaries of Wal Mart, as well as Hugo Boss, Armani, Phaidon Books, and a Keynote Project dealing with Hybrid &#8216;Nouveau-Zeppelin&#8217; Technology, &#8220;Dynalifter Enterprise&#8221; whose Vision he architected at a Policy Level, but later left the Company which failed to Internationalize the Vision on their part.  </p>\n\n<p>The Students of the original Gifted Non-Profit, also successfully pursued career pathways towards acclaimed Academic and Scholarly Institutions as capacitators and servitors of Transformational Aims, finding niches in Georgetown University, Darthmouth College, Johns Hopkins, while others received substantial Merit Based Scholarships and Aid in recognition of the Works catalyzed under the guided supervision or inspiration of the Foundation.  </p>\n\n<p>Alexander, who expressed lucid interest in &#8216;Genuine Free Market Values&#8217; and Laissez Faire principles was solicited to Join the NRCC ( National Republican Congressional Committee ) and maintained an Honorary Chairperson membership for two years, eventually leaving the Party out of detriment of Dissatisfaction in relation to the irreconcilable habits, traits, and deficits that made further involvement Philosophically Unconscionable, which he clarified amply to his Peers and Professional Allies. </p>\n\n<p>He instead, joined the American Libertarian Party in 2006, believing Social Enterprise, Trade, and Ethical Frameworks of galvanizing the Private Sectors, and generally promoting the Ideals of Liberty, Self-Reliance, and Moral Values with the vested Protective Elements of the Classical American Constitution and Jeffersonian Letters would better promote larger International Ties of Sovereignty, Parity, and Standards of Transparency necessary to &#8217; Utilizing Good Means towards Good Ends &#8216;. </p>\n\n<p>In this Light the Gifted Program and its Brief Publications and Revues, at the height of its phase were notable for earning the accolade of the Davidson Foundation of Gifted Youth, originally founded by Jan and Bob Davidson who authored the Seminal Book &#8216;Genius Denied&#8217;, critiquing prevailing Social Policy on par with Richard Florida ( Creative Class ), and Alvin Toffler ( Revolutionary Wealth ) , - espousing that Public and Private priorities and incumbent awareness has proven far too Senile, Gratuitous, Degraded, and Incompetent, or plainly Uninformed to Inform and hold in Useful Appraisal the Candid Merits and Potentialities of American Youth. </p>\n\n<p>A View widely accepted and admitted by &#8220;Confessions&#8221; of many Ivy League Professors, Futurists, and Successful Entrepreneurs in 2009, and markedly pronounced in World Class TED Conferences. </p>\n\n<p>The Industrial Regime as notorious in its &#8216;Spoils on the Land and the People&#8217; in the American Coasts,  whose residential centers have been referred to by the Social Critique and Urban Historian James Howard Kunstler, as &#8220;The National Automobile Slum&#8221;, was the aim of Alexander&#8217;s &#8216;Ecology of Mind, Body, Soul&#8217; centered Reform by Awareness and Empowerment of Agenda, and in Press Interviews he referred to his attempts and aspirations to transform the condition of those slightly younger than his age when he started, as a &#8220;Matter of Civic and Personal Responsibility to my Generation &#8212; and as such a Goliathan Challenge&#8221; &#8212; referring to the Challenges Ahead as &#8220;Alchemic in Nature&#8221;, in context to the Idea of proverbial Lead being &#8216;Transmuted&#8217; through Dedicated Innovation and Passionate Appraisal into proverbial &#8216;Gold&#8217;, within the reach of Commons. </p>\n\n<p>He spoke with wit and subtlety about his summative encounters, rendezvous, and ironies in brokering REAL Social Change and Transformational Wishes, and indicated an awareness of the illusion, fear, corruption, absurdity, and tomfoolery that acted as thwarting agents to his first Progressive hybrid Eco-Private-Public Social Enterprise. </p>\n\n<p>Alexander especially spoke of vivid encounters with Incompetent and Superfluous authorities and the rampant culture of corruption and pseudo-legislation that continues to harass Transformational Capacity in a Nation - and State that needs it the most. United States, and The State of New Jersey. </p>\n\n<p>That is where the Nationally acknowledged Gifted Center was originally located and its preliminary settings were established. </p>\n\n<p>In 2009, the media itself has iconically presented the challenges of corruption and malign turmoils that have &#8220;leaked out&#8221; through major news stories representing what the Founder of the Gifted Youth Organization had at one time harnessed Positively to Transform into Currency of Innovation, Care, Compassion, and Merit, braving enormous energy commitment and adversity.  </p>\n\n<p>After discontinuing the Non-Profit Organization Alternative Pathway Program Foundation, Alexander Rai had a stint of Collegiate and University Scholarship and Grant centered Projects and Activities where he attempted to ford the equally paralyzed bureaucracy of Academia to harness Transformational Equity.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, archiving a Wealth of Lessons imbibed on Human Nature and affirming by Deed the Words of numerous Men of Letters and Futurists, he steadily endeavored onwards to Serially Establish Start Ups across The City of Philadelphia where he had then moved, as well as beginning ambitious International Projects, Alliances, and Transformational Systems, including the creation of an Innovation Eco-Commune Center under the Brand of &#8216;Philadelphia Estates&#8217;, designed as a World Class, multi-conduited REIT Fund. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;He is a master of the unexpected connection, capable of envisioning and elevating hyperlinkage to a quantum level of communication&#8221; attributed the retired Disney Inc. accounts Manager Michael Bonifer, who is now bootstrapping his project &#8216;GameChangersLLC&#8217; in Los Angeles. </p>\n\n<p>Bonifer was an early bird Beneficiary and Participant of the Alignments contoured by Alexander directed towards Transformational Aims, and testified in writing in recognition of his own lucrative and original admissions into a circle of Transformational Movers and Shakers previously beyond the scope of his Independent Nouveau-Consulting Firm. </p>\n\n<p>Bonifer&#8217;s niece Chelsie Bonifer enjoyed much of the Generosity attributed to Alexander at the time, and spent Six Weeks under his Pro-Bono tutelage by the Disney Account Executive&#8217;s recommendation, - a Span of Mentorship, that transformed the failed Artist into an experienced Entrepreneur sending her back with an Improved Awareness of Systems, and landing her within the third week of the Charitable Project an Employment with America&#8217;s largest Conscious/Green Food Distribution House : Whole Foods, in Philadelphia. </p>\n\n<p>Alexander Rai has been solicited and retained by North American Pro Bono Associations seeking Entrepreneurial Mentors, and have actively curated the development on the Model of Inherent Giftedness and Ethical Education the seeded Propensity to Excel germane in the Young &#8212; lamentably discharged far too often self-inclusive in the terminal brackets of the Old.  </p>\n\n<p>Anne Marie Tobias, a Senior Silicon Valley Colleague and Software Architect/Programmer with backgrounds in early day Apple Inc., and latter day Valley Mid-Sized Boutique Enterprise establishments such as eFrontier, testified publicly in a Testimonial in 2009, </p>\n\n<p>â€œAlexander is a brash visionary. A man on a mission to alter the world and it&#8217;s people through advance in technology, fair access to the necessities of life, and social transformation. In this area he is peerless. He works with burning focus to create business ventures designed and engineered to inter-operate and fulfill his dream of a world that works for everyone. In his early twenties, Alex has already attained many of the marks of distinction that normally come to business men in the third and forth decade of successful business&#8230;/ All of this however pales in the face of Alexander&#8217;s profound generosity, compassion, and commitment to raising humanity to its highest possible self expression. Alexander is a rare man indeed, make the effort to get past his verbal flourish (he is ever in the midst of his passionate love affair with language), and you will be rewarded with an extraordinary intellect, a profound spirit, and a remarkable contribution to the dignity of the human spirit. I endorse Alexander with all my heart.â€  August 31, 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Alexander presently frequents in Europe and the Near East/South East Asia, and with a strong Expert Portfolio of &#8216;Real Life&#8217; encounters, enterprise, and affirmative positive, humanitarian vision, continues to perform Mission Building Initiatives in working with allies in Ecologically Focused, Conscious,  and &#8216;Green&#8217; Enterprises to build a Framework of Values that can become Open Source, Shared, and Tangible Servitors of the Profound Human Potential. </p>\n\n<p>In attributed and actual commentary he has demonstrated a Desire to &#8230; &#8220;Serve the World as a Holistic Designer, as indeed, all Life is Design, and Good Design is distinguished first by Intent and improved as a Craft &#8212; then too only by Intent. It is the Art of Positive Intention, with which Designing must bring about a Transformation of the Common, the Creative Collective, and render the State of Human-ness more amenable to the Excellence that it should no longer predicate to senselessly disserve!&#8221; ( Alexander Rai ) </p>\n\n<p>His main Interests are earmarked along the alignments of Human Health Consciousness, the Priorities of Ecology and related Policy, Energy Efficiency, Quantum Standards, and an introduction of Humanity into Space Age Awareness through Empowerment of the Universal Human Potential and Magnitude. He utilizes the term &#8216;CON-CATENATED&#8217; to define his Various Enterprises and Missions, and believes the Futures to be born will be increasingly shaped by Harmony rather than Noise, and asks to be considered as a &#8220;Servitor of that Future, where no one&#8217;s Potential is squandered to satisfy the Vices, Vitriol, and Vanity of those too blind to recognize the greater beauty of it all!&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO of Global Energy Efficiency Group testified in writing: â€œAlexander is one of the most talented and exceptionally intelligent people I have had the privilege of knowing and working with. He has superb organizational and delegating skills coupled with an unending drive of oneness and completeness of any and all projects and entrepreneur ventures he comes in contact with either through direct involvement or subtle but firm oversight. He has a brilliant outlook and has a far reaching vision for success. Through his entrepreneurship, he is devoted to making a positive difference for Mankind. I am proud to have him as a colleague and a friend.â€ July 20, 2009</p>\n\n<p>While the Public Sector Expert from World Bank testified â€œAlexander is an early awakener in terms of innovation, professional creativity and drive to accomplish any significant progress in the enterprises he chooses to get involved in. He has a very stimulant combination of vision and passion in everything he does, and this is naturally transformed into a deep-rooted leadership and enthusiastic engagement by his peers and coworkers.
