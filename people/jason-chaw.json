His research interests include question answering, knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language processing, and machine learning. Dr. Chaw was a key contributor to the Halo and Machine reading projects. His dissertation studied methods at addressing the problem faced by users in using unfamiliar knowledge bases to answer questions. During this time, he built the ASKME research prototype, which is an integral component to support question-answering in Project Halo. External evaluations have shown the work to make significant progress towards helping users use unfamiliar knowledge bases to answer questions.</p>\n\n<p>After graduation, Dr. Chaw joined IBM Research to work on extending the capabilities of the Watson question-answering system. He contributed to a computational resource of common sense knowledge to help Watson answer questions. In particular, Dr. Chaw investigated methods that learn to extract knowledge from text, a key requirement for the Watson system. Recently, the Watson system was showcased on national television by competing as a contestant on the Jeopardy! game-show. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"National University of Singapore","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Ph.D.","subject":"Computer Sciences","institution":"University of Texas at Austin","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Computer Scientist","firm":{"name":"JP Morgan Securities LLC","permalink":"jp-morgan-securities-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Computer Scientist","firm":{"name":"Accenture Technology Labs","permalink":"accenture-technology-labs","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Researcher","firm":{"name":"IBM Research","permalink":"ibm-research","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jchaw","title":""}]}
