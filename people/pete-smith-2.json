He also has a medical education company MedicalMediaKits.com which produces teaching media for health education and has several employees. His projects have won several international awards.</p>\n\n<p>With his background in molecular immunology, Professor Smith was approached in early 2007 to participate in a project to create evidence based skin care with allmedic (allmedic.org.au). The aim of this like-minded group of doctors to create simple, cost effective skin care treatment with evidence based ingredients which are used at demonstrated efficacy, and created in a pharmaceutical environment, and with a minimal of ingredients which are likely to complicate things and cause reactions.</p>\n\n<p>He is researching the use of photodynamic therapy where a compound called ALA is taken up into metabolically active (generally abnormal cells) in the skin and in the presence of light frequencies, abnormal cells are destroyed. This is being used in the US for field changes with several types of skin anomalies including superficial forms of skin cancer (not melanoma) although it is also used for skin rejuvenation. Through Allmedic, Associate Professor Smith is working on reducing pain associated with skin inflammation with PDT and he is going to be working towards skin pain with dermatitis in the next couple of year.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[135,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/8256/68256v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[225,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/8256/68256v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[296,328],"assets/images/resized/0006/8256/68256v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MB BS","subject":"Medicine","institution":"University of Tasmania","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"Immunology","institution":"Flinders University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Medical Director","firm":{"name":"allmedic","permalink":"allmedic","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,64],"assets/images/resized/0005/7838/57838v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,107],"assets/images/resized/0005/7838/57838v2-max-250x250.png"],[[350,151],"assets/images/resized/0005/7838/57838v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Medical Director","firm":{"name":"MedicalPix","permalink":"medicapix","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0006/9734/69734v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,78],"assets/images/resized/0006/9734/69734v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,141],"assets/images/resized/0006/9734/69734v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Medical Director","firm":{"name":"Medical Media Kits","permalink":"medical-media-kits","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0006/9837/69837v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0006/9837/69837v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[394,82],"assets/images/resized/0006/9837/69837v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.allmedic.org.au/allmedic-team.html","title":"allmedic profile"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://au.linkedin.com/pub/pete-smith/3/a49/744","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://healthengine.com.au/dr/PeteSmith","title":"HealthEngine"}]}
