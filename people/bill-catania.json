This Internet-based motor sports marketing venture was started while he was in college and rapidly grew to become one of the nationâ€™s premier online motorsports informational sites. While at RaceFan, Bill identified and negotiated the purchase of several major .com properties, which he then leveraged into one property, RaceFan.com. He turned RaceFan.com into a major news syndication service, serving the needs of Fox Sports, PRIMEDIA, NASCAR.com and several regional motorsports publishers. He is a graduate of Cornell University, where he earned and retained a â€œCornell Tradition Fellowship Scholarshipâ€ for a period of four years.
