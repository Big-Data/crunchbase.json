Together they wanted to share their innovative vision of user experience with the French market. </p>\n\n<p>As the Chief Operating Officer of Nealite, Greg is responsible for the development of the activity, the relations with the agencyâ€™s major clients (SFR, APEC, AllocinÃ©, â€¦), the recruitment and management of teams. </p>\n\n<p>How does one get to that point ??</p>\n\n<p>After writing a visionary thesis (â€œThe market of research portals on the Internetâ€ at the Business School of Nancy), Greg started as a Marketing and Business Manager at Nomade.fr, the very first francophone research web portal. He increased the website&#8217;s visibility by creating networks of influent journalists and students and then launched advertising campaigns for Compaq, Canon and Peugeot â€“ the first French companies that believed in the Webâ€™s ability to generate new traffic and bring new customers. </p>\n\n<p>Eager to avoid wearing camouflage clothes during an unwanted military service, Greg then left for Belgium where he developed the Nomade start-up in the Benelux. </p>\n\n<p>When he returned to Paris in 1999, Greg became the Head of the editorial team of Nomade and flipped the website into an actual portal by implementing new services (stock, weather, mail, news, â€œcharmâ€, forums, chat, horoscope, and other procrastinating tools) into it, thus responding to the userâ€™s needs. Greg got promoted Head of Media Projects when Liberty Surf â€“ followed by Tiscali â€“ bought Nomade, and went on launching new services simultaneously on all of the groupâ€™s websites (community services, shopping tools, video, personal pages, â€¦</p>\n\n<p>Apart from these great things, what are Gregâ€™s hobbies and what is his lifestyle?</p>\n\n<p>When he is not working, Greg likes (very) French food and contemporary art. He founded the Beef Tongue Appreciation Society on Facebook (44 involved and passionate members) and crafted his own Google Maps itinerary of the best art galleries in the Marais, where he enjoys taking his little daughter during the weekend.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/0488/40488v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,240],"assets/images/resized/0004/0488/40488v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,240],"assets/images/resized/0004/0488/40488v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Greg Wolf / [Nealite]</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"French Business School","subject":"Majoring in \"SystÃ¨mes d'Information & Organisation (SIO)\"","institution":"Institut Commercial de Nancy (ICN)","graduated_year":1997,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder & COO","firm":{"name":"Nealite","permalink":"nealite","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,34],"assets/images/resized/0002/4880/24880v2-max-150x150.png"],[[75,34],"assets/images/resized/0002/4880/24880v2-max-250x250.png"],[[75,34],"assets/images/resized/0002/4880/24880v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/gwolf","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/gregwolf","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
