Let us come in and train your staff how to use, and be proficient in Excel, Power Point, Word, CRM software like Brio, Cognos, Microsoft Dynamic or statistical tools like SPSS and SAS, Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft BI (SSAS, SSIS, SSRS)â€¦etc or we can set you up with an automated report that you can generate yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Segmentation, datamining and analysis can point out in seconds what you would look at for hours and not see. Efficiently and accurately look at your bottom line and make changes while others are still sorting their results.</p>\n\n<p>What makes us think we can teach anyone anything?</p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you a little more about our owner, Carla Gentry aka data_nerd.</p>\n\n<p>Being a single mother of two sons was a challenge but no one has ever accused Carla of backing down from a challenge, eager to learn and grow, she entered the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in the spring of 1993. Carla worked in the Developmental Math Lab her entire tenure with UTC, assisting students with all levels of mathematics. Upon graduating from UTC with a double major, Applied Mathematics and Economics in 1998, Carla moved to the Chicago area to start her career in analytics. During the past 14 years, she has worked with Fortune 100 and 500 companies including but not limited to, Discover Financial Services, J&amp;J, Hershey, Kraft, Kelloggâ€™s, SCJ, McNeil and Firestone. Acting as a liaison between the IT department and the Executive staff, she is able to take huge complicated databases, decipher business needs and come back with intelligence that quantifies spending, profit and trends.</p>\n\n<p>Being called a data nerd is a badge of courage for this curious Mathematician/Economist because knowledge is power and companies are now acknowledging its importance.</p>\n\n<p>Carla returned home to Chattanooga in 2008 bringing with her extensive knowledge of marketing, trends and database analysis. When not trying to solve the worldâ€™s problems, she enjoys Golf, playing with her 2 year old grandson, tutoring high school and college students in mathematics and beating her big sister at anything!</p>\n\n<p>More skills and recommendations at www.skillpages.com/carla.gentry and http://www.linkedin.com/in/datanerd13</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/4013/164013v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,220],"assets/images/resized/0016/4013/164013v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,220],"assets/images/resized/0016/4013/164013v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Mathematics","institution":"University of Tennessee","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Economics","institution":"University of Tennessee","graduated_year":1998,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Analytical Solution","permalink":"analytical-solution","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://analytical-solution.com/2011/10/13/how-do-you-become-a-data-scientist/","title":"How to become a Data Scientist"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://analytical-solution.com/about-us/","title":"About Us"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/datanerd13","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/data_nerd","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Analytical.Solution","title":"Facebook Biz Page"},{"external_url":"http://www.skillpages.com/carla.gentry","title":"Skillpages"}]}
