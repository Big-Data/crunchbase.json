Such was the case with the boomerang-shaped prosthesis Cheetah Flex-FootÂ® by Ossur. Worn by Ossur Americas-sponsored, history-making, bilateral amputee Oscar Pistorius from South Africa, Eythor and his team helped him win the right to compete in the Olympics. Today the Cheetah Flex-Foot is the prosthesis used by nearly every medalist at the Paralympics.</p>\n\n<p>As president of Ossur Americas â€“ a division heâ€™d grown from the United States and Canada to one spanning the Western Hemisphere â€“ Eythor introduced the first three bionic devices in the world for lower-limb amputees: the Rheo KneeÂ®, the Power Kneeâ„¢ and the Proprio Footâ„¢, intelligent prosthetic apparatus of choice used by war veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Eythor was the CEO of Rex Bionics. Prior to that, Eythor spent 13 years in executive management with Ossur, a global leader in the development, manufacture and distribution of non-invasive orthopedic products, serving the last six years as president of Ossur Americas. A driving force in the companyâ€™s unprecedented growth, during his tenure, the company mushroomed from a $3 million niche business to a $380 million international market leader with a global distribution network. In just three years and under his direction as president, sales for the division quadrupled. Eythor shaped the companyâ€™s strategies from a variety of perspectives, and was heavily involved in award-winning bionic product innovation, global business development, sales and marketing, 13 strategic acquisitions, and their IPO in 1999.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Ossur, Eythor worked for Hewlett Packard in Europe as Product Manager for both the Medical and the Computer Peripheral divisions.</p>\n\n<p>Eythor has a Masters in Business and Economics from Eberhard-Karls University, TÃ¼bingen, Germany. He is fluent in German, Icelandic and English.</p>\n\n<p>He is an active member of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO) and an ardent heliskiier. He is the father of 4 children and is married to France Westlund Bender.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/1658/111658v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/1658/111658v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[345,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/1658/111658v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Master","subject":"Economics / Business","institution":"University Tubingen Germany","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Ekso Bionics","permalink":"berkeley-bionics","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,38],"assets/images/resized/0011/1605/111605v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,63],"assets/images/resized/0011/1605/111605v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[360,92],"assets/images/resized/0011/1605/111605v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","firm":{"name":"Kerecis","permalink":"kerecis","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0011/9107/119107v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0011/9107/119107v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0011/9107/119107v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Rex Bionics","permalink":"rex-bionics","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Ossur","permalink":"ossur","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BLnOPA7oMxY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>TED2011 - Demos human exoskeletons</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VgaRfwvi-EE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>eLEGS exoskeleton on CNN with Ali Velshi</p>"},{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/b_mUQ7QZaes\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>Breaking News Videos from CNN.com - Bionic device for wheelchair users</p>"}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.wired.com/video/berkeley-bionics-elegs-help-paraplegics-walk/628164622001","title":"Wired Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://www.oandp.com/articles/news_2010-10-07_01.asp","title":"OandP Business News"},{"external_url":"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ossur-77136-technology-prosthetic.html?pic=1","title":"Technology with legs - OCRegister"},{"external_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2010/10/04/daily53.html","title":"Introduction eLEGS - San Francisco Business Journal 10/2010"},{"external_url":"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/09/health/he-amputee9/7","title":"Science Quickens it's steps - LA Times 03/2006"},{"external_url":"http://www.tedxsanantonio.com/speakers/2010-speaker-lineup/eythor-bender/","title":"TEDx San Antonio Oct "},{"external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/04/walking-with-robots-a-look-inside-exciting-new-technology-from-berkeley-bionics-tctv/","title":"Techcrunch May 4th 2011"},{"external_url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/67944770/","title":"Bloomberg interview March 23, 2011"},{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204346104576639063324567764.html","title":"Wall Street Journal October 2011"},{"external_url":"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/walking-again-with-help-from-an-exoskeleton/","title":"New York Times 4th of Nov 2011"},{"external_url":"http://news.sky.com/home/technology/article/16093536","title":"Sky News Oct. 27th 2011"},{"external_url":"http://www.theengineer.co.uk/sectors/medical-and-healthcare/news/us-researchers-create-suit-that-can-enable-paraplegics-to-walk/1010691.article","title":"The Engineer Oct. 2011"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/164/ekso-bionics","title":"Fast Company March 2012"},{"external_url":"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/164/ekso-bionics","title":"Fast Company March 2012"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/eythorbender","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
