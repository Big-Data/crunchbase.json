During his 4-year tenure he took the search engine through several firsts (very fast scalable Web crawler, support for many languages), while his colleague Mike Burrows (now at Google) built the first scalable search back-end. Louis also launched BabelFish, the first machine translation site.</p>\n\n<p>Louis got a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, in 1980. </p>\n\n<p>After several years in research at Carnegie-Mellon, XEROX P.A.R.C. and Digital Western Research Lab, he devoted four years to AltaVista. </p>\n\n<p>He was then the CTO and VP of Engineering for a Kleiner-backed start-up in the Internet barter space (BigVine). </p>\n\n<p>After taking a year off he joined <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ebay\" title=\"eBay\">eBay</a> as head of the Advanced Technology Group (the precursor to eBay Labs) and eBay&#8217;s first Technical Fellow. While at eBay he rewrote the search back-end, enabling it to be both scalable and to support near-real-time updates, saving eBay billions in operational costs.</p>\n\n<p>Louis then spent two years at <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> where he led the design of a faceted search engine, widely used for internal applications.</p>\n\n<p>He was then the VP of Products for <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cuil\" title=\"Cuil\">Cuil</a>, that he left in September 2008, citing differences with the CEO.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2009 Louis joined <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/doug-imbruce\" title=\"Doug Imbruce\">Doug Imbruce</a> as Founder and CTO of Qwiki.
