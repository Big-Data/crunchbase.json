In the mid 1980s Barrett founded various technology and software companies. In 1987, Barrett joined Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) as the Southeastern U.S. Sales Representative. SDRC specialized in CAD/CAM/CAE and PDM software and services.</p>\n\n<p>In 1995, Barrett was recruited by Hewlett-Packard and became the Eastern U.S. and Canadian Territory Manager for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Mechanical Design Division. Barrett was responsible for software and consulting in both direct and indirect channels throughout the East Coast and Canada. Barrett was instrumental in HP&#8217;s win at a large Canadian communications company and numerous engagements throughout the U.S. and Europe.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s Barrett became involved in a number of venture funded startups as a Business Development executive. Barrett leveraged his knowledge and contacts to form strategic partnerships with companies like HP and IBM. Then in 1998, Barrett was recruited by IBM and joined the newly formed National e-Business Practice as a Senior Consultant and Principal. Formed as a response to the ever growing influence of the Web in business, the organization was responsible for oversight and direction of IBM&#8217;s Internet Market Strategy both Nationally and abroad for IBM&#8217;s largest clients.</p>\n\n<p>Barrett left IBM after a successful career to once again be part of a funded startup where Barrett was Senior Vice President of Business Development.

Barrett grew the company from 4 agents to over 30 and two offices in less than 2 years. In early 2010, Barrett merged the company with another regional firm and Barrett stepped down as President of his company.</p>\n\n<p>During the same time, Barrett developed a number of technologies for the real-estate industry.
