He joined Yahoo! via the acquisition of Bix, where he was a founding engineer. His work prior to Yahoo! focused on developing distributed platforms for real-time interpersonal interaction in a variety of areas including entertainment, medicine, psychology, and defense. During this time, he became interested in the underlying architecture of reliable distributed systems, particularly those built from unreliable components. His diverse experiences have led him to develop new approaches to make today&#8217;s increasingly complex distributed systems more reliable. John holds a degree in Computer and Systems Engineering from Guelph University in Ontario, Canada.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[90,129],"assets/images/resized/0015/0332/150332v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[90,129],"assets/images/resized/0015/0332/150332v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[90,129],"assets/images/resized/0015/0332/150332v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Degree ","subject":"Computer and Systems Engineering","institution":"Guelph University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and Chief Architect ","firm":{"name":"Pure Storage","permalink":"pure-storage","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0010/5732/105732v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0010/5732/105732v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0010/5732/105732v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
