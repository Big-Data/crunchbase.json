The MyMuzik Stand allows for hands-free page turning, touchscreen annotations, storage of sheet music, and provides access to thousands of scores that can be downloaded directly to the stand from their website. </p>\n\n<p>Some enterprising souls use an iPad, which is slick but too small to comfortably read an 8.5x11&#8221; score without scrolling or squinting. The MyMuzik Stand is the same size as 2 full pages of sheet music, and Robert strives to revolutionize the music industry with his innovative product. </p>\n\n<p>As a young, growing start-up, short term cash was tight, so Robert came up with an alternative solution to accelerate his software development. His event, Hacking-4-Muzik, was a 54 hour coding marathon that attracted the nation&#8217;s top software developers, graphic designers, and techie musicans who all showed up to integrate music with technology. </p>\n\n<p>Robert and the MyMuzik stand have been recognized in Entrepreneur Magazine, MSNBC, Bloomberg Business Week, and many more. They were also recently a top 10 semi-finalist in New York State&#8217;s Creative Core emerging business competition.</p>\n\n<p>Video of Robert playing his piano improvisation</p>\n\n<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sjPe6u8xJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0019/6036/196036v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,135],"assets/images/resized/0019/6036/196036v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,244],"assets/images/resized/0019/6036/196036v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/222656","title":"Entrepreneur Magazine"},{"external_url":"http://www.cnybj.com/Channels/Technology/tabid/73/itemid/16064/sourcemid/417/Tech-Garden-startup-iMuzik-targets-launch-this-year/Default.aspx?returnUrl=%2FChannels%2FTechnology.aspx#.T0-OqIhVx4c.facebook","title":"CNY Business Journal"},{"external_url":"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/markets/news/article.asp?docKey=600-201205181219KRTRIB__BUSNEWS_47781_20687-1&params=timestamp%7C%7C05%2F18%2F2012+12%3A19+PM+ET%7C%7Cheadline%7C%7CVenture+Forum+aids+first+impressions+[The+Buffalo+News%2C+N.Y.]%","title":"Bloomberg Business Week"},{"external_url":"http://www.indiegogo.com/Hacking-4-Muzik-Digital-Music-Stand?c=home","title":"IndieGogo Campaign"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/robert.janduracessna","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/#!/janduracessna","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-jandura-cessna/37/137/1a1","title":"Linkedin"}]}
