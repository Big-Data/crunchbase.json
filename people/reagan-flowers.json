She has implemented a model that integrates learning, holds teachers accountable, develops teacher content knowledge, exposes students to STEM competition, creates STEM education pipelines (feeder patterns), and connects classroom learning to the workforce. </p>\n\n<p>In closing, Dr. Flowers continues to focus her outreach efforts in areas that assist schools in providing life changing STEM experiences for teachers and students.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Biology","institution":"Texas Southern University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Graduate","subject":"Counseling","institution":"Prairie View A&M University of Texas","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"PhD","subject":"Education Leadership","institution":"Union Institute and University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"CSTEM","permalink":"cstem","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"CSTEM","permalink":"cstem","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://carlafair-wright.blogspot.com/2009/11/interview-with-dr-reagan-d-flowers.html","title":"Technological Women"},{"external_url":"http://www.wise-qatar.org/content/reagan-flowers","title":"World Innovation Summit for Education"},{"external_url":"http://blog.chron.com/kuffsworld/2012/01/interview-with-reagan-flowers/","title":"Chron.com Interview"},{"external_url":"http://www.globalnewenergysummit.org/speakers/reagan-flowers/","title":"Global New Energy Summit"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUp6uqIZ7WY","title":"CSTEM on Great Day Houston"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://cstem.org","title":"CSTEM"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/cstemorg","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/cstem.org","title":"Facebook"}]}
