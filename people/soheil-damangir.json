During his study he worked on dynamics of machinery and robot design using optimization methods. His contribution was developing a method for optimum design of mechanism with minimal computation cost by combining optimization methods and mechanical concepts. Later his research interests shifted to artificial intelligence and its applications in natural language processing and image processing. These interests are rooted in his work experience mostly in designing and implementing vertical natural language search engine and image categorization. These works led him to join to the R&amp;D department of iKnowlej Corp on 2007, where he has been working on image and video selection for news articles. Recently he joined a research team working on a web-scale face image search in the computer science and communication department of the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[140,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/3963/53963v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[233,250],"assets/images/resized/0005/3963/53963v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[336,360],"assets/images/resized/0005/3963/53963v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Research and Development Manager, CTO","firm":{"name":"iKnowlej","permalink":"iknowlej","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/7111/17111v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/7111/17111v1-max-250x250.png"],[[288,88],"assets/images/resized/0001/7111/17111v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
