He quickly learned the business and opened an E-commerce store of his own, primarily selling high definition plasma tvs. At Highdefonline.com Gil produced 20 million in annual sales and went on to open several more successful internet stores. Taking a cue from companies like Mcafee and Hackersafe Gil wanted to produce a badge for merchant websites that will truly make shopping online a lot easier and simpler for their prospective customers. At that time, a lot of websites like Yahoo shopping, Resellerratings and others began to allow customers to post reviews and ratings of stores they have done business with online. Gil saw an opportunity to provide shoppers with pertinent information that they normally would leave the merchants websites to seek out. Together with his programmer brother, Gil created a program that searched for and then displays reviews of participating merchants directly on their websites for their customers to read before making their purchase decisions. </p>\n\n<p>Reviewspotter is now trusted by over 20 million people a month for incite as to the reputation and business practices of over 350 etail merchants primarily in the US but also worldwide. </p>\n\n<p>Most current project is www.Pressrate,com, a non-profit, user governed and contributor owned news aggregator/collaborative.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,123],"assets/images/resized/0012/9942/129942v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,123],"assets/images/resized/0012/9942/129942v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,123],"assets/images/resized/0012/9942/129942v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Ba","subject":"Marketing","institution":"Brooklyn College","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief contributor","firm":{"name":"www.Pressrate.com","permalink":"www-pressrate-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.Reviewspotter.com","title":"Reviewspotter"}]}
