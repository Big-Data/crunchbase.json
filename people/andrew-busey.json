He most recently co-founded Pluck which enables social media on major sites such as TheStreet.com, USA Today, and Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>But his passion has always been gaming. In 2006 Andrew decided the time was right to pursue his dream and Challenge Games was born. Challenge Games launched their first game Duels in August 2007.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, Andrew led, developed, and contributed to numerous &#8220;Multi-User Dungeon&#8221; or &#8220;Multi-User Domain&#8221; (MUDs) games, which were the early predecessors to games like World of Warcraft and Everquest. In 1994, he wrote Secrets of the MUD Wizards, the first major published book on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew holds seven technology patents and has several others pending. He is a graduate in computer science from Duke University and holds an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[98,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/1406/21406v1-max-150x150.png"],[[139,212],"assets/images/resized/0002/1406/21406v1-max-250x250.png"],[[139,212],"assets/images/resized/0002/1406/21406v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.challengegames.com/people.html\" title=\"Challenge Games\" rel=\"nofollow\">Challenge Games</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Duke University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"The Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"Challenge Games","permalink":"challenge-games","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0000/2860/2860v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/2860/2860v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[166,133],"assets/images/resized/0000/2860/2860v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Mentor","firm":{"name":"Capital Factory","permalink":"capital-factory","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0003/9515/39515v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9515/39515v2-max-250x250.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0003/9515/39515v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Umbel","permalink":"umbel","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[364,364],"assets/images/resized/0015/0546/150546v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Living.com","permalink":"living-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Pluck","permalink":"pluck","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/4456/14456v1-max-150x150.png"],[[228,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/4456/14456v1-max-250x250.png"],[[228,64],"assets/images/resized/0001/4456/14456v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"iChat","permalink":"ichat","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Plerts","permalink":"plerts","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0008/3638/83638v1-max-150x150.png"],[[227,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/3638/83638v1-max-250x250.png"],[[227,73],"assets/images/resized/0008/3638/83638v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://andrewbusey.com","title":"Personal Blog"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/andrewbusey","title":"Twitter"}]}
