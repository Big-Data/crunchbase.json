He soon found himself touching many pieces of the business, from marketing to sales and business development, and helped build Away into the webâ€™s largest travel publisher, a top brand in the adventure travel space, and a successful media business. </p>\n\n<p>After an acquisition by Orbitz, Josh held a leadership role in media sales and business development for the Partner Marketing group within Cendant. </p>\n\n<p>On a personal level, Josh is an avid traveler who loves the outdoors. When he&#8217;s not scheming about his next trip to Mongolia or Bolivia, he&#8217;s taking advantage of Northern California&#8217;s abundant outdoor adventure opportunities, whether it&#8217;s snowboarding in Tahoe, mountain biking in Sonoma, hiking in Big Sur or kayaking in Sausalito. Josh is a graduate of Princeton, and tries not to bore his friends with stories from college too often, though he sometimes canâ€™t help himself.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[126,144],"assets/images/resized/0001/7739/17739v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[126,144],"assets/images/resized/0001/7739/17739v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[126,144],"assets/images/resized/0001/7739/17739v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder, CEO","firm":{"name":"NileGuide","permalink":"nile-guide","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0001/7738/17738v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0001/7738/17738v5-max-250x250.png"],[[346,103],"assets/images/resized/0001/7738/17738v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CRO & EVP Business Development","firm":{"name":"Travora Media","permalink":"travel-ad-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0001/7473/17473v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,76],"assets/images/resized/0001/7473/17473v5-max-250x250.png"],[[340,104],"assets/images/resized/0001/7473/17473v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
