By focusing on these specific industries we have built close relationships with many of the top companies in the industry and have established an extensive network of direct sales contacts. Headquartered in Fall River, MA the company is located in close proximity to many major facilities in the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Our company believes in fully understanding our clientâ€™s needs and expectations from the very beginning. It is our goal to have the same definition of success as our clients and to formulate the best strategies on how we are going to achieve our mutual goals. It all starts by assigning individuals to manage the sale of your equipment that have the necessary experience and knowledge to execute on the highest level. We pride ourselves on detailed communication and educating our clients on our processes and strategies. We work with our clients to design and implement programs that are systematic and streamlined in order to meet their expectations and guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Surplus Solutions offers several different services to our clients to help get their equipment sold. These services include brokerage, consignment, auction services and outright cash purchases. We tailor these services to meet the individual needs of our clients and design a specialized solution that will help them realize the maximum return for their surplus equipment.</p>\n\n<p>At Surplus Solutions we pride ourselves on our intensive targeted marketing campaigns. All of our solutions depend heavily on our marketing initiatives to get the equipment sold for the best price in a reasonable amount of time. Without effective marketing, equipment can stay on the market for several years and never sell or sell for substantially less than the equipment is worth. We individually list available equipment on our website, with detailed specifications and actual pictures of every piece of equipment. The company then begins target marketing of the equipment though our extensive customer databases. We also engage in email solicitation, online marketing and phone based selling techniques to realize the greatest return on the equipment as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Surplus Solutions would like to be your one-stop equipment broker for everything from one-off equipment sales to entire plant liquidations. Please contact Surplus Solutions today to find out more details on the specialized solutions we can provide you in the asset management of your equipment.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.ssllc.com","title":"Surplus Solutions LLC"}]}
