He further sharpened his technical teeth while living abroad in London and Sydney, where he built high performance, high availability financial servers that moved billions daily. His experience leading development teams from around the world has given him an appreciation of the diversity of human behavior and he often finds the best solutions start from listening. Following various stints in education, finance, and travel startups, he founded his own consulting business to provide advisory services and coding solutions for startups. Juan studied computer science and studio art at Dartmouth College, has visited over 50 countries, thinks machine learning and swarm algorithms are awesome, and occasionally slips into a ridiculous faux British accent. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0020/6071/206071v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0020/6071/206071v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0020/6071/206071v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/juan-vasquez/16/42/373\" title=\"Juan Vasquez on LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juan Vasquez on LinkedIn</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":" Computer Science, Studio Art, Spanish Literature ","institution":"Dartmouth College","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Tastemaker","permalink":"tastemaker","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0020/6059/206059v1-max-150x150.png"],[[197,38],"assets/images/resized/0020/6059/206059v1-max-250x250.png"],[[197,38],"assets/images/resized/0020/6059/206059v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President","firm":{"name":"BlackRock","permalink":"blackrock","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/3488/23488v1-max-150x150.png"],[[138,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/3488/23488v1-max-250x250.png"],[[138,27],"assets/images/resized/0002/3488/23488v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/juan-vasquez/16/42/373","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
