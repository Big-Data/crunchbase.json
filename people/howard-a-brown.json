In 2004, he founded DemandResults based on his unique experience in evidence-based search marketing and behavioral targeting. His unique expertise blending marketing and technology have helped dozens of clients from Salesforce.com to Aspen Education Group implement a more measured approach to marketing their efforts, leading to improved ROI, increased revenue and better customer relationships. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to building DemandResults, Howard created 4Therapy.com, a powerful network of hundreds of healthcare information and referral sites, which won the eHealthcare Award for Best Use of the Internet in 2000. Howard later sold the company to CRC Health, a Bain Capital company, and went on to serve as the healthcare giant&#8217;s Vice President of Marketing. CRC Health CEO, Barry Karlin, called 4Therapy.com the company&#8217;s best overall acquisition. </p>\n\n<p>During Howard&#8217;s three years at CRC Health, the company&#8217;s online channel grew from just 1.5 percent of new business to over 26 percent. This segment now represents one of CRC Health&#8217;s largest channels and over 120,000 phone calls a year to the company&#8217;s National Resource Center. </p>\n\n<p>In January 2004, Howard founded another web-based company, Senior Transitions. Senior Transitions is the nation&#8217;s leading elder care referral service, and in the last few years has become a trusted partner and resource for over 4,000 senior assisted living facilities. </p>\n\n<p>In both 2007 and 2008, Howard was a finalist for the prestigious Salesforce Appy Award. In 2006, he was nominated for the Salesforce.com Best Force.com Native App Award for an advanced CRM application he built to test and measure sales and marketing efforts at CRC Health. Howard was also nominated for the Salesforce.com Collaboration Excellence award for Senior Transitions. His emergence as a leader in results-focused marketing techniques has made him a frequent panelist and presenter at a number of industry conferences.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,127],"assets/images/resized/0006/0230/60230v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[99,127],"assets/images/resized/0006/0230/60230v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[99,127],"assets/images/resized/0006/0230/60230v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"DemandResults","permalink":"demandresults","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0006/0229/60229v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0006/0229/60229v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,102],"assets/images/resized/0006/0229/60229v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"RingDNA, Inc.","permalink":"ringdna-inc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/technology/sequoia-capital-invests-appirio-accelerate-adoption-demand/","source_description":"Sequoia Capital Invests in Appirio to Accelerate the Adoption of On-Demand ","raised_amount":1100000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Appirio","permalink":"appirio","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0002/2442/22442v6-max-150x150.png"],[[184,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/2442/22442v6-max-250x250.png"],[[184,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/2442/22442v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[{"description":"Founded 4therapy.com Network to address the need to facilitate better contact between consumers and providers of mental health services, and to offer information and support services of genuine value to each.","stoned_year":1998,"stoned_month":12,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://www.4therapy.com/professional/about_us/item.php?uniqueid=194&categoryid=145&","source_text":null,"source_description":"4therapy.com NETWORK, Inc. was founded in 1998","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Howard","last_name":"A.
