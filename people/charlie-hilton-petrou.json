A simple formula, make a job for himself, and provide a hobby for many others. The company (Urban Times LTD) co-founder, Alexander Phillips, shared this philosophy and together they sculpted an ethos of Optimistic Forward-Thinking. </p>\n\n<p>As an Urban Planning, Design &amp; Management (BSc) and International Real Estate &amp; Planning (MSc) student, Charlie&#8217;s connection to the built environment is intrinsic. Hence, the primary scope of Urban Times, when it started, was planning, architecture, urban design and real estate. This scope widened fast as Charlie and Alexander met new and exciting writers through the site.</p>\n\n<p>Charlie also stands as Editor-in-Chief of URBNFUTR (http://urbnfutr.com/), which is one of many planned expansionary efforts by Urban Times. The sub-site focuses on the future, more specifically the future of cities, and attempts to delve into the core issues facing humanity as we move forward.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5485/155485v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5485/155485v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/5485/155485v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Urban Times","permalink":"urban-times","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/2394/152394v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/2394/152394v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0015/2394/152394v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
