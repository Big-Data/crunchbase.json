He has been working with some of the BranchOut team since 2003, previously at SuperFan and Tickle (acquired by Monster for over $100mm) before that. His experience working in start-up environments has allowed him the privilege to own many products from every stage of the product development flow â€“ from the idea stage to designing wireframes, mock-ups and prototypes; to delivering specs and managing the team of front-end and back-end engineers; to assessing and prioritizing project tasks; to QAing; launching live products; following through with analytic measurements and optimization; and iterating to maximize virality and revenue. Zack studied communication design and business at San Francisco State University. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/9967/99967v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[194,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/9967/99967v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[350,450],"assets/images/resized/0009/9967/99967v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts","subject":"Industrial Arts","institution":"San Francisco State University","graduated_year":2003,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Product Design","firm":{"name":"BranchOut","permalink":"branchout","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,61],"assets/images/resized/0018/5012/185012v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[149,61],"assets/images/resized/0018/5012/185012v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[149,61],"assets/images/resized/0018/5012/185012v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","firm":{"name":"Fanzy","permalink":"fanrank","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,65],"assets/images/resized/0014/6187/146187v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,108],"assets/images/resized/0014/6187/146187v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,195],"assets/images/resized/0014/6187/146187v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Product & Design","firm":{"name":"SuperFan","permalink":"superfan","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0005/0209/50209v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0005/0209/50209v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0005/0209/50209v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Associate Product Manager","firm":{"name":"Tickle","permalink":"tickle","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/8197/18197v1-max-150x150.png"],[[129,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/8197/18197v1-max-250x250.png"],[[129,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/8197/18197v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://onisko.com","title":"Portfolio"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/zack415","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/zack415","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/zack415","title":"Facebook"}]}
