Though now based in LiveWire&#8217;s San Francisco office, Adam hails from Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he honed his hunting and fishing skills before moving to California to attend Stanford University. After earning a Bachelors Degree from Stanford in Environmental Science, Adam accepted a position with Jones &amp; Stokes, an environmental consulting firm headquartered in Sacramento, California. During his tenure at Jones &amp; Stokes, Adam worked to develop innovative practices for the handling of waste in the state of California and establish sustainable wildlife preserves to accommodate native but threatened species.</p>\n\n<p>From there Adam set his sights on the electrical supply businesses. He saw in the industry tremendous potential to improve processes by moving them to the Internet and making them more environmentally sustainable. Adam started LiveWire Supply in late 2005 with these aims in mind. In just a few years, Adam has grown LiveWire to the Internet&#8217;s No. 1 electrical supply house and made tremendous strides in his efforts to green the electrical supply industry. In October 2008 and again in 2009, the State of California honored Adam and LiveWire&#8217;s efforts with a highly coveted &#8220;Best of California Waste Reduction&#8221; award. Other winners include Apple Inc., Chevron, Anheuser-Busch Inc., Chevron, Coca-Cola Inc. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E).</p>\n\n<p>Adam was captain of the men&#8217;s swimming team at Stanford University. He is an NCAA champion multiple times over, a Pan American Games Gold Medalist and an Olympic Games Trialist. In his spare time, Adam enjoys kiteboarding, surfing, camping and fishing trips to Kodiak, Alaska &#8211; as often as possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0011/9806/119806v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0011/9806/119806v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0011/9806/119806v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelors of Science","subject":"","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"LiveWire Supply","permalink":"livewire-supply","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.gostanford.com/sports/m-swim/mtt/messner_adam00.html","title":"Stanford Athletics"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.livewiresupply.com","title":"LiveWire Supply"}]}
