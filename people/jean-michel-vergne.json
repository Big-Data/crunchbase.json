My education background is Business Administration and Political Sciences. I started my career in Consulting and then HR Management at Air France.\nI moved to the software industry by joining CCMX, a French company where I helped launch a new offering of Human Resource management applications before being recruited by PeopleSoft, when the Californian software vendor decided to expand into Europe. From 1993 through 1999, as the first employee hired in France, I experienced a variety of jobs including product localisation, consulting and customer services, growing the subsidiary from a 2 employee organization to a major player in the HR and ERP arena. I then worked in customer services for Meta 4 before taking pan-European roles in e-business companies : i2 Technologies (supply chain management);  Blue Martini (e-commerce); Jobpartners (e-human capital management in software as a service mode).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/2780/22780v5-max-150x150.png"],[[158,206],"assets/images/resized/0002/2780/22780v5-max-250x250.png"],[[158,206],"assets/images/resized/0002/2780/22780v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":"<p>Jean-Michel / <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/uk/company/about-us/leadership-team\" title=\"blueKiwi\" rel=\"nofollow\">blueKiwi</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"VP European Operations","firm":{"name":"blueKiwi","permalink":"bluekiwi","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0000/1666/1666v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,77],"assets/images/resized/0000/1666/1666v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[275,85],"assets/images/resized/0000/1666/1666v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
