Major PC OEMs and AIBs including Dell, Sony and Turtle Beach made A3D the preeminent PC audio brand of the 1990s. Aureal was acquired by Creative Labs in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>After a stint operating his own venture-backed startup in the mobile platform space (which shipped product with the likes of Sega, HP and Nokia) â€“ Suneil joined AGEIA Technologies where he established the PhysX Processing Unit (PPU) as a PC hardware category. The PhysX engine was integral to 150+\ntitles including: Gears of War &amp; UT3 (Epic) and Splinter Cell &amp; GRAW titles (Ubisoft) with over twenty thousand registered developers; leading PPU customers included Dell, HP and ASUS. AGEIA was purchased by NVIDIA in early 2008 where Suneil spent time during the transition to make PhysX a core\nNVIDIA GPU product brand.</p>\n\n<p>From mid-2008 until early 2010, Suneil was VP of Sales &amp; Marketing, N. America for PrimeSense Inc, an Israeli-based, privately-held startup in the 3D-sensor space. In this role, Suneil drove all US operations including business development, sales and promotion. PrimeSenseâ€™s first public customer was\nannounced in April 2010 as Microsoft Corp, with PrimeSensor chip technology powering the Xbox360â€™s â€œKinect for Xbox360â€ controllerless gaming solution which revolutionized the console gaming and entertainment space and was the fastest selling consumer electronics device in history post-launch.</p>\n\n<p>Suneil has most recently leveraged his years of bringing game-changing and brand-leadership technologies to market - from audio to mobile, physics to 3D-motion-sensing across numerous consumer products segments - into a broad-based investment and consultancy role for a number of clients on a\nworldwide basis.</p>\n\n<p>Suneil holds an M.S. in Computer Science from the George Washington University with a specialization in Computer Animation, Multimedia Design and Virtual Reality, and a B.
