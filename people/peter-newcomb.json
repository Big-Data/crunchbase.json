Prior to founding OneRiot, Peter built a number of prototypes and production systems that have realized the benefits of the community-centric approach to software design. Peter served as a co-editor of ISO/IEC 10744:1992, which was a predecessor of todayâ€™s Web and XML hypermedia standards. Peter was also a key contributor to the Topic Map family of standards, a technology that focuses on the exchange and integration of human generated semantic indexes over bodies of information.  Peter spent many years designing and implementing SGML and XML-based standards and systems.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, Peter began working at Ecosystems alongside fellow OneRiot Founder Robert Reich, using implicitly captured data to increase the quantity and fidelity of interaction among people through computers. The work in this field led to the development of OneRiot, to build a socially driven, realtime search experience that brings â€œreal worldâ€ human interaction to the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Peter attended the University of Rochester, focusing on cognitive science and electrical engineering before leaving school to pursue his career in software design.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/6436/86436v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/6436/86436v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/6436/86436v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>lauriesmithphoto.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"OneRiot","permalink":"oneriot","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0001/1747/11747v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,46],"assets/images/resized/0001/1747/11747v6-max-250x250.png"],[[315,58],"assets/images/resized/0001/1747/11747v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
