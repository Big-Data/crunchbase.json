Early on, John was responsible for key innovations that bridged a dozen social-networks under a unified user-experience. Later, John evolved Zoosk’s infrastructure further by turning it into a platform-agnostic API, supporting Zoosk’s iPhone, Android, and Zoosk Messenger applications. This investment paid dividends when John hatched Project Cupid, a compiled Javascript front-end that transformed Zoosk’s website into a persistent, real-time social experience that pushes upon the boundaries of the web.</p>\n\n<p>Before starting Zoosk, John worked as a Program Manager for Microsoft’s Developer Division, managing several developer-focused initiatives such as MSDN Answers, Connect beta programs, and a Business Intelligence platform codenamed “Detego”. </p>\n\n<p>John graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,120],"assets/images/resized/0017/5622/175622v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,201],"assets/images/resized/0017/5622/175622v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,362],"assets/images/resized/0017/5622/175622v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Zoosk, Inc.</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"University of Texas","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Architect","firm":{"name":"Zoosk","permalink":"zoosk","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/0524/20524v5-max-150x150.png"],[[120,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/0524/20524v5-max-250x250.png"],[[120,60],"assets/images/resized/0002/0524/20524v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founding Engineer","firm":{"name":"Prescreen","permalink":"prescreen-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0015/1758/151758v3-max-150x150.png"],[[238,58],"assets/images/resized/0015/1758/151758v3-max-250x250.png"],[[238,58],"assets/images/resized/0015/1758/151758v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/#!/thesmart","title":"Twitter"}]}
