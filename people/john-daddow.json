Lived in the country town of Cooroy for 6.5 years before moving to the tourist mecca of Noosa. Did a bit of surfing, but was more into motorbikes, because they went faster. I&#8217;m a competitive type of person, and love things that go fast, and as such, I love my motorsport. I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of karting in my day.</p>\n\n<p>Became a mechanic doing my apprenticeship and working at my father&#8217;s Honda dealership in Cooroy, and then doing RACQ breakdown work in Noosa. Moved back to Brisbane in my early twenties to build a career in IT.</p>\n\n<p>Now have two boys, Michael and Tom, who bring me much joy, and help to keep me young.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0018/8076/188076v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0018/8076/188076v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0018/8076/188076v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","firm":{"name":"Constantech","permalink":"constantech","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://plus.google.com/109466070586865373737","title":"Google Plus"},{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Constantech","title":"Facebook"}]}
