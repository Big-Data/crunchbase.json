From a young age, she was interested in fashion and design and attempted multiple times to follow that course of study yet was restricted by family beliefs. Instead, she spent her formative years living and studying in the Middle East where she obtained her degree in engineering. Upon her return to the US, she continued a successful career in internet marketing and advertising. Within several years, she started to experience baffling health issues that Western medicine could not cure. Her desire to heal her mind-body connection without the help of pharmaceuticals brought her to yoga. During this time she found herself drawn to crystals, numerology, astrology, and jewelry design. As crystal healing played a significant role in Lubna&#8217;s own healing process, she wanted to share that with other women.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, Lubna has become a certified Kundalini Yoga instructor as well as a Reiki practitioner. Her spiritual name, Anantjeet - meaning eternally brave and victorious - describes her motivation to choose love over fear in the face of adversity. House of Shakti was born out of Lubna&#8217;s desire to express her love for spirituality, healing, yoga, poetry, storytelling, color, and fashion. Lubna hopes that the success of House of Shakti will allow her to bring these same healing modalities and philosophies to other women in need of healing their mind, body, and/or soul.</p>\n\n<p>Lubna currently resides in Los Angeles, CA.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[102,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9260/139260v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[171,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/9260/139260v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[298,435],"assets/images/resized/0013/9260/139260v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BSc","subject":"Computer Engineering","institution":"Amman Private University","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Teaching Certification","subject":"Kundalini Yoga","institution":"Yoga West LA","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner/Designer","firm":{"name":"House of Shakti, LLC","permalink":"house-of-shakti-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://arabnews.com/lifestyle/fashion/article381596.ece","title":"Lubna Salah: Jewelry with a Purpose"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/houseofshakti","title":"House of Shakti on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/lubna","title":"Lubna Salah on LinkedIn"}]}
