As a co-founder of DebtMarket, Inc, I successfully navigated the volatility of a startup, resulting in an acquisition by a leading global financial services organization.</p>\n\n<p>Formerly a whole loan portfolio analyst/associate at the PE fund ICM and sales manager at Brainpark, I have developed a unique combination of analytical skill, technical knowledge, and business development comprehension. I enjoy strategic planning and consider myself a well rounded professional with entrepreneurial ambition.</p>\n\n<p>I currently serve as a Sales Engineer at a publicly traded global financial services firm. I lead the technical sales efforts for whole loan trading products and services.</p>\n\n<p>I am able to continue a lifelong pursuit of generous giving as a member of the board of directors at the W Charitable Foundation. I have a penchant for sales and am an avid equities trader. In my downtime, you can find me skydiving, wakeboarding, mountain biking, snowboarding, or trying to combine a pair of those. I am also a Crossfit fanatic. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"DebtMarket","permalink":"global-debt-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,29],"assets/images/resized/0002/4588/24588v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/4588/24588v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,89],"assets/images/resized/0002/4588/24588v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Channel and Alliances Manager","firm":{"name":"Inktank","permalink":"inktank","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,43],"assets/images/resized/0019/1260/191260v3-max-150x150.png"],[[129,43],"assets/images/resized/0019/1260/191260v3-max-250x250.png"],[[129,43],"assets/images/resized/0019/1260/191260v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Sold DebtMarket to a Leading Global Financial Services Firm","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Walchek","permalink":"steven-walchek"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
