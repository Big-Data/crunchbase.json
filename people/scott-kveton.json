He is widely recognized as an expert on mobile app strategy and cloud infrastructure. He speaks frequently on app monetization, engagement and the developer ecosystems around the various mobile platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Under Kvetonâ€™s leadership, Urban Airship has added customers, employees and accolades at a rapid pace. The company powers some of the most successful brands in mobile, including ESPN, Tapulous, Groupon, dictionary.com, msnbc.com and Newsweek. Urban Airshipâ€™s flagship offeringsâ€”push notifications and in-app purchaseâ€”help apps gain success by increasing user engagement and delivering a path to monetization. As of March, the venture-backed start-up has delivered more than 3 billion push notifications across the Apple, Android and Blackberry platforms and enabled more than 3 million in-app mobile transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to co-founding Urban Airship, Kveton had more than a dozen years of experience building technology, developing business strategy and leading engineering teams with companies including Amazon.com, Rulespace, JanRain and Vidoop. He also co-founded the Open Source Lab (OSL) at Oregon State University.
