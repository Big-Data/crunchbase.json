Prior to joining Razorsight, Mr. Bednarski served as the senior vice president of business development at iDirect Technologies. He joined iDirect in April of 2002 in a board led effort to restructure the executive management team. Immediately upon arrival, Mr. Bednarski focused on recrafting iDirect&#8217;s business plan and correcting the balance sheet. Successful execution of the new plan propelled iDirect from a minor position in the broadband IP VSAT router industry to a leadership role in an extremely short period. During his tenure, iDirect grew revenues from a 2001 level of $1.5 million with sizeable losses to a run rate of over $112 million in 2006 with industry leading gross margin and net income percentage.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/4253/44253v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,160],"assets/images/resized/0004/4253/44253v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,160],"assets/images/resized/0004/4253/44253v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"Business Administration and an MBA","institution":"University of New Haven, Connecticut","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Senior Vice President, Business Development","firm":{"name":"Razorsight","permalink":"razorsight","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,42],"assets/images/resized/0004/4246/44246v1-max-150x150.png"],[[239,67],"assets/images/resized/0004/4246/44246v1-max-250x250.png"],[[239,67],"assets/images/resized/0004/4246/44246v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
