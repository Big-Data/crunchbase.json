Even though he enjoyed the technical development of products, somehow he missed not having the chance to be more creative in his job. That&#8217;s why he decided to leave and do something focused on the creative part rather than on the technical one.</p>\n\n<p>After two years working as a junior R+D Engineer for Altran, he decided to move somewhere else and get back to the university again. He moved to UmeÃ¥, in the very north of Sweden, where he is now currently studying and living, as he was accepted into the Interaction Design MA programme. </p>\n\n<p>He was an intern at the Designit office in Copenhagen for seven months and is currently working on his final degree project in collaboration with Spotify, which will be finished in February 2011.</p>\n\n<p>He now works at IDEO Chicago as an interaction designer. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/1743/121743v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0012/1743/121743v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,200],"assets/images/resized/0012/1743/121743v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
