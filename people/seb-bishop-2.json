(RED) has forged partnerships with some of the worldâ€™s most iconic brands, including American Express, Apple, Bugaboo, Converse, Dell, Shazam, Diptyque, Penguin Books, Emporio Armani, Gap, Nike, Penfolds, Belvedere and Starbucks - to create desirable (RED) branded products, with up to half the profits going to the Global Fund. Since 2006, (RED) has raised over $160 million for the Global Fund and Global Fund programmes (RED) supports have impacted over 5 million people in Sub Saharan Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to (RED), in 2000 at the age of 25, Seb founded Espotting and pioneered search marketing and pay-per-click advertising in Europe. He expanded the business across continental Europe, powering Yahoo!, Ask, Lycos, Alta Vista and many more, before selling the company to US-based FindWhat.com in June 2004 for $186 million. He then led the global rebrand of the combined company under the MIVA name. Following the merger, Seb became President of MIVA (NASDAQ: MIVA). The model of pay-per-click advertising has driven much of the growth in the online advertising market and in 2002, both Google (with their AdWords program) and Yahoo! (through their Overture acquisition) entered the European PPC market. </p>\n\n<p>Seb started his career in advertising and at 19 joined Publicis as an art director. He was part of Rainey Kelly Campbell Rolfe when they successfully took over Y&amp;R London. During his advertising agency years, Seb created the award-winning campaign that launched Coca-Cola in Russia as well as campaigns for some of the world&#8217;s most famous brands, including Virgin, Diet Coke, HP, Renault and Nintendo. </p>\n\n<p>In 2007 Seb featured in The Mission, a Channel 4 documentary in which eight British business leaders spent a month together in a remote region of Uganda, applying Western entrepreneurial skills to try and bring sustainable relief from poverty to affected communities. In the programme, Seb helped create two businesses within the local communities - a farmers co-operative and Teach Inn Uganda, an innovative eco-tourism hotel. Since 2007, Teachinnuganda.com has welcomed many guests to the hotel, generating good income for the parish community.</p>\n\n<p>Seb is also Chairman of Steak Digital, one of the fastest growing digital marketing agencies, an independent non-executive director at Future Publishing plc, a Governor of the School of Communication Arts and is a member of the World Economic Forumâ€™s Young Global Leaders. </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"International CEO","firm":{"name":" (RED)","permalink":"red-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","firm":{"name":"Steak Digital","permalink":"steak-digital","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Investor support","firm":{"name":"Ebuzzing","permalink":"ebuzzing","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,51],"assets/images/resized/0009/4486/94486v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,85],"assets/images/resized/0009/4486/94486v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,154],"assets/images/resized/0009/4486/94486v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Non-Exec Director","firm":{"name":"Future Publishing","permalink":"future-publishing","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder ","firm":{"name":"Espotting","permalink":"espotting","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President / CMO / Board Director","firm":{"name":"MIVA","permalink":"miva","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0002/1728/21728v2-max-150x150.png"],[[158,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/1728/21728v2-max-250x250.png"],[[158,30],"assets/images/resized/0002/1728/21728v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/16-year-old-programmer-raises-seed-round-from-billionaire-li-ka-shing-to-summarize-the-web/","source_description":"16-Year-Old Programmer Raises Seed Round From Billionaire Li Ka Shing To ‘Summarize The Web’","raised_amount":1480000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":13,"company":{"name":"Summly ","permalink":"summly","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,43],"assets/images/resized/0016/6314/166314v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0016/6314/166314v4-max-250x250.png"],[[250,72],"assets/images/resized/0016/6314/166314v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
