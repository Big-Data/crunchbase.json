This special mesh provides for sand, dirt and snow particles to fall through the matting structure, trapping these particles to ensure they do not rise up back through the matting material.</p>\n\n<p>An ongoing commitment to research and development by the CGear team has seen the expansion of products for use by both the military and the outdoor/recreational markets and now CGear is a leading internationally recognized innovator in these specialized fields and markets.</p>\n\n<p>The military products CGear have developed focus on providing solutions to sand and dust abatement for helicopters when landing and taking off.  The CGear patented Tactical Helimat is a light weight transportable Helipad that solves the problem of sand and dust abatement, known as â€œbrownoutsâ€.</p>\n\n<p>The Helimat facilitates increased operational aircraft time, reduced maintenance costs and increased operation safety for aircraft and ground crew. It also reduces ingestion of sand and dust, is lightweight, compact and rapidly deployable, impervious to aviation fuels and oil spills and is flame resistant.</p>\n\n<p>CGear has distributed the Tactical Helimat to the United States Armed Forces (Marines) and other Military operations worldwide.  </p>\n\n<p>Greg holds a Bachelor of Economics, is a qualified Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and Certified Financial Planner (CFP).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[97,127],"assets/images/resized/0003/1183/31183v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[97,127],"assets/images/resized/0003/1183/31183v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[97,127],"assets/images/resized/0003/1183/31183v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Business","institution":"Harvard ","graduated_year":1982,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":250000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":12,"funded_day":1,"company":{"name":"Mayfair Gaming Group","permalink":"mayfair-gaming-group","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0454/30454v2-max-150x150.png"],[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0454/30454v2-max-250x250.png"],[[150,75],"assets/images/resized/0003/0454/30454v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
