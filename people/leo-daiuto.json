At Slamm, Leo works with clients side-by-side to develop the big-picture vision, finding inventive, progressive, yet still really practical solutions to reach their customers. He has a unique talent for understanding what audiences need and want and translating that into cool design and leading-edge technology that people want to use based on sound marketing strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Leo brought more than 20 years of experience as a marketing and design innovator with IT consulting giant Unisys to the mix at Slamm. In various management positions, he married creativity with a can-do attitude to solve real business problems for Unisys and its customers.</p>\n\n<p>Early on, Leo took on the role of Marketing Manager for the North American trade show groups, keeping him on his toes and on the road to present Unisys live in the best light nearly every week of the year. In 2001, Leo was named Engineering Program Manager of the Advanced Technology Group and was responsible for driving the delivery of Server Sentinel 1.0 and Server Sentinel 2.0 (at the time, the leading-edge automatic systems management environment at Unisys).</p>\n\n<p>In 2004, he was brought on to lead Human Factors and Design, a new organization responsible for the usability of Unisys products from a user interface and design point of view. For Unisys, this was a whole new way of approaching its products, and Leoâ€™s persuasive powers shifted the mindset of everyone from engineers to sales and executive management: customers rule and good user design could equal more revenue and profits. Leo tapped his creative life-blood and ability to understand what customers really need. And the buck stopped with his and his multi-million-dollar budgets for defining and designing the complete customer experience of every product developed by his group from engineering (usability, design, look and feel, conceptual design, packaging, installation materials, user interface design, and product support) to presentation (demos, trade shows, micro sites, collateral, and sales presentations). Simply put, he was on the line for ensuring all the products were designed and presented in a visionary and all-around kick-ass fashionâ€”they had to stand out from the competition for customers, for the global Unisys sales organization, and the distribution channel. Leoâ€™s charge was to create brand awareness for new products and reduce costs by simplifying the products to make them more distributable, supportable, and installable. All in all, just making them better. Marrying this attention to the bottom line with his style and finesse, Leo developed the cutting-edge Unisys â€œCenter of Reality,â€ a future technology room offering a high-impact, full-sensory, real-business-world playground for customers and partners to experience the ROI of Unisysâ€™s technology in real-time. Itâ€™s still in use today.</p>\n\n<p>After Hours: Not being a huge fan of sleep, when not having fun at Slamm, Leo keeps busy with his family, playing a little hockey and making music in his recording studio and music production company. Oh yeah, and some other business ventures too â€¦</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/0287/130287v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/0287/130287v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0013/0287/130287v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Leo Daiuto</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Slamm","permalink":"slamm","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Owner","firm":{"name":"01-08 Studios","permalink":"01-08-studios","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director Of User Experience","firm":{"name":"Unisys Corporation","permalink":"unisys-corporation","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,61],"assets/images/resized/0012/3497/123497v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[115,61],"assets/images/resized/0012/3497/123497v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[115,61],"assets/images/resized/0012/3497/123497v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.slamm.com","title":"Slamm"},{"external_url":"http://www.01-08studios.com","title":"01-08studios"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/leoadaiuto","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/leo-daiuto/1/863/b61","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
