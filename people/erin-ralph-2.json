She began working as a fashion journalist at 11 and at 13, she founded her first company LuxuryFashion. With most visitors unaware of her age, Erin ran this digital fashion/lifestyle magazine and interactive community during her teens for over decade. At 25, after taking over the reigns at beauty and fashion magazine ZINK, Erin co-founded a quarterly print arts &amp; fashion magazine Bullett with her brother Nick. After laying the blueprints in inception, building the team, produced initial content/issue and secured international press and distribution, the brother and sister team sold their shares to move onto bigger ideas.</p>\n\n<p>With Nick, Erin has three active projects launching in various phases throughout 2013. Weebo (www.iWeebo.com) is a social shopping portal that rewards members in points for browsing their favorite sites on the internet. Members can then trade in those points for huge discounts at their favorite retailers. The community is set to develop into a shop-and-share social shopping hub. The site is in beta while a browser is developed. UnitedCulture.tv, a self-described passion project, is currently an arts and awakening bulletin but will develop into a digital video/TV network and community by 2013. Erin is also helping Nick with his company Monolith, a membership-based clothing line for men &amp; women where all items are beautifully produced and sell for $111 or under. With its Buy One, Give One program, Monolith is based on a responsible 21st century business model. </p>\n\n<p>In January 2012 Erin relaunched LuxuryFashion.com as a hub for a new era of luxury. </p>\n\n<p>Erin selectively consults business evolution, strategy, consumer communication, innovative marketing, creatives, digital integration, business philosophy, personal motivation and youth intelligence.   </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[133,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/0264/170264v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[222,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/0264/170264v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[285,320],"assets/images/resized/0017/0264/170264v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Cocre","permalink":"cocre","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, Editor in Chief","firm":{"name":"LuxuryFashion.com","permalink":"luxuryfashion-com","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder","firm":{"name":"Weebo","permalink":"weebo","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-founder, Editor","firm":{"name":"UnitedCulture.tv","permalink":"unitedculture-tv","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"iWeebo","permalink":"iweebo","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0015/6907/156907v2-max-150x150.png"],[[169,54],"assets/images/resized/0015/6907/156907v2-max-250x250.png"],[[169,54],"assets/images/resized/0015/6907/156907v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder, Editor in Chief","firm":{"name":"BULLETT Media, LLC","permalink":"bullett-media-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Executive Director","firm":{"name":"Zink Magazine","permalink":"zink-magazine","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.wwd.com/media-news/media-features/the-original-wunderkind-3546871","title":"Women's Wear Daily"},{"external_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Ralph","title":"Wikipedia"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://about.me/erinOralph","title":"About.me"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/erinralph","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/erinralph","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://www.ErinRalph.com","title":"Official Site"}]}
