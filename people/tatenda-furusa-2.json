He loves being labelled an executioner and one of the only people who can clinch a deal in the most interesting of places!  Tatenda&#8217;s talent was unearthed after being named the 2009 winner of a $120,000 sponsored business plan competition (springboard.bradley.edu) and co-founded matchio.com, a collegiate marketplace operating at 6 medium to large sized colleges around the USA. The website enables students to buy and sell goods locally and quickly between each other on their college campus. Lastly, Tatenda has also built up expertise in operations,  international business management and consulting. He is also a Certified Global Business Professional (CGBP). Using these skills and knowledge, he holds the passion to one day create an Africa and US related tech group that exchanges and builds applications mutually between both continents. This group will see US entrepreneurs and investors sharing ideas with African tech start ups, leading to the sharing of ideas and plans for enhanced ICT driven economic growth.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"International Business","subject":"","institution":"Bradley University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co Founder & Business Development","firm":{"name":"Matchio","permalink":"matchio","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0014/1980/141980v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0014/1980/141980v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,120],"assets/images/resized/0014/1980/141980v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
