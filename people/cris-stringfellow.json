In order to conduct the necessary research he developed viable businesses based on the sale of efficient data transformation services to business and government, utilizing advanced trade-secret algorithms, as well as a people meeting service employing an efficient social algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>These successful businesses operate to provide income streams for a dispersed team of contract researchers working around the globe on special projects. </p>\n\n<p>The company, Irrzl Llc, is unusual in that it eschews traditional business practices such as hiring and payroll, preferring to conduct its operations anonymously through alias companies. Employee researchers and programmers, known internally just as &#8220;creatives&#8221;, can request weekly salaries be paid on call. Employees can request any amount they feel they deserve or will allow them to fulfill their work, although not all requests are granted, most employees feel this system can meet their needs.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It allows me to travel flexibly, and be where I need to be,&#8221; said one.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[112,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/5905/75905v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/5905/75905v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[337,450],"assets/images/resized/0007/5905/75905v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Stringfoto / <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stringfoto\" title=\"Stringfoto on Flickr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stringfoto on Flickr</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Chemistry, Mathematics","institution":"The University of Sydney","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Director","firm":{"name":"Decode Media","permalink":"decode-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0011/1751/111751v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0011/1751/111751v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,103],"assets/images/resized/0011/1751/111751v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Trustee","firm":{"name":"Decode Media Holdings","permalink":"decode-media-holdings","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/stringfoto","title":""},{"external_url":"http://au.linkedin.com/in/stringfoto","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/people/stringfoto","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stringfoto","title":""},{"external_url":"http://stringjuice.livejournal.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://stringfoto.posterous.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.google.com/profiles/Cris.Stringfellow","title":""}]}
