Danny fell in love with the juxtaposition of business, technology, and social causes as a student at the University of Pennsylvania. At age 23, he started his first company with a team of leading scientists in the US to find a cure for epilepsy. 2 years later, Danny found his real passion in consumer internet technologies, and spent the summer of 2009 working on the launch of novaglobal.com in Stockholm Sweden under the tutelage of Lars-Henrik Friis Molin. Since late 2009, Danny has been working on Foound as a way for busy city dwellers (read himself) to stay ahead of their social life. Danny won the Intel+UC Berkeley Technology Entrepreneurship Challenge in 2008, and was featured on the Business Timesâ€™ BT-Citibank Young Investorsâ€™ Forum in early 2009. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0009/7019/97019v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[249,250],"assets/images/resized/0009/7019/97019v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[272,273],"assets/images/resized/0009/7019/97019v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"Foound","permalink":"foound","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0010/2268/102268v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,56],"assets/images/resized/0010/2268/102268v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,102],"assets/images/resized/0010/2268/102268v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
