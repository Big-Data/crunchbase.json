He is currently an Innovator in Residence (IIR) at StartX, Stanford&#8217;s student startup accelerator, and has been working in mobile software engineering with the startup PayNearMe for the past two years, traveling to Silicon Valley frequently while finishing high school in Germany.</p>\n\n<p>Catalin grew up and graduated from high school near Heidelberg, Germany. He was always interested in technology and built his first robots and websites at the age of nine. When he was twelve, he taught himself the basics of mobile software development when iPhone apps first became popular. A year later, he started a German podcast about iOS development to share his learning experience with others. Catalin&#8217;s tutorials quickly achieved &gt; 200,000 views and became the #1 podcast on the German iTunes store. In 2009, he began working with a startup in Stuttgart on iPhone Apps for the U.S. Army stationed in Europe and published five applications before he turned 15. Steve Capps, Microsoft fellow and creator of Apple&#8217;s Macintosh and Newton, hired Catalin as a software engineer in 2010 to work on PayNearMe&#8217;s mobile product. Catalin worked on the company&#8217;s iPhone, Android, and web platforms and helped launch a mobile cash payments platform, resulting in his first software patent applications.</p>\n\n<p>At Stanford, Catalin pursues a degree in Computer Science. As an IIR in the StartX program, Catalin works on his own ideas and advises StartX&#8217;s founders on mobile engineering.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6752/216752v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/6752/216752v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/6752/216752v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Soo Ji Lee / <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu\" title=\"Stanford University\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stanford University</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Mobile Software Engieer","firm":{"name":"PayNearMe","permalink":"paynearme","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,46],"assets/images/resized/0007/5992/75992v2-max-150x150.png"],[[178,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/5992/75992v2-max-250x250.png"],[[178,55],"assets/images/resized/0007/5992/75992v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
