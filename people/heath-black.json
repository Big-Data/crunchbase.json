He also serves as a Project Manager from time to time as he&#8217;s overly organized.</p>\n\n<p>His role requires him to build press contacts, write blog posts and press releases for external use and application reviews. He also helps on the business development side to form strategic and affiliate partnerships with trusted Facebook developers.</p>\n\n<p>Heath&#8217;s passion for years has been literature and writing. He&#8217;s synthesized these passions with his other love- technology.</p>\n\n<p>Appbistro is Heath&#8217;s third start-up to be a part of with Ryan Merket, CEO. He doesn&#8217;t consider himself to be an entrepreneur, but a student whether in the classroom or the office, which is why Heath has learned to love and employ technology in his day-to-day musings.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[111,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3049/103049v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[186,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3049/103049v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[335,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3049/103049v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>My Iphone</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.A.","subject":"English Literature","institution":"Oklahoma Wesleyan University","graduated_year":2009,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"M.A","subject":"Modern Irish Literature","institution":"DePaul University","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing Specialist","firm":{"name":"Appbistro","permalink":"appbistro","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,48],"assets/images/resized/0008/7280/87280v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,81],"assets/images/resized/0008/7280/87280v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,146],"assets/images/resized/0008/7280/87280v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Copywriting/Ads","firm":{"name":"Workstir","permalink":"workstir","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0002/6081/26081v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0002/6081/26081v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,64],"assets/images/resized/0002/6081/26081v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://okwueagle.com/2010/06/04/okwu-grad-publishes-book-of-poetry/","title":"OkwuEagle Article"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://appbistro.com","title":"Appbistro"},{"external_url":"http://heathwblack.com","title":"Personal Site"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/heathwblack","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/heathwblack","title":"Twitter"}]}
