David Colbeth has more than 20 years of customer service experience, honing his skills with &#8220;knock your socks off&#8221; personalized service.</p>\n\n<p>Experience - Since 1995, my wife and I have invested in real estate through our own personal residence, rental properties, businesses, and other investments outside of real estate. I help my clients understand how and why they should buy, sell, or invest in real estate as part of their financial portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Commitment - I am committed to helping you achieve your own success whether it&#8217;s selling your current home, buying your first home, or your first investment property. I offer a wide range of programs and services â€“ from first time home buyers, to seasoned investors and those in between. To do an even better job for my clients and stay ahead in a very competitive field, I continue to hone my skills by attending real estate seminars and classes.</p>\n\n<p>Hard Work â€“ I started my career living and working full-time (and then some) in Bonney Lake. Clients can always reach me easily and can be assured of a quick, helpful response.</p>\n\n<p>Enthusiasm â€“ Youâ€™d be hard-pressed to find someone more enthusiastic about real estate. I love what I do! Anticipate and respond to the real estate needs of buyers and sellers, and support the communities you serve. Based on this principle, David has established himself as one of the premier real estate agents in Washington State. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[116,150],"assets/images/resized/0010/3704/103704v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[193,250],"assets/images/resized/0010/3704/103704v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[348,450],"assets/images/resized/0010/3704/103704v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>David Colbeth / <a href=\"http://www.dlcnorthwest.com\" title=\"DLC Northwest\" rel=\"nofollow\">DLC Northwest</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Broker","firm":{"name":"RE/MAX Realty South","permalink":"re-max-realty-south","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Manager","firm":{"name":"DLC Northwest","permalink":"dlc-northwest-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,27],"assets/images/resized/0011/2159/112159v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,41],"assets/images/resized/0011/2159/112159v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,41],"assets/images/resized/0011/2159/112159v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Agent","firm":{"name":"Windermere Real Estate","permalink":"windermere-real-estate","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"EDI Analyst","firm":{"name":"Expeditors International","permalink":"expeditors-international","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0016/0983/160983v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,84],"assets/images/resized/0016/0983/160983v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[388,131],"assets/images/resized/0016/0983/160983v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.YourCommunityHomeSearch.com","title":"Local Home Search"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcolbeth","title":"David's LinkedIn Page"}]}
