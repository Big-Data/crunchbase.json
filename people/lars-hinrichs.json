This early passion for all things digital kick-started his entrepreneurial streak that remains strong today.</p>\n\n<p>One of his first efforts, politik-digital.de, was an award-winning platform for politics and new media he launched at 22. Following that early success, his next venture, a respected new media consulting firm, went bust &#8211; but not without first paying rich dividends in learning.</p>\n\n<p>Lars applied those learnings to his third major effort, XING, a highly successful business networking platform. As Founder and CEO, Lars oversaw its 2006 IPO, making XING the worldâ€™s first Web 2.0 company to go public. He then successfully steered it for two years post IPO, beating all predicted indices and developing a regrettable taste for high calorie energy drinks. He also became active in investing in &#8211; and helping secure funding for &#8211; a wide range of tech startups, proving his instinct for great talent and game-changing ideas.</p>\n\n<p>When heâ€™s not working on his fourth (and most exciting) start-up yet, Lars can be found advising on the Global Leaders of World Economic Forum, the Young Global Leaders, and helping Germany with their digital strategy as part of the UNICEF council.</p>\n\n<p>He also looks back fondly on his ten days of official learning at Harvard Kennedy School - John F. Kennedy School of Government and his countless days of unofficial learning as an enthusiastic TEDster.</p>\n\n<p>And in those welcomed moments when he is offline, Lars enjoys being regularly humbled and awed by his brainy and beautiful wife and their two wonderful children.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/0405/10405v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,190],"assets/images/resized/0001/0405/10405v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,190],"assets/images/resized/0001/0405/10405v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief
