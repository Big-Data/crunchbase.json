His journey started when he managed bands for about four years. With an interest in photography and music, this led him to shoot bands and live concerts. Garyâ€™s experience working with the industries in music, photography, publishing, and sports, has given him the drive and motivation to start A. Refuge.</p>\n\n<p>A.Refuge&#8217;s main goals are inspiring and educating people. Tied to that is the mission of raising awareness and funds for charities. We have the intention of changing the world in a positive way.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006, a short time after A. Refuge started up, Gary became very sick. The illness lasted a couple years and it caused production and funding to come to a halt. After undergoing surgery and waiting through a lengthy recovery process, Gary had a lot of time to reflect on the direction of this project. Now that Gary is in good health, he has perfected his vision of A.Refuge and is ready to continue on his journey. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/2946/82946v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/2946/82946v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/2946/82946v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Portait Photography","institution":"Brooks Institute of Photography","graduated_year":2010,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Aesthetic Refuge","permalink":"aesthetic-refuge","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0008/2952/82952v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/2952/82952v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0008/2952/82952v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Aesthetic Refuge","permalink":"aesthetic-refuge","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0008/2952/82952v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0008/2952/82952v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0008/2952/82952v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Photographing home games of the LA Kings for TheFourthPeriod.com","stoned_year":2011,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":1,"source_url":"http://garylivingston.com/blog/?p=2100","source_text":null,"source_description":"First Time Shooting a Kings Game","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Gary","last_name":"Livingston","permalink":"gary-livingston"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/ifreezetime","title":"Gary Livingston on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/TheGare","title":"Gary Livingston on Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://arefuge.com/Member/iFreezeTime","title":"Gary Livingston on A.Refuge"}]}
