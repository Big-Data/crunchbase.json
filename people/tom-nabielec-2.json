Pay-per-Sale marketing strives to increase acquisitions (sales, leads, etc.) for clients and reduce the cost-per-action. Mr. Nabielec also developed his company&#8217;s unique software that analyses and manages search engine marketing campaigns. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Mr. Nabielec acquired over eight years of experience working in the venture capitalist and private equity industries.

Most notably, he identified, negotiated, and executed a Â£175 million reverse merger of a payroll processor, RebusHR, into Northgate Information Systems. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Mr. Nabielec worked for eVolution Global Partners, an-early stage corporate venturing firm, and preceding that, McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co., a leveraged buyout firm with a focus on business-to-business services in consolidating industries. He began his career at the corporate finance group, Goldman Sachs, in the investment banking division working on equity, debt, and mergers and acquisitions. </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Nabielec graduated with honors from Rice University in 1996 and earned dual degrees in Chemical Engineering and Economics.</p>\n\n<p>At the Affiliate Marketing Awards 2010, his company received &#8220;Highly Commended&#8221; in Best Paid Search Engine Partnership category with Seatwave.
