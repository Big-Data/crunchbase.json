After successfully starting and running a software consulting firm for two years as a student at Morehouse College, Aaron decided to begin his professional career at Goldman Sachs in 2004. At Goldman Sachs Aaron built and supported the Program Trading desk, which executed $4B in notional trades daily (including trades from the algorithmic trading desk). In 2008, Aaron decided to join the head of Product Development at GFI Group to redesign the firmâ€™s Foreign Exchange Options trading technology platform. At GFI, Aaron led innovative advancements that changed a once voice brokerage business model to an award winning electronic derivative trading system that facilitated global trades with the worldâ€™s top financial institutions. While in New York City, Aaron served on three boards: iMentor, Harlem Independent Living Center (HILC), and DSJ Co-op Board of directors.  </p>\n\n<p>At Cornell, Aaron leads the eLab, an incubator that accelerates 9 start-ups in sales, strategy, commercialization, and financing.  Aaron is also a member of the Entrepreneurship@Cornell student board of directors and leads an initiative to create and launch a university wide mobile application that uses geo-networking technology to connect Cornellâ€™s entrepreneurial, venture capital, and private equity communities, which includes alumni, current students, and faculty.   During the 2010 MBA winter break, Aaron developed an access to venture capital strategy and wrote a white paper on venture investing in bio-pharmaceutical start-ups for Ezra Pharmaceuticals, a start-up that leverages intellectual property from Weill Cornell Medical School.  The work for Ezra was an effort to help the start-up raise $10M for phase II clinical trials.  During the 2011 MBA spring break, Aaron led a team of 7 MBAs in the New Orleans IdeaVillage competition where he and his team created a sales pipeline and gained access to distribution in Asia for a local entrepreneur who sold high-end spa equipment.  This summer, Aaron will be working for a NYC venture capital backed start-up that closed a $10M Series C financing round funded by Bain Capital and Canaan Partners.   Aaron is a MLT Fellow and a Consortium for Graduate Study in Management Fellow.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[96,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/0933/130933v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[161,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/0933/130933v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[213,330],"assets/images/resized/0013/0933/130933v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Morehouse College","graduated_year":2004,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Venture Capital","institution":"Cornell University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"COO & Fund Manager","firm":{"name":"BR Ventures","permalink":"br-ventures","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0009/9119/99119v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,152],"assets/images/resized/0009/9119/99119v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,274],"assets/images/resized/0009/9119/99119v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Business Analyst ","firm":{"name":"GFI Group","permalink":"gfi-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,71],"assets/images/resized/0021/7692/217692v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,91],"assets/images/resized/0021/7692/217692v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,91],"assets/images/resized/0021/7692/217692v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
