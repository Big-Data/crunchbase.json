As the founder and president of Water Futures, Inc., Wendy works to find innovative solutions to one of the planetâ€™s most pressing problems â€“ the quest for sustainable water.  </p>\n\n<p>Her passion for mountains, outdoor adventure and other cultures has taken her to places near and far â€“ including Alaska, Patagonia, and the Himalaya â€“ to explore on skis, on foot and by water.  She has taught for MIT and the Sierra Institute and holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from the Parsons Water Resources Laboratory at MIT, an M.S. in Urban Studies and Planning from MIT, an M.S. in Geology from Duke University and a B.A. in Geography from Dartmouth College.
