He is the founder and CEO of StageBloc and speaks regularly about tech, startups, and &#8220;Turning Obstacles into Opportunities.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, five years after breaking his leg in a sledding accident, Tom discovered that his hip was collapsed. A blood vessel had been clipped during the initial surgery to repair the broken leg. For the next eight years Tom would undergo multiple hip surgeries, including two highly experimental and intensive procedures to regrow the bone and cartilage. He would also develop the original version of what would eventually become StageBloc.</p>\n\n<p>Eight years of surgeries left Tom with plenty of free time on his hands. During this time he completed his undergraduate degree in Biology, became a certified middle and high school science teacher, lived in London where he helped manage the multi-platinum recording artist G4, and founded 2.5 companies. He has traveled throughout most of Europe on a cane, taught himself to code, designed websites for such artists as Eminem, Trent Reznor, and the Glitch Mob, and played in a touring rock band.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[132,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/5197/155197v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[220,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5197/155197v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[220,250],"assets/images/resized/0015/5197/155197v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"StageBloc","permalink":"stagebloc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4282/64282v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/4282/64282v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/4282/64282v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://stagebloc.com/tom","title":"StageBloc"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/tomgiles","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasgiles","title":"Linkedin"},{"external_url":"http://tgillees.com/","title":"Personal Site"}]}
