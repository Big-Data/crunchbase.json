Report</em> for four years, Shaneen Murray already had tons of experience under her belt; covering interesting stories and interviewing some of the biggest names in the music industry like Rap stars P. Diddy, Ludacris and T.I., New York City Entertainment Gossip Columnist Wendy Williams, R&amp;B superstars Amel Larrieux and the legendary Patti LaBelle (which happened to be her very first interview.) But it was after receiving her Bachelorâ€™s degree in the summer of â€™06, when this Lady Leo roared on the red carpet at the 2006 BET Awards in LA, which helped her already impressive list of interviews grow tremendously! After completing an internship at <em>FOX News Chicago</em>, Shaneen continued to explore the TV world as a Production Assistant and a News Writer for the station. She also found time to work on an independent film where she landed the role of lead character on her first shot at acting! Many people often ask Shaneen what she does for fun; her reply is usually <em>â€œWork! Work is fun!</em>â€</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor's Degree","subject":"English & Communications","institution":"East-West University","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Consultant","firm":{"name":"Indigo Investment Corporation","permalink":"indigo-investment-corporation","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4325/64325v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/4325/64325v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,300],"assets/images/resized/0006/4325/64325v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://facebook.com/shaneenm1","title":"Shaneen Em"}]}
