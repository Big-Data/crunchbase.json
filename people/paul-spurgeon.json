This narrowing of the discussion results in bringing the discussion to a successful conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>He is likeable and takes the posture that everyone involved in a transaction should feel like they received something they wanted so that no one walks away feeling like they failed in theri negotiaons.</p>\n\n<p>After 25 years and over 200 completed transactions, his experience is so broad he seems to have a solution to what others view as an impossible impasse in a transaction.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/6372/196372v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/6372/196372v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,100],"assets/images/resized/0019/6372/196372v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BBA","subject":"Marketing and Fianance","institution":"Washburn University","graduated_year":1988,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","firm":{"name":"Dot Registry","permalink":"dot-registry","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Nations Media Partners","permalink":"nations-media-partners","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Partner","firm":{"name":"Springboard","permalink":"springboard","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0005/6706/56706v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0005/6706/56706v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,94],"assets/images/resized/0005/6706/56706v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice-President","firm":{"name":"HPC-Puckett","permalink":"hpc-puckett","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"TV One","permalink":"tv-one","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2004/03/22/daily24.html","title":"ILEC Sale Release"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.nationsmedia.com","title":""}]}
