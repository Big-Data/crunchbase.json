At SunRun, Ed focuses on finance, fleet operations, legal, and regulatory affairs. Under his leadership, the Company was the only residential solar company to enjoy an uninterrupted source of project financing through the 2007-2010 financial crisis. On the legal and regulatory side he works to shape policy and help build a sustainable subsidy-free solar industry. In 2011, Ed facilitated a partnership between SunRun and U.S. Bancorp to support the purchase of $200 million in residential solar systems, a commitment that represents that bankâ€™s largest single tax equity investment to date. In 2010 he and co-founder Lynn Jurich received the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for Northern California. Before SunRun, Ed served as Director of Corporate Development at Asurion Corporation. He also worked at The Blackstone Group, completing more than $10 billion in private equity and merger and acquisitions transactions. He is a member of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, serves as an Advisory Partner to Millennium Technology Value Partners, and holds an MBA from Stanford University and a BA from The Johns Hopkins University.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/7847/47847v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/7847/47847v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,300],"assets/images/resized/0004/7847/47847v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA ","subject":"","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Executive Officer","firm":{"name":"Sunrun","permalink":"sunrun","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,67],"assets/images/resized/0004/6412/46412v9-max-150x150.png"],[[250,111],"assets/images/resized/0004/6412/46412v9-max-250x250.png"],[[450,201],"assets/images/resized/0004/6412/46412v9-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
