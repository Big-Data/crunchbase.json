That&#8217;s an easy question - I&#8217;m a VP of HR type who has led HR practices in Fortune 500s and venture capital-held startups. I work for a living, and believe that the key to great business results is to get great people, then do cool stuff to maximize their motivation, performance and effectiveness once you have them in the door. As it turns out, that&#8217;s my simple definition of talent management. I believe that all forms of HR administration should be squeezed down to the smallest amount of time possible, giving you more time to do stuff that matters. </p>\n\n<p>BOOM! If you like that description, you&#8217;ll like me. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also among the most transparent HR pros you can find, and here&#8217;s why. I care so much about the art of HR that I&#8217;ve started two blogs (www.hrcapitalist.com and www.fistfuloftalent.com) with the goal of building a community I could learn from. I&#8217;ve been putting my thoughts down every business day for over 3 years. </p>\n\n<p>That means what you see is what you get. I can&#8217;t hide, and if I ever pulled the blogs down, Google would probably haunt me forever anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Specialties\nBelief that the HR function rocks. Business chops.
