After holding a position as a Quality Control Chemist with Lonza, Inc., Dr. Ritter began investigations into the mechanisms involved in cell adhesion, migration and signaling as they relate to angiogenesis and tumor biology. Upon completion of his graduate studies, Dr. Ritter then applied his experience to the study of blood vessel biology in the eye. More recently, he identified and characterized a population of progenitor cells that influence blood vessel repair and stability in the retina, establishing him as a co-inventor of EyeCyteâ€™s core technologies. He is an author of numerous scientific articles, reviews and patents and holds a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences from The University of California, Irvine and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Southern California.
