I have been involved with art for most of my life. My knowledge is all self learned. I&#8217;ve never had any official education in the subject so my results all come from things learned naturally. I have made a website that focuses on showing fine art and giving suggestions for visitors in how they can better improve the atmosphere of their home or workplace with well made pieces of art. The site also gives advice in picking out well done works. The site caters to all people interested in art, from professionals to amateurs to people who just want to learn more about this great form of expression.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
