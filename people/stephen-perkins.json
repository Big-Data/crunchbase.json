From the age of 13, he has been passionate about online media, entrepreneurship, and technology.</p>\n\n<p>Stephen’s entrepreneurial career has been a bumpy one that is finally starting to level out. When he was only thirteen, he started a web design company without having any knowledge in website design and it was only a matter of months before he decided to close up shop in lieu of producing subpar work.</p>\n\n<p>But it wasn’t before long until he started The Perkins Group, an internet marketing company with the goal of helping small businesses build an online presence. And even though he was a talented internet marketer, he decided it wasn’t something he wanted to do and decided to close the company.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in January of 2011, he founded LittleAlien Media, an online media venture development company that he still runs today. In addition, Stephen is the Editor-In-Chief of ReactrMag and the Managing Editor of EpicLaunch.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/9177/119177v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/9177/119177v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/9177/119177v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.sperkinsblog.com/about-me/</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder/ Project Manager","firm":{"name":"ReactrMedia","permalink":"littlealien-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,17],"assets/images/resized/0013/4669/134669v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,29],"assets/images/resized/0013/4669/134669v7-max-250x250.png"],[[427,50],"assets/images/resized/0013/4669/134669v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Editor-In-Chief","firm":{"name":"ReactrMag","permalink":"reactrmag","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,25],"assets/images/resized/0019/3022/193022v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,41],"assets/images/resized/0019/3022/193022v5-max-250x250.png"],[[360,60],"assets/images/resized/0019/3022/193022v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Managing Editor","firm":{"name":"EpicLaunch","permalink":"epiclaunch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/7668/117668v2-max-150x150.png"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/7668/117668v2-max-250x250.png"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0011/7668/117668v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Consultant","firm":{"name":"The Perkins Group","permalink":"the-perkins-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0013/4670/134670v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,92],"assets/images/resized/0013/4670/134670v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,166],"assets/images/resized/0013/4670/134670v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director of Marketing","firm":{"name":"StartupLocker","permalink":"startuplocker","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Owner","firm":{"name":"Ticket Toss","permalink":"ticket-toss","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0012/2957/122957v2-max-150x150.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0012/2957/122957v2-max-250x250.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0012/2957/122957v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Stephen launches ReactrMag -  a new business and technology news site geared towards young entrepreneurs.","stoned_year":2012,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":2,"source_url":"http://www.sperkinsblog.com/2012/04/03/launching-reactrmag/","source_text":null,"source_description":"Launching ReactrMag","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Perkins","permalink":"stephen-perkins"}}],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://epiclaunch.com/author/stephenperkins/","title":"Contributions to EpicLaunch"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/Stephen_Perkins","title":"Stephen Perkins on Twitter"}]}
