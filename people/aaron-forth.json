Aaron held the title of Product Manager but did many jobs.  Everything from selling, implementing, supporting and managing the evolution of Kana&#8217;s products gave Aaron a deep understanding of how Kana&#8217;s clients (companies like eBay and Ford) used CRM to manage their businesses. In his time Kana grew from twenty employees to over one thousand and in 1999 went public.</p>\n\n<p>After Kana Aaron joined another startup, Half.com.  Half.com, a Philadelphia based person-to-person marketplace, was acquired by eBay Inc. in 2000.  Over 5+ years Aaron held several leadership positions at Half / eBay Inc. with responsible for Product strategy, Design and Product Development.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2007 Aaron left eBay Inc. to become VP of Product at Mint.com. Aaron was responsible for Product Management, Design, Customer Service and Analytics.  When he joined, Mint.com was pre-launch but soon won TechCrunch 40.  Over the next two years Mint.com grew dramatically, inspiring Intuit Inc. to acquire the company in 2009.  Aaron stayed on with Intuit through July 2012, serving for the last year as Vice President &amp; General Manager of Personal Finance.  As GM he oversaw Product, Engineering, Marketing and Business Development across Quicken and Mint.com.     </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0008/3055/83055v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0008/3055/83055v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0008/3055/83055v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"Earth Science","institution":"UC Berkeley","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Vp Product","firm":{"name":"Mint.com","permalink":"mint","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,61],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-150x150.png"],[[194,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-250x250.png"],[[194,80],"assets/images/resized/0000/0298/298v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Managment","firm":{"name":"Half","permalink":"half","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Management","firm":{"name":"KANA Software, Inc.
