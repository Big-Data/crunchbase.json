He was known as RadioStar from 1988 until 1995 on USENET and many BBSs including the one he ran from 1992 to 1995 out of Marietta, Georgia called UWDO (Uplink World Digital Office). His vision was to get businesses &#8220;online&#8221; to allow access outside of the strict confines of AOL and Prodigy.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998 he was hired by Loomis&amp;Fargo to create a fairly complex database of their employees to track licensing, weapons permits and other secure and senstive data which lead to a full compliment of e-commerce applications being developed for dozens of top and Fortune 1000 companies.</p>\n\n<p>During this time he also participated in the Gossamer Threads search engine technology project and developed a couple of C+ and Perl driven spiders with PHP/MySQL user interface and results engine. His early experience with creating search algorithms goes a long way to helping him understand how search engines think. </p>\n\n<p>Ken&#8217;s current project of interest is as Senior Developer and Project Advisor for start-up cheepmonkey.com founded by business investor Raymond Palermo. The project is currently seeking funding and expects to launch in late 2011.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/1785/131785v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0013/1785/131785v2-max-250x250.png"],[[271,271],"assets/images/resized/0013/1785/131785v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Social Media Edge","permalink":"social-media-edge","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Community Outreach Leader","firm":{"name":"AmericaHomeKey Mortgage","permalink":"americahomekey-mortgage","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://cheepmonkey.com","title":""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/thekencook","title":""},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/americahomekey","title":""},{"external_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/kencook","title":""}]}
