His experience spans nearly 100 employers since 1995.</p>\n\n<p>With more real world job experience than nearly anyone he knows, he has often been the go-to-guy when it comes to business brainstorming. The entrepreneur bug hit Jason early on as sticking to one industry became nearly impossible. As soon as he had enough money he started his first business. It was a disaster. So he went back to the corporate world. </p>\n\n<p>After stints in several large organizations and heavy analysis of his previous venture, he realized the only way to be happy in life is to find what he was good at, become the best in his field of expertise and offer that talent to others. Jason happens to enjoy learning about the Internet and Psychiatry. So, armed with a head full of Internet and Marketing related knowledge, he Co-Founded Ocelot Marketing, a performance-driven internet marketing company. </p>\n\n<p>After a paradigm shift in his life which ultimately saved him from himsef, he molded Ocelot Marketing around integrity and results. He based Ocelot&#8217;s operation on helping people utilize the latest information technology, not only for fund-raising, but for the collective betterment of mankind.</p>\n\n<p>Jason has a non-stop internal motor and shares helpful information with nearly everyone he comes into contact with. An excellent strategizer and pattern recognition expert, he feels the need to constantly pay tribute to his Mom for giving him his most precious and prized possession: his first computer.</p>\n\n<p>Jason also loves riding and working on two wheeled transportation. He has an obsession with the Gears of War franchise, enjoys any outdoor activities and can build furniture in his spare time. Jason enjoys meeting and helping new people, sharing new technology with others, and discovering the internet. His advice to anyone who will listen is pretty simple:</p>\n\n<p>â€œThese are the keys to success. Discover your strengths and weaknesses. Seek out people with complimentary talents you do not possess. Make detail oriented action item lists based around a common goal. Proceed with accountability to deadlines. And finally: Just Do It.â€</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Ocelot Marketing LLC","permalink":"ocelot-marketing-llc","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0010/3493/103493v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0010/3493/103493v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,92],"assets/images/resized/0010/3493/103493v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/32ndboyscout","title":"Video Channel"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://chromerobotics.com","title":"Chrome Robotics"}]}
