Currently, he is the CEO of Victors &amp; Spoils, the worldâ€™s first creative (ad) agency built on crowdsourcing principles. The launch of Victors &amp; Spoils in the autumn of 2009 made instant waves in the industry, marking the advent of a new era in regard to the perception of crowdsourcing within advertising. Â Victors &amp; Spoils now works with CMOs at Fortune 500 companies and continues to turn heads as its clever output reaches the mainstream. The agency was named by Advertising Age as one of the â€œTop 10 Agencies to Watchâ€ in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Before Victors &amp; Spoils, Winsor was the VP/Executive Director of Strategy and Innovation at Crispin, Porter + Bogusky helping the company become the most awarded advertising agency in the world for the last two years. In 2007, Winsor sold his company, Radar Communications, to CP+B. He founded Radar in 1998 with Nike as its first client. Using strategy and academic-based market intelligence tools, Winsor helped some of the country&#8217;s most progressive companies learn from key voices in their communities through methods he gleaned from his years as a journalist. Prior to founding Radar, Winsor built a magazine publishing company devoted to sports such as mountain biking, in-line skating, and extreme skiing. In 1990, he acquired the rights to publish a then-struggling magazine, Women&#8217;s Sports &amp; Fitness. Within three years he turned the magazine around and launched several other highly profitable titles and events including The Gravity Games, selling the business to Conde Nast in 1998.Â </p>\n\n<p>Winsor is also a frequent industry speaker and respected author. His body of work includes Beyond the Brand: Why Engaging the Right Customers is Essential to Winning in Business (2004), Spark: Be more Innovative through Co-Creation (2005), Baked In: The Power of Aligning Marketing and Product Innovation (2009) and Flipped: How Bottom-Up Co-creation is Replacing Top-Down Innovation (2010). Baked-In was named as an award winner in the Marketing category for the 800-CEO-Read 2009 Business Book Awards. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/9225/129225v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/9225/129225v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/9225/129225v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
