He says it has something to do with him being a Pisces. Then, in 5th grade, he got his first computer, and it all became clear what his real passion is. And it isnâ€™t messing around with fish.</p>\n\n<p>Chris is a technology expert, doing great things with software that only other technology experts understand. A life-long music lover, he is happiest when working on projects that combine technology with music. </p>\n\n<p>At trueAnthem, Chris gets to be happy every day. He designed the widget, the neat technology gadget that lets trueAnthem&#8217;s bands share their music with their fans for free â€“ and lets fans listen to their favorite bands, spreading their music virally. And as if that isn&#8217;t enough fun, Chris also gets to listen to trueAnthem&#8217;s bands all day long.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,115],"assets/images/resized/0013/7690/137690v2-max-150x150.png"],[[115,115],"assets/images/resized/0013/7690/137690v2-max-250x250.png"],[[115,115],"assets/images/resized/0013/7690/137690v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"trueAnthem","permalink":"trueanthem","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0002/2243/22243v8-max-150x150.png"],[[173,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/2243/22243v8-max-250x250.png"],[[173,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/2243/22243v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
