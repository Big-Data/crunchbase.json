True to the â€œall hands on deckâ€ mentality, he works closely with all departments to ensure that the best product is presented to users every day.</p>\n\n<p>Joe is a graduate of Bellarmine University, a small liberal arts university in the Midwest and never thought his bio would be published on a site like this. In 1994, he joined International Data Group (IDG) in Boston as a publisher. While there, he launched one of the internet&#8217;s first email-focused businesses, Tipworld, and developed an appreciation for the Red Sox. Since then, he founded, sold and re-purchased Emazing.com, had a torrid three-year affair with Sony Music as senior vice president and later ran back into the arms of IDG as resident email geek. He is married to a beautiful woman whom he believes is too good for him, and has two sons.&#8221; Many people have been on the record as stating Pierce is &#8220;not the brightest bulb in the room.&#8221; He has wasted  many people&#8217;s time and has never produced anything that made a profit.
