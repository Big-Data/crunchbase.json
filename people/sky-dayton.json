EarthLink grew to serve millions of consumers and helped usher in the Internet revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Sky has founded, co-founded or helped build several companies with an aggregate market value of nearly $3 billion. These include EarthLink (IPO in 1997), JAMDAT Mobile (purchased by Electronic Arts in 2005), LowerMyBills (purchased by Experian in 2005), Neopets (purchased by Viacom in 2005), Business.com (purchased by RH Donnelly in 2007), Helio (purchased by Virgin Mobile USA in 2008) and Boingo Wireless, which Sky founded in 2001 and where he currently serves as chairman.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to EarthLink, Sky co-founded a computer graphics boutique catering to the entertainment industry, and a popular coffeehouse in West Hollywood, Calif. He graduated from the Delphian School in Oregon in 1988 and chose to forgo college to pursue his interests in business and technology.</p>\n\n<p>Sky has received numerous awards and honors. He was named one of Business Weekâ€™s top seven entrepreneurs and chosen as the University of Southern California&#8217;s entrepreneur of the year. He has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, WIRED, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, CNN and in hundreds of other media.</p>\n\n<p>Sky is currently the chairman of Boingo Wireless, and serves on the advisory board of the Center for Public Leadership at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.</p>\n\n<p>An avid surfer, he resides in California, with his wife, novelist Arwen Elys Dayton, and their three children.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & Chairman","firm":{"name":"Boingo
