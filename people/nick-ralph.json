Big APPl Labs is a New York based team of creative, operational and tech guns focused on building disruptive mobile experiences. Big APPl Labs is divided into two companies with an engineering division and an operational division. Each is tirelessly committed to building and scaling the best mobile products enabling each department to focus on what they do best. Big APPl Labs creates 3-4 concepts per year ultimately bringing 1-2 to market. Big APPl Labs owns the majority of the concepts splitting the remaining ownership with its team.
