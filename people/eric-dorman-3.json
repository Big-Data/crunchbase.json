Eric Dorman is a security researcher and the inventor of &#8220;The Dorman Model&#8221; .</p>\n\n<p>The Dorman Model is a layered model that is also called the â€œsandwich modelâ€ which layers each process into a vertical row. These processes that are written in each layer can be any process that describes what is actually going on inside a specific networking device. Eric Dorman developed this model because he felt that networking icons in networking diagrams havenâ€™t had enough detail to show what is actually going on between different devices on a IT network.\nMore documentation can be found about The Dorman Model at Eric Dorman&#8217;s recent blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Any type of networking device can be illustrated to show how it&#8217;s functioning or even how it works with a certain network protocol. The most common network protocol that usually is included in the model is the Transmission Control Protocol or (TCP). Other protocols that can be used are SMTP, UDP, PPP, and many others.</p>\n\n<p>The OSI Model also can be included to show how different networking devices are related to a particular OSI layer.</p>\n\n<p>The Dorman Model is open source under the Creative Commons Attribution License.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0007/0041/70041v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0007/0041/70041v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,337],"assets/images/resized/0007/0041/70041v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"Dorman Media","permalink":"dorman-media","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder & Director Of Search","firm":{"name":"Sportsaholic","permalink":"sportsaholic-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0005/0419/50419v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,79],"assets/images/resized/0005/0419/50419v1-max-250x250.png"],[[279,89],"assets/images/resized/0005/0419/50419v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder/ Developer","firm":{"name":"Bleacher Advisor","permalink":"bleacher-advisor","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder/ Developer","firm":{"name":"Sideline Report ","permalink":"sideline-report","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,101],"assets/images/resized/0001/9058/19058v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,129],"assets/images/resized/0001/9058/19058v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,129],"assets/images/resized/0001/9058/19058v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Developer/ Founder","firm":{"name":"iPads","permalink":"ipads","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0002/5066/25066v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,141],"assets/images/resized/0002/5066/25066v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[313,177],"assets/images/resized/0002/5066/25066v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Eric Dorman Steps Down As developer of iPads","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":3,"stoned_day":9,"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Dorman","permalink":"eric-dorman-3"}},{"description":"Eric Dorman develops new networking diagram model solution to improve network design.
