Since then, he has worked at Fortune 500 companies (steel, food &amp; technology). He has also founded a couple of technology startups: eCircle was acquired by Reliance, Opelin by Hewlett-Packard and most recently Whodini. The products that his teams have built have been used by nearly 5M users in 22 languages in 25 countries. Along the way, he has coauthored 7 patents; his undergrad work in Literature helped. He is also an MBA, a member of Sand Hill Angels and a charter member of TiE.</p>\n\n<p>At play:\nAni has hiked the Grand Canyon rim to rim in summer, twice. Exhilarating madness.
