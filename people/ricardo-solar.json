With all the changes going on in the economy today, Solar decided the world could use a formalized approach to help people think through all the factors relevant to making difficult decisions.  Solar assembled a team of experts in applied mathematics, psychology and creative writing and developed a sophisticated tool based on scientific methods.  In the end, LetSimonDecide.com was born.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to founding Ayax Systems, Solar was Sr. Director of Worldwide Brand Merchandising at Mattel Inc., leading global retail initiatives in Asia and Latin America.  </p>\n\n<p>Solar holds a BA in Industrial Design from the National Autonomous University in MÃ©xico City and a Specialization in Marketing from the Technologic Institute of Monterrey.  </p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, President & CEO","firm":{"name":"Ayax Systems","permalink":"ayax-systems","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0004/2787/42787v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,114],"assets/images/resized/0004/2787/42787v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,205],"assets/images/resized/0004/2787/42787v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
