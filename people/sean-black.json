As business rapidly moved to the cloud, that translated into building an online meeting platform that doesn’t suck and provides analytics and insights into what really happens every day on the front lines with customers.</p>\n\n<p>From 2005 to 2010, Sean was founding VP, Sales at Trulia, where he was part of the founding team that built Trulia into what is now the second largest consumer real estate site in the US.  The three sales teams started under Sean’s leadership now account for 250+ of Trulia’s 500+ employees and led Trulia to profitability in 2010, despite the worst real estate market and recession in 20 years.  Before reaching profitability, Trulia raised over $33M from prominent investors including Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, investors in Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Facebook &amp; Apple.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/7738/207738v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0020/7738/207738v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0020/7738/207738v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"Entrepreneurship","institution":"Babson College","graduated_year":2000,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Crunched","permalink":"salescrunch","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/6957/116957v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/6957/116957v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[356,356],"assets/images/resized/0011/6957/116957v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founding VP of Sales","firm":{"name":"Trulia","permalink":"trulia","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/4504/4504v5-max-150x150.png"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0000/4504/4504v5-max-250x250.png"],[[450,148],"assets/images/resized/0000/4504/4504v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/SeanBlack","title":"Twitter"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/seanblack","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
