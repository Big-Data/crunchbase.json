I am honored to join such a dedicated team and look forward to working towards achieving the companyâ€™s much deserved success.â€\r\n\r\nA short biography for Mr. Brown has been provided below.\r\n\r\nAbout Infrastruct: \r\nInfrastruct Security, Inc. is a full service security integrator specializing in the design, implementation, installation and maintenance of security systems for industrial, chemical, government and commercial facilities.\r\n\r\nExecutive Bio for James F. Brown\r\n\r\n\r\nJames F. â€œJimâ€ Brown is an exceptionally resourceful top line business executive whose prestigious education is combined with an impressive record of top personal productivity.\r\n\r\nAfter he graduated in the top 5% of his High School class, Jim was accepted into the rigorous officer training and academic degree program at the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1978.  Four rigorous years of engineering studies, leadership doctrine, and hands-on maritime training aboard a variety of ships resulted in Jimâ€™s graduation in the Top 20 of his class with High Honors along with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering.  He was commissioned as Officer in the United Sates Coast Guard in 1982.\r\n\r\nJim accepted a Marketing Development Manager position with the Information Services Division of GTE (now Verizon) in the summer of 1992.  He was handed a portfolio of GTE telco products to direct with annual revenues exceeding $250 million.  He drove unusually strong results and was promoted into a Regional Management position in 1996.  Shortly thereafter, Jim was offered a promotion to GTEâ€™s corporate headquarters in Texas.\r\n\r\nLeaving GTE in 1996, Jim embraced a new opportunity with a very small, struggling telecommunications contractor by the name of Active Communications (ACTCOM).  Applying all of his skills and know-how, Jim set to work casting in place an actionable Strategic Plan which would see ACTCOM rapidly develop into one of Seattleâ€™s most prominent technology enterprises.  Over the course of the next five years, under his leadership and guidance, ACTCOM became 125 employees strong as a true professional services entity with revenues surpassing $15 million. Most impressively, this was achieved in a carefully managed fashion, with close attention paid to positive cash flow, attractive financial results and the development of a high class corporate culture bent on quality and customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJim led all acquisition due diligence, negotiation and transaction activities between ACTCOM and a venture capital group named NetVersant.  Jim applied sound negotiating tactics and valuation techniques to obtain maximum economic value in the $5 million purchase which closed in June of 2000.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Jim was handpicked by NetVersantâ€™s CEO to relocate from Seattle to Atlanta.  By the middle of 2002, Atlanta became NetVersantâ€™s fastest growing office as Jim was awarded a $25 million national contract with The Home Depot for a full systems upgrade at all 1400 of their locations from coast to coast as well as a $7 million national contract with Delta Airlines to install their first generation of customer kiosks.\r\n\r\nThen, in 2003, Jim was presented with a compelling restructuring and equity opportunity outside of the telecommunications market â€“ Evans Industries.   With an employee base of more than 400, the company had manufacturing plant locations in New Orleans, Houston, and central Oklahoma.   Jim was contracted in January of 2003 by Glass & Associates, a consultant firm out of Michigan, to serve as a senior consultant to the Evans in the capacity of â€œEastern Region Vice Presidentâ€.  His charter was to declare and direct â€œturn aroundâ€ business activities throughout the financially distressed enterprise in order to position and promote company for venture capital infusion.  The structure of the infusion would see Jim, and other players on the turn-around team, become significant equity players. By applying time-motion manufacturing improvements and developing preventative maintenance programs throughout the aging manufacturing plants, daily productivity increased by more than 50%.  Jim designed and implemented performance based incentive plans which inspired and rewarded swiftly increasing levels of output.\r\n\r\nJim next turned his attentions to the professional sound and video marketplace with his assignment as President of South Central Sound in March of 2005.  Jim assumed top level executive authority of a ramshackle, dispirited and brandless 45 year old Muzak franchise with 10 locations in 6 states and rapidly transformed it into the most sales driven, powerfully branded, operationally adept affiliate in the country.  New recurring billing sales growth at South Central Sound in 2007 led all other locations nationwide.  The sales force grew from 6 to 26 FTEâ€™s inside of 24 months.  In 2007, Jim sold and project managed the largest, most profitable contract in the companyâ€™s history (Turnberry Townsquare Las Vegas).","source_description":"James F.
