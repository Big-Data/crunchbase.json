Growing up in NJ, she was always involved in various art classes at the neighborhood community center and formal Art Schools where she explored every medium.   At Temple University, in Philadelphia, Wendy continued to explore art while also learning more about another one of her passions â€“ the sciences.  She ultimately earned a degree in Journalism and Advertising  - â€œbalancing the strengths of both the left and right sides of her brainâ€, as she puts it. \nEntering the working world in sales her creative side allowed Wendy to stand out from the crowd and succeed in tough industries, the first being copier sales and the majority of her career in Pharmaceuticals.  Throughout her successful 16-year career in Bio-Pharma and Pharma as a Sales and Marketing leader Wendyâ€™s entrepreneurial spirit was always driving her to do more â€“ and then finally the stars aligned. \nIt was an interesting series of three events in 2009 that led Wolf to the idea that started Three Sisters&#8217; Marketplace â€“ a family vacation to Monument Valley, a 4th grade field trip to an organic farm and a dinner party with family and then there it was - Three Sisters&#8217; Marketplace! You can read the details of the genesis on Wendyâ€™s blog here: http://threesistersmarketplace.com/about/blog \nThe â€œthree sistersâ€ are actually corn, beans, and squash â€“ and the fact that Wolfâ€™s husband has three sisters played into the idea as well.  The corn stalk serves as a pole for the beans; the beans climb the stalk and help support it against the wind and also provide nitrogen to fertilize the soil; the broad leaves of the squash protect the sisters from weeds and keep moisture in the soil by shading it. The plants and the sisters all bring something unique and creative into the balance of â€˜threeâ€™.  The three plants flourish because they work and grow together â€“ just as artisans, shoppers and our online community do on Three Sisters&#8217; Marketplace (www.threesistersmarketplace.com) . \nThree Sisters Marketplace is a family business. Wendy is a wife, mom, artist, sales person, marketer and leader who is now using the skills sheâ€™s honed to launch a dream. The purpose is to bring the â€˜Main Street shopping experience online.â€  Three Sistersâ€™ Marketplace is a people connector that satisfies the needs of everyone in the mix and that also allows everyone to have fun in the process.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0012/9024/129024v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0012/9024/129024v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0012/9024/129024v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Arts \t       ","subject":"Journalism/Advertising with Minor in Biology","institution":"Temple University","graduated_year":1992,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.examiner.com/arts-and-crafts-in-philadelphia/three-sisters-market-place-is-creating-an-online-community-for-artists","title":"PhiladelphiaExaminer.com"},{"external_url":"http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/on-air/as-seen-on/Local_Mom_Helps_Artist_Sell_Work_Philadelphia-117283513.html","title":"NBC 10 Philadelphia Spot"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"https://www.facebook.com/threesistersmarketplace","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/ThreeSistersMkt","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfw","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
