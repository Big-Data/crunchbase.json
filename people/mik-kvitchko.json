He was the author of a very popular toolbox of system utilities but, unlike Peter Norton, distributed it for free. </p>\n\n<p>After arriving in the US in 1990, Mik worked for Coopers &amp; Lybrand. In 1991 he joined Markov Processes and steered the company in the direction of commercial software development. His main emphasis in programming is the overall system design and the user interface in particular. In 1992, together with Michael Markov, he developed the first returns-based style analysis software, the design of which got a &#8220;Wow!&#8221; from Nobel Prize laureate William F. Sharpe. </p>\n\n<p>Since then Mik&#8217;s break-through design ideas have become the trademark of all MPI&#8217;s products. In his spare time he writes compilers and windsurfs. Mik has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Kharkov Polytechnic University, Ukraine.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/6305/216305v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[143,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/6305/216305v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[143,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/6305/216305v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Technology Officer","firm":{"name":"Markov Processes International","permalink":"markov-processes-international","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,121],"assets/images/resized/0021/6175/216175v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[100,121],"assets/images/resized/0021/6175/216175v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[100,121],"assets/images/resized/0021/6175/216175v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
