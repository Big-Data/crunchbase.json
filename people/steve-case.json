To that end, he and his wife, Jean Case, created the Case Foundation in 1997.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2005, Steve launched Revolution, a company that seeks to drive transformative change by shifting power to consumers. Revolution&#8217;s mission is to partner with entrepreneurs in building businesses that give people more choice, control, and convenience in important areas of their lives. Current activities are focused on companies in the real estate/resort, wellness, and health care sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to starting Revolution, Steve was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of America Online, Inc. (AOL) and, later, the chairman of AOL Time Warner. As the co-founder of AOL, Steve played an integral role in building the world&#8217;s largest Internet company and helped transform how people communicate, learn, and conduct business. AOL brought millions of Americans their first connection to the Internet and drove worldwide adoption of a medium that has become more valuable than the telephone or television. Steve also ensured that AOL led the industry on issues like making the Internet a safe place for children, bridging the &#8220;digital divide,&#8221; and investing in online philanthropy. When AOL merged with Time Warner in 2001, Steve served as the chairman of the new company.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to chairing the Case Foundation, he is chairman of Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure (ABC2), a nonprofit with an entrepreneurial approach to funding brain cancer research that he founded in 2001 with his late brother Dan. In addition, Steve was a founding organizer of Business Strengthening America and has served as vice chair of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy. He was also honored with the National Mentoring Partnership Leadership Award.</p>\n\n<p>Steve was born and raised in Hawaii, where he remains a leading advocate for combining respect for the islands&#8217; native people, culture, and environment with job creation and economic growth. He is a major investor in two Hawaiian businesses &#8211; Grove Farm of Kauai and Maui Land &amp; Pineapple &#8211; that are developing fresh operating models for the agriculture industry and sustainable communities for residents and visitors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/7170/77170v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0007/7170/77170v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0007/7170/77170v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","firm":{"name":"The
