He was fluent in PHP and Python long before achieving a reasonable level with his mother tang. He somehow didnâ€™t know where or when to stop and as a result now he can use perfectly almost all programming languages. Nenko is a real technology polyglot. The variety of choices that he masters allows him to architecture and create fast, powerful and scalable web applications. Nenko is a proud father of two sons: a baby boy called Daniel and the Real-time engine of FAVIT.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/3785/73785v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[153,153],"assets/images/resized/0007/3785/73785v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[153,153],"assets/images/resized/0007/3785/73785v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Mathematics","institution":"Sofia University","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","firm":{"name":"favit Network","permalink":"favit-network","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,44],"assets/images/resized/0007/3184/73184v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,74],"assets/images/resized/0007/3184/73184v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,134],"assets/images/resized/0007/3184/73184v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/nenko","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/nenko","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://bg.linkedin.com/in/nenko","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
