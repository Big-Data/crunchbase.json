Prior to founding Wonga, he successfully built two other businesses in completely different markets. </p>\n\n<p>He was founder and CEO of Supply Chain Connect Ltd, which he developed to become one of the worldâ€™s leading providers of hosted supply chain collaboration solutions. With offices in the UK and US, the company serviced over 250 blue chip customers - including General Cable, Pirelli, Dow Chemical and DuPont - and was acquired by ChemConnect in 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Errolâ€™s first start-up experience was in Israel where, in 1997, he was part of the founding team at Barzelan Ltd. The business rapidly grew to over 100 employees and became a global leader in advanced steel wire production.</p>\n\n<p>Wonga is undoubtedly Errolâ€™s most ambitious project yet, with the aim of revolutionising the UKâ€™s huge consumer credit market. It was 2006 when he first set about enabling people to manage their cash flow without the need for a long-term credit card dependency. </p>\n\n<p>Leveraging purpose-built, real-time risk and decisioning technology, Wonga became operational in 2007. The company now provides short-term cash advances to thousands of customers every month - entirely online and with unparalleled speed and convenience.</p>\n\n<p>Errol grew up in South Africa, before spending eight years in Israel. Following graduation from business school, he became a successful investment banker and, while helping entrepreneurs turn their dreams into reality, was inspired to switch roles and become the innovator. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,99],"assets/images/resized/0008/2202/82202v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0008/2202/82202v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,299],"assets/images/resized/0008/2202/82202v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Wonga.com</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Wonga","permalink":"wonga","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,89],"assets/images/resized/0001/8425/18425v1-max-150x150.png"],[[161,96],"assets/images/resized/0001/8425/18425v1-max-250x250.png"],[[161,96],"assets/images/resized/0001/8425/18425v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","firm":{"name":"Supply Chain Connect","permalink":"supply-chain-connect","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,68],"assets/images/resized/0007/2514/72514v1-max-150x150.png"],[[206,94],"assets/images/resized/0007/2514/72514v1-max-250x250.png"],[[206,94],"assets/images/resized/0007/2514/72514v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[{"funding_round":{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/17/real-estate-site-vivareal-raises-cash-to-be-the-zillow-for-brazil/","source_description":"Real Estate Site VivaReal Raises Cash To Be The Zillow For Brazil","raised_amount":null,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2012,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":17,"company":{"name":"VivaReal","permalink":"vivareal","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/6752/146752v2-max-150x150.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0014/6752/146752v2-max-250x250.png"],[[180,180],"assets/images/resized/0014/6752/146752v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}}],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.smarta.com/advice/general/errol-damelin-wonga","title":"Smarta video"},{"external_url":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2008/jul/23/elevatorpitchwongafixestha","title":"The Guardian"}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/erroldamelin","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/Ed_Wonga","title":"Twitter"}]}
