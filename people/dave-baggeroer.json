Impressively, he can still drop his Râ€™s at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n\n<p>Dave&#8217;s earliest lessons in design came through countless hours with Legos and Lincoln Logs, model trains and Matchbox cars. Dave is convinced that when we played as kids we were already thinking like designers. As kids, weâ€™re not afraid to pick up some paint and express ourselves with our art. On the playground and in the sandbox our imagination is limitless. We instinctively build to think, love to play pretend, and aren&#8217;t afraid to learn by messing things up a bit. But somewhere along the path to adulthood we lose our creative confidence in the land of cubicles and Powerpoint.</p>\n\n<p>Dave works hard to maintain the creative footing we all had as kids. He is still learning by doing, playing pretend and messing things up. While a graduate student in Stanford&#8217;s Joint Program in Design, Daveâ€™s work focused on mobility and sustainability and included the design and fabrication of award-winning bicycle handlebars, sustainable running shoes and a drive-by-wire electric vehicle. As a research assistant with the Dynamic Design Lab he worked on future car concepts with funding from Nissan Motors and the Ford Foundation. He taught others how to build to think while teaching design and manufacturing at Stanford&#8217;s Product Realization Lab.</p>\n\n<p>Before graduate school Dave worked as a management consultant, software product manager, technology researcher, and entrepreneur. He started his first company as a sophomore in college and sold it before he graduated. He has degrees in engineering, business and design from Northwestern University and Stanford University. He studied studio art at the Gage Academy of Art. Dave&#8217;s design work has been recognized by Volvo, BusinessWeek, International Forum Design, The James Dyson Foundation, and the Industrial Designers Society of America.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://dschoolserver.stanford.edu/people/team_dave_baggeroer.php\" title=\"Institute of Design at Stanford\" rel=\"nofollow\">Institute of Design at Stanford</a></p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,78],"assets/images/resized/0008/8782/88782v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,130],"assets/images/resized/0008/8782/88782v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[363,190],"assets/images/resized/0008/8782/88782v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://dschoolserver.stanford.edu/people/team_dave_baggeroer.php\" title=\"Institute of Design at Stanford\" rel=\"nofollow\">Institute of Design at Stanford</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Northwestern University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Stanford University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Blockboard","permalink":"blockboard","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,32],"assets/images/resized/0007/2743/72743v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,54],"assets/images/resized/0007/2743/72743v6-max-250x250.png"],[[450,97],"assets/images/resized/0007/2743/72743v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davebags","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/davebags","title":"Twitter"}]}
