In 1994, I founded Lombard Brokerage, which pioneered online stock trading and invented many of the technologies used in banking, brokerage and insurance industries today.  </p>\n\n<p>In 1997 I sold Lombard to Morgan Stanley and was asked by CEO Phil Purcell to serve on their Management Committee at their world headquarters in New York, where I worked in marketing, e-commerce and internal acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2000, I was recruited by John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins (KPCB), and Ram Shriram of Sherpalo Ventures to be the CEO of Elance, a services marketplace on the web.  At the end of 2001, I left Elance to form Roach Capital Partners.  In 2006, I ran for Congress, in an effort to bring pragmatic leadership to our government.  </p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"","institution":"BYU","graduated_year":1990,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"MBA","subject":"","institution":"Pepperdine","graduated_year":1993,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"Elance","permalink":"elance","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,36],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,61],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-250x250.jpg"],[[377,92],"assets/images/resized/0001/7890/17890v11-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder/CEO","firm":{"name":"Lombard Brokerage","permalink":"lombard-brokerage","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP Marketing","firm":{"name":"Morgan Stanley","permalink":"morgan-stanley-2","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/veroach","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://xydo.com","title":"XYDO"},{"external_url":"http://roachpost.com","title":"Blog"}]}
