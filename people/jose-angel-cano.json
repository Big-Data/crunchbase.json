Not afraid of getting his hands dirty or running on a low budget, Jose is all about the big ideas.</p>\n\n<p>He has had a wide range of posts in the past, starting out in the Operations Center of Barclays Bank, before heading to BMW where he was responsible for the coordination of all BMW brands including BMW, MINI and Motorrad. After leaving his post there his ambitions took a decisive turn in the direction of online marketing and he went on to be employed by Fleurop-Interflora and later on at IVI. In these positions he was deeply involved in designing and implementing new online advertising strategies, experiences which unarguably led him to where he is now.</p>\n\n<p>Jose’s latest position is one he himself created: director of marketing at the job search startup wiseri.com. Wiseri is a company which he helped found and whose brand he has grown and developed right from its inception. He was a key player in the development of a unique crowdsourcing system which wiseri launched in January 2012, and is passionate about revolutionizing the concept of a traditional job portal.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0017/2446/172446v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,247],"assets/images/resized/0017/2446/172446v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[292,289],"assets/images/resized/0017/2446/172446v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Linkedin Profile</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Economics","institution":"Universidad de Zaragoza","graduated_year":2002,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Interuniversitary eBusiness Degree at G9 Universities Group","institution":"Universidad de Zaragoza","graduated_year":2007,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Advanced Marketing Online Course","institution":"ESIC: Business & Marketing School","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Bachelor","subject":"Bachelor of Business Administration","institution":"Universitat Oberta de Catalunya","graduated_year":2011,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Marketing Director & Founder ","firm":{"name":"wiseri","permalink":"wiseri","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,112],"assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,187],"assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,338],"assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[{"description":"Joined BMW - eCOM Responsible","stoned_year":2006,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/joseangelcano","source_text":null,"source_description":"LinkedIn Profile","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Angel Cano","permalink":"jose-angel-cano"}},{"description":"Joined Operations Centre at Barclays Bank","stoned_year":2003,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/joseangelcano","source_text":null,"source_description":"Linkedin profile","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Angel Cano","permalink":"jose-angel-cano"}},{"description":"Joined Fleurop-Interflora as Online Marketing & Sales Coordinator","stoned_year":2007,"stoned_month":11,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/joseangelcano","source_text":null,"source_description":"Linkedin profile","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Angel Cano","permalink":"jose-angel-cano"}},{"description":"Joined IVI as Online Marketing Manager","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":null,"source_url":"http://linkedin.com/in/joseangelcano","source_text":null,"source_description":"Linkedin profile","stoneable_type":"Person","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Angel Cano","permalink":"jose-angel-cano"}}],"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CVBidLPnpbo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>José Ángel Cano en FICOD</p>"}],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
