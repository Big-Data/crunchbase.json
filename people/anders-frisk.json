Mr. Frisk worked as advisor in sustainable development and related areas, mainly with larger international companies and Swedish municipalities.

Bern &amp; Partners focused on sustainable development and its implications to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. </p>\n\n<p>In 1998 Mr. Frisk co-founded Speed Ventures, a pan-European venture capital company. Mr. Frisk served as CEO of Speed Ventures from its inception until June 2001.
