As a Silicon Valley native for 13 years, Steve developed the proprietary Declone Duplicate Detection Engine building on duplicate data identification technology that he worked on while at Postini and Google.  His forward looking approach to developing solutions for corporate marketing led him to create a support portal which set the standard during several annual salesforce.com conferences as the desirable solution for an integrated support portal. Steve is known as an AppExchange visionary and his pioneering understanding of Cloud Computing with his belief in the likelihood of the success of salesforce.com led him to start RingLead and establish the company as the first certified ISV Salesforce partner. Belying his calm demeanor, Steve is a daredevil and likes to drive his Ducati and M5 very, very fast.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[123,150],"assets/images/resized/0017/6305/176305v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[206,250],"assets/images/resized/0017/6305/176305v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[270,327],"assets/images/resized/0017/6305/176305v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and President","firm":{"name":"Ringlead","permalink":"ringlead","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,47],"assets/images/resized/0017/6303/176303v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[229,72],"assets/images/resized/0017/6303/176303v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[229,72],"assets/images/resized/0017/6303/176303v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
