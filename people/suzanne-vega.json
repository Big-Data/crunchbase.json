Her profound insight into the basics of human existence has earned her followers of all ages and walks of life.</p>\n\n<p>Suzanne was born in Santa Monica, CA, on July 11, 1959. When she was about a year old, she moved with her mother to New York City, where she grew up in tough and mixed neighborhoods. She started writing poetry at the age of nine and song when she was fourteen. In her teens, she attended New York High School of Performing Arts â€” the â€œFameâ€ school â€” where she studied modern dance. It was, however, music that turned out to be her calling, and while she was an English lit. major at Barnard College, Columbia University, she would go down to the Village to perform at small venues. For a while, she belonged to the Coop/Fast Folk group of songwriters. In 1984, she finally got a major label record contract after an enthusiastic review in the New York Times. Today, Suzanne lives in Upper Manhattan, New York City, with her daughter Ruby (b. 1994).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[136,150],"assets/images/resized/0013/9610/139610v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[182,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/9610/139610v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[182,200],"assets/images/resized/0013/9610/139610v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Suzanne Vega Bio Page</p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"","subject":"","institution":"Barnard College, Columbia University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.suzannevega.com/","title":"Suzanne Vega"}]}
