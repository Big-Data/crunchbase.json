True story.\nI started programming around 10, my first serious application was a keep-alive for AOL connections so our dial-up wouldn&#8217;t time out. I had a stock broker in middle-school who I&#8217;d call from the pay-phone at lunch to trade stocks.\nIn High School, as a member of a team, I participated in, and won, a worldwide competition for the Internet Science and Technology Fair. We presented at the National Press Club in Washington DC to top executives in the industry.\nAs a first-semester freshman at Virginia Tech I landed a job at General Electric, which I took for the following summer. I followed that up with 2-1/2 years of school and a semester off for a job at ITT Nightvision, after which I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering and minor in Computer Science.\nI graduated and joined Westinghouse Electric Company as an engineer, and in a matter of 2-years, was promoted from engineer, to senior engineer, to project manager, where I lead the hardware and software design for Nuclear Reactor Safety systems.\nI left the corporate world to pursue my own company, during which time I became a volunteer firefighter, and created a custom content management system targeted at firehouses and rescue squads. Following a little over a year of this, I moved out West to San Francisco, where I worked on various contracts as a developer, and started several side projects (some featured on Thrillist, like TixSux), and others, more for fun (like CoffeeTalk).\nI finally found a niche in telephony, and co-founded TellFi, a YC funded company. And that&#8217;s where I am now.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0012/2423/122423v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0012/2423/122423v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0012/2423/122423v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"Bachelor of Science","subject":"Computer Engineering","institution":"Virginia Tech","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"Minor","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Virginia Tech","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder and CEO","firm":{"name":"TellFi","permalink":"tellfi","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[139,52],"assets/images/resized/0012/4364/124364v2-max-150x150.png"],[[139,52],"assets/images/resized/0012/4364/124364v2-max-250x250.png"],[[139,52],"assets/images/resized/0012/4364/124364v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Weotta","permalink":"weotta","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[107,62],"assets/images/resized/0013/5947/135947v2-max-150x150.png"],[[107,62],"assets/images/resized/0013/5947/135947v2-max-250x250.png"],[[107,62],"assets/images/resized/0013/5947/135947v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"TixSux","permalink":"tixsux","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/8930/68930v2-max-150x150.png"],[[124,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/8930/68930v2-max-250x250.png"],[[124,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/8930/68930v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"[coffee][talk]","permalink":"coffee-talk","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4819/64819v2-max-150x150.png"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4819/64819v2-max-250x250.png"],[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4819/64819v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"founder","firm":{"name":"TixSux","permalink":"tixsux","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[124,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/8930/68930v2-max-150x150.png"],[[124,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/8930/68930v2-max-250x250.png"],[[124,122],"assets/images/resized/0006/8930/68930v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Founder","firm":{"name":"pebb.ly","permalink":"pebb-ly","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/3811/73811v2-max-150x150.png"],[[225,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/3811/73811v2-max-250x250.png"],[[225,78],"assets/images/resized/0007/3811/73811v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://hosted-voip.tmcnet.com/feature/articles/73265-pebbly-introduce-its-innovative-cloud-marketing-platform-itexpo.htm","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.state.nj.us/education/news/2002/0613isf.htm","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.thrillist.com/nation/tixsux","title":""}],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/jsoncorwin","title":""},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/jsoncorwin","title":""}]}
