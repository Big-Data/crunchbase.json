After graduating from the University of Washington with honors in biochemistry, Leo decided to leave the medical field and aspired to become a management consultant. Having had no formal business training, Leo dropped in on accounting and finance classes and landed a job at Lake Partners, a well respected Seattle consulting firm. As a consultant, Leo focused on equities analysis and due diligence for a $7 billion hedge fund client. At one point, Leo&#8217;s personal trading portfolio was ranked within the top 10 on Covestor.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, Leo founded his first tech startup building a Twitter campaign management tool. When his first startup ran out of funding, Leo joined Amazon.com as a product manager and led the launch of several products focused on fulfillment and customer experience. A self taught developer, Monogram is Leo&#8217;s second startup. Why fashion? Because Leo owns over 30 pairs of designer shoes. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0020/9137/209137v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0020/9137/209137v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[240,240],"assets/images/resized/0020/9137/209137v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/leohjchen\" title=\"Leo Chen on LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leo Chen on LinkedIn</a></p>"},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Biochemistry ","institution":"University of Washington","graduated_year":2005,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO, Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Monogram","permalink":"monogram","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[144,144],"assets/images/resized/0020/9136/209136v1-max-150x150.png"],[[144,144],"assets/images/resized/0020/9136/209136v1-max-250x250.png"],[[144,144],"assets/images/resized/0020/9136/209136v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Product Manager","firm":{"name":"DianDian","permalink":"diandian","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[120,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/4141/144141v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[120,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/4141/144141v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[120,73],"assets/images/resized/0014/4141/144141v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Manager III, Software Dev. / Mobile Software Product Manager","firm":{"name":"Amazon","permalink":"amazon","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,66],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,89],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,89],"assets/images/resized/0000/3898/3898v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/leohjchen","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
