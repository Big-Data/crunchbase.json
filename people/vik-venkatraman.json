After Columbia University, he started his career as a brand manager at Red Bull where he learned consumer branding from a world-class team. He was a management consultant at Deloitte Consulting, where he traveled the world streamlining supply chains, coaxing mergers, and enacting strategy. He founded a beverage company, Star Power which was the first, only, and therefore biggest starfruit juice company in the US. He even published a book, Inspired. After starting V Bespoke with Dave, he saw that there was a great need to make the lives of normal people much better simply by getting them clothes that fit &#8211; a gift that then needed to be shared with the world. In addition to thinking big thoughts, Vik loves a classic charcoal suit, often spiced up with jeans or a waistcoat.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BS","subject":"Biomedical Engineering","institution":"Columbia University","graduated_year":2006,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","firm":{"name":"Clothes Horse","permalink":"clothes-horse","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,60],"assets/images/resized/0013/6405/136405v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,100],"assets/images/resized/0013/6405/136405v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,180],"assets/images/resized/0013/6405/136405v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://about.me/vikvenkat","title":"About Me"},{"external_url":"https://twitter.com/VikVenkat","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/vikvenkat","title":"LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"http://viktorio.us","title":"Viktorious Blog"}]}
