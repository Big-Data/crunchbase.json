He studied Philosophy and Business at Tulane University while turning his $12,415 Bar Mitzvah Gift money into a fully audited pre-tax sum of $1.65 million from 1999 to 2002 before founding his hedge fund, Cilantro Fund Management, LLC in 2003. He is also the benefactor of a Tulane University Scholarship, The Timothy Sykes Day Trading Award for the Talented that is awarded annually to any deserving Tulane student, faculty, or alumni.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006, his hedge fund was ranked the #1 Short-Bias Fund by Barclays for 2003-2006 and he was named to Trader Monthlyâ€™s 2006 â€˜Top 30 under 30â€², a list recognizing the top 30 investment professionals under the age of 30.</p>\n\n<p>In late-2007, after suffering a roughly 35% loss over two years, he closed his hedge fund and created a publishing company, BullShip Press, LLC to promote Freedom of Finance, the concept of a hedge fund managerâ€™s right to discuss their business freely without risk of penalty or censorship. Following this thinking, Timothy also introduced TIM, short for Transparent Investment Management, with the goal of repeating his original feat of turning $12,415 into $1.65 million, this time around detailing the step-by-step process on TimothySykes.com, becoming the first hedge fund manager to openly detail their investment strategies for all to see.</p>\n\n<p>Since the beginning of 2008, Timothy has been the #1 trader/investor, out of 25,000+ on Covestor.com, a website that tracks and verifies all trades, by earning 365% as the overall US stock market dropped 40%. More importantly, nearly 1/4 of the top 100 traders were PennyStocking DVD students or TIMalert subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>He also starred in the TV show, Wall Street Warriors on MOJO, now writes for AOL Finance and has been featured on ABC, CNN, CBS, CNBC, FOX News, FOX Business Network, Reuters, Businessweek, Marketwatch, MSN Money, Yahoo!
