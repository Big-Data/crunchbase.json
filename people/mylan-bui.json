Some wondered why she chose Australia. For MyLan Bui, the choice was clear. The designers from that country were creating some truly fantastic clothes, full of beautiful details and incredible styling. But they were having a hard time breaking into the US market. MyLan Bui knew she could help. Her firm, Bui-Lavry PR has the first showroom that&#8217;s focused only on Australia. By specializing in Australia, MyLan Bui has become an expert, and her clients are so thankful for her help.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,94],"assets/images/resized/0013/9453/139453v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,157],"assets/images/resized/0013/9453/139453v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,283],"assets/images/resized/0013/9453/139453v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
