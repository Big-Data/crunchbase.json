He graduated in 1999 from British Columbia Institute of Technology with a diploma in Computer Systems Technology. Over the next few years, he worked for several dot.com companies as the number of them in Vancouver began to wane. Markus ended up working at a company as a website and database administrator where he found and fixed errors.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Frind had to learn ASP.NET and to better learn the language, he built a dating website. The free dating website quickly grew in Canada and then spread, via word of mouth, to the U.K., Australia, and the United States. To keep the site free, Plentyoffish began using AdSense to generate revenue. The first cheque arrived in July 2003 and was for $1,100 USD.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004, PlentyofFish became a full-time business for Frind. He ran the site independently until 2007, when he began hiring other employees at his new Vancouver headquarters.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/4351/64351v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[167,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/4351/64351v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,299],"assets/images/resized/0006/4351/64351v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder (sole employee)","firm":{"name":"Plentyoffish","permalink":"plentyoffish","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[85,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/7147/17147v15-max-150x150.png"],[[85,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/7147/17147v15-max-250x250.png"],[[85,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/7147/17147v15-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
