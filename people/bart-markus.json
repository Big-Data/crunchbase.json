Apart from being a veteran VC, Bart is a seasoned and passionate entrepreneur and is renowned for his relentless drive (and lack of patience therein) to internationalise companies and helping them to become successful beyond Europe by conquering the US or Asia. A Dutch native, he has been a General Partner at Wellington since 2000. He primarily focuses on process technologies, in particular in the Electronics and Cleantech areas.</p>\n\n<p>Bart manages an impressive collection of companies located in Europe and the US. Many have already made the successful leap to the US or are successfully opening up new foreign markets. Past investments include Navteq (NASDAQ: NVT; sold to Nokia in 2007), Meiosys (sold to IBM in 2005), Nawotec (sold to Carl Zeiss in 2005) and Q-Layer (sold to Sun Microsystems in 2009).</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the past ten years which he spent as an investor in Tech companies, Bart has co-founded three companies including the MRI Centre, now a highly successful chain of private medical diagnostic clinics. He also set up and acted as CEO for ePearle, a pan-European B2B eCommerce start-up.</p>\n\n<p>Before Wellington, Bart was an investment professional at HAL Investments and an Associate at McKinsey working in Holland and South Africa. He started his career as a process control system and project engineer with Shell in Norway. Bart holds an MSc in Applied Physics from Twente University of Technology in The Netherlands and an MBA from INSEAD in France.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[75,150],"assets/images/resized/0007/6818/76818v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,250],"assets/images/resized/0007/6818/76818v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,300],"assets/images/resized/0007/6818/76818v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>Wellington Partners</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Partner","firm":{"name":"Wellington Partners","permalink":"wellington-partners","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,26],"assets/images/resized/0001/9753/19753v1-max-150x150.png"],[[237,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/9753/19753v1-max-250x250.png"],[[237,42],"assets/images/resized/0001/9753/19753v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","firm":{"name":"Enecsys","permalink":"enecsys","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0006/3714/63714v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0006/3714/63714v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[282,70],"assets/images/resized/0006/3714/63714v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"Replisaurus","permalink":"replisaurus","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","firm":{"name":"agnion","permalink":"agnion","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board member","firm":{"name":"Global Grind","permalink":"globalgrind","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0000/4477/4477v1-max-150x150.png"],[[181,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/4477/4477v1-max-250x250.png"],[[181,68],"assets/images/resized/0000/4477/4477v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"EnStorage","permalink":"enstorage","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0007/2481/72481v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0007/2481/72481v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[274,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/2481/72481v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
