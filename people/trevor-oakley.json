Now selling hundreds of thousands pounds of goods, he has learned the great value of consumer recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>These recommendations are so valuable that he has started a website which will publish consumer recommendations made in twitter. These recommendations are currently being published at www.fullbe.com.</p>\n\n<p>As of January 2010, there are about 4,000,000 recommendations in the database; in fact so many that the server cannot handle the load, so the actual live ones are limited to about 40,000 and linked to products.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.Sc.","subject":"Physics","institution":"Southampton","graduated_year":1986,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"M.Sc.","subject":"Control and IT","institution":"UMIST","graduated_year":1996,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Company Director","firm":{"name":"Merrows","permalink":"merrows","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/merrows","title":"@merrows"},{"external_url":"http://www.fullbe.com","title":"Fullbe"}]}
