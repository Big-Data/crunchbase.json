Okay, so he&#8217;s not really a kid â€“ he remembers vinyl records, so right there you know he&#8217;s over 21. But heâ€™s basically a kid who hasn&#8217;t grown up yet. Which means he brings a fresh, innovative and creative spin to everything he does in life. </p>\n\n<p>Take his role at trueAnthem, for instance. He&#8217;s helping pioneer a new way for independent and undiscovered artists and bands to get paid while sharing their music with their fans for free â€“ and without having to sign away their lives to a major record label. </p>\n\n<p>And Brad knows his other skills â€“ he has a history of creating, developing and managing companies that prosper â€“ will help grow trueAnthem into the modern music label of the digital age.</p>","image":null,"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","firm":{"name":"trueAnthem","permalink":"trueanthem","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,20],"assets/images/resized/0002/2243/22243v8-max-150x150.png"],[[173,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/2243/22243v8-max-250x250.png"],[[173,24],"assets/images/resized/0002/2243/22243v8-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
