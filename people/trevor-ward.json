He has spent more than twenty years in leadership positions at organizations like IntraLinks, Adobe Systems, Microsoft, and Lotus Development, and was most recently Vice President of UK and Ireland for IntraLinks.</p>\n\n<p>True to the customs of the United Kingdom, Trevor and his family live and breathe football (soccer). Or, as he would put it, &#8220;We are football mad!&#8221; He and the family are season ticket holders at the Reading FC stadium and his sons play for the Reading FC Youth Academy and Clubs Development Centre. Outside of work and watching football, Trevor keeps himself busy with healthy hobbies in running and coaching. He also likes getting his hands greasy working on motorcycles and cars in his garage.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[100,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/7470/217470v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0021/7470/217470v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,450],"assets/images/resized/0021/7470/217470v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>http://www.attask.com/executive-team</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager, EMEA","firm":{"name":"AtTask","permalink":"attask","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,45],"assets/images/resized/0002/0501/20501v4-max-150x150.png"],[[250,75],"assets/images/resized/0002/0501/20501v4-max-250x250.png"],[[450,135],"assets/images/resized/0002/0501/20501v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
