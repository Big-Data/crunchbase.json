The database was installed in a Fujitsu K300 mini-computer with several processors and installed in a 20 m2 room air conditioned 24 hours a day; it occupied half the room.</p>\n\n<p>From 1996 onwards, he created Madeinspain.net, an online hotel booking service in which he associated some 1,800 hotels in 18 months. It was a real achievement; he knew how to convince hotel owners of the need to highlight the difference even faced with the lack of awareness of the Internet at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, following two years of development, he inaugurated the most important Internet property project in Europe of the time: www.inmoworld.com, to then sell it to Globaliza Networks www.globaliza.com, with the participation of Grupo ALBA, one of the most important financial groups in Spain.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,100],"assets/images/resized/0003/4930/34930v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,166],"assets/images/resized/0003/4930/34930v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,300],"assets/images/resized/0003/4930/34930v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p>www.beimercader.es</p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://mercader.cocoloop.com","title":""},{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/mercader","title":""}]}
