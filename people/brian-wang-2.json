So he swapped (most of) his addiction for video games with an addiction for weight lifting. Prior to Fitocracy, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and spent two years working in management consulting. In his spare time he likes to rock out at metal shows and play some sweet licks on the guitar.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0022/150022v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0022/150022v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0015/0022/150022v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Economics","institution":"University of Pennsylvania","graduated_year":2008,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Cofounder, CEO","firm":{"name":"Fitocracy","permalink":"fitocracy","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,23],"assets/images/resized/0011/2778/112778v6-max-150x150.png"],[[250,38],"assets/images/resized/0011/2778/112778v6-max-250x250.png"],[[283,44],"assets/images/resized/0011/2778/112778v6-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/brianmwang","title":"Brian Wang's Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://brianmwang.tumblr.com","title":"Brian Wang's Blog"}]}
