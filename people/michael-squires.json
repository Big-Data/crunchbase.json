MICHAEL bases Softscribeâ€™s PR process on listening to each clientâ€™s goals and applying his companyâ€™s resources to achieve them with successful messaging campaigns. He notes that &#8220;most of Softscribe&#8217;s business meetings consist of us asking questions and listening.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>MICHAEL learns from clients and supports a positive workplace for his team to operate creatively and effectively. &#8220;Most professionals are highly effective in an environment of mutual respect and appreciation. Likewise, we recognize our clients know more about their businesses and markets than we do, and serve them from that standpoint. We work hard and smart to achieve every clientâ€™s goals. Thatâ€™s the air we breathe at Softscribe.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Michael is a well-traveled explorer whose axiom is: &#8220;I never met an airplane I didn&#8217;t likeâ€”I will fly, sail or drive anywhere.&#8221; His pleasure in discovery translates as an enjoyment in learning new technologies and industries to better serve clients. &#8220;The best, most effective sales process is to understand what you are selling and believe in its value,&#8221; SQUIRES notes. Michael directs Softscribe according to three important leadership tenets: take responsibility; if you make a mistake, apologize; and laugh as often as possible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[114,150],"assets/images/resized/0016/4550/164550v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[190,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/4550/164550v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[190,250],"assets/images/resized/0016/4550/164550v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"B.S.","subject":"Business/Marketing","institution":"Arizona State University","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null},{"degree_type":"","subject":"Business","institution":"University of Nevada-Reno","graduated_year":null,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President","firm":{"name":"Softscribe Inc.","permalink":"softscribe","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[149,150],"assets/images/resized/0006/7428/67428v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[248,250],"assets/images/resized/0006/7428/67428v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[447,450],"assets/images/resized/0006/7428/67428v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelsquires","title":"LinkedIn"}]}
