He first started off just publishing his cartoons, but as time wore on he started blogging about his other main interest i.e. marketing.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004 he wrote &#8220;How To Be Creative&#8221; and &#8220;The Hughtrain&#8221;, which both got widely read in the blogosphere.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005 he scored his first major blog marketing success with EnglishCut.com, a blog he started with Savile Row tailor, Thomas Mahon. It tripled Thomas&#8217; sales within six months.</p>\n\n<p>Since mid-2006 Hugh&#8217;s main occupation has been helping a small South African winery, Stormhoek &#8220;rise above the clutter&#8221; in the wine market by using Web 2.0 tools to get the word out. Sales have gone up fivefold since then, thanks to Hugh&#8217;s marketing efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2006 Hugh has been constantly engaged as a public speaker, giving talks in both Europe and the US, talking about Web 2.0 and the ramifications it has on business.</p>\n\n<p>Hugh&#8217;s basic mantra about blog marketing is &#8220;Blogs are a good way to make things happen indirectly&#8221;, a point lost on many corporate types.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[99,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7448/17448v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[166,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7448/17448v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[299,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/7448/17448v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":"<p><a href=\"http://sifry.com/alerts\" title=\"David Sifry\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Sifry</a></p>"},"degrees":[],"relationships":[],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
