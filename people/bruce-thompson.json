At 10 years old, he started selling milk from the family farm to local school bus drivers for $1 per gallon, and while attending MSU-Northern on a wrestling scholarship, Bruce studied marketing and business management. A few years later, after serving his time in the Military, Bruce found himself in S. Florida starting another business. This one rapidly grew into the largest motorized pool cover company in the SE. In 2004, craving for more time with his family and less travel, Bruce relinquished reigns to this thriving company with offices in 5 different states. </p>\n\n<p>A short time later, he was hired by State Farm to open an agency in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  Although his State Farm Agency achieved â€œTop 50â€ agency status by 2006, Bruce resigned and he and his family returned back to the Atlanta area to care for their ailing parents.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2007, The Thompson Group Insurance was founded and insured their first homeowner. Within months, the company was being recognized as a strong community advocate setting the stage for a bright future. The agency was awarded Chairmanâ€™s Circle (Top 5%) in 2007, Rookie of the Year award in 2008, Inner Circle (Top 2%) in 2008 &amp; 2009, and Presidentâ€™s Club (Top 10%) in 2010.   A dedication to give back is evident as Bruce serves on The Etowah Education Scholarship Board, Chamber of Commerce Executive Board, and as the Chair of Personnel Team at First Baptist Cartersville. </p>\n\n<p>He is frequently requested to speak at Allstate New Agency and Leaderâ€™s Forum seminars around the country. His new book is due out in July, and he hosts â€œMayhem in a Momentâ€ Saturday afternoons from 2-3 on AM 1270 WYXC.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[105,150],"assets/images/resized/0014/0735/140735v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[175,250],"assets/images/resized/0014/0735/140735v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[316,450],"assets/images/resized/0014/0735/140735v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Agency Owner","firm":{"name":"The Thompson Group","permalink":"the-thompson-group","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/Bruce.Anthony.Thompson","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bruceathompson","title":"flickr"},{"external_url":"http://www.thethompsongroupinsurance.com","title":"website"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/Mayheminamoment","title":"radio-Mayhem"}]}
