He started out with the development of a home medical equipment and respiratory company. Through a series of acquisitions and a consistently increasing customer base, the company soon became a leader in the industry and was the first company to develop wound healing protocols exclusively for Nursing Homes. These protocols were the preamble of Gentell and revolutionized wound care by providing education along with treatment options. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, David worked tirelessly with the National Association for the Support of Long Term Care (NASL) and chaired the committee responsible for having the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) recognize advanced wound care products. The result was a Congressional change to the Medicare Coverage Policies (Section 2079) to not only recognize wound care but to provide coverage for advanced wound care products. Today, many state health programs have been utilizing the Medicare parameters and adding coverage for wound care products.</p>\n\n<p>The Fastcare System captures images or video with the Gentell Fastcare tablet, sends encrypted messages to specialists who recommend a course of treatment, enables teleconferencing, and facilitates treatment supplies within 24 hours.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0021/4409/214409v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/4409/214409v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[200,200],"assets/images/resized/0021/4409/214409v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President","firm":{"name":"Gentell","permalink":"gentell","type_of_entity":"company","image":null}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[{"external_url":"http://www.twitter.com/davidanavazio","title":"David on Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-navazio/55/734/91","title":"David on LinkedIn"},{"external_url":"https://plus.google.com/109255792337798679383/posts","title":"David on Google+"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQmfmiBqxPCMfmCJVWjRrA","title":"David's YouTube Channel"}]}
