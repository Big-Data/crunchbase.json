This last is source of much mirth to college friends who knew him as a left-leaning liberal who wore Chaco sandals throughout most of the icy New England winters. After his internship at Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Process Driven Trading quant group, Adam became one of six employees tasked to start Enterprise Query Services, Morgan&#8217;s award-winning integrated accounting and financial reporting platform. In 2006 Adam moved back to his hometown, soon caught the start-up bug, and hasn&#8217;t looked back since.</p>\n\n<p>Adam Greene started SweetSpot in response to the lack of recognition of the familial and social impact of diabetes. SweetSpot grew out of Adam&#8217;s concern for his father and family and his desire to lighten the daily burden of dealing with diabetes.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/8019/18019v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[191,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/8019/18019v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[345,450],"assets/images/resized/0001/8019/18019v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""},"degrees":[{"degree_type":"BA","subject":"Computer Science","institution":"Bowdoin College","graduated_year":2001,"graduated_month":null,"graduated_day":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"","firm":{"name":"SweetSpot Diabetes Care","permalink":"sweetspot","type_of_entity":"company","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,28],"assets/images/resized/0003/8399/38399v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,47],"assets/images/resized/0003/8399/38399v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,85],"assets/images/resized/0003/8399/38399v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Software Architect; EQS","firm":{"name":"Morgan Stanley","permalink":"morgan-stanley","type_of_entity":"financial_org","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,53],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[237,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[237,85],"assets/images/resized/0002/9232/29232v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"investments":[],"milestones":[],"video_embeds":[],"external_links":[],"web_presences":[]}
